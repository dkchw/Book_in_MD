# FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE CELL 

Michael J. Caplan

In the minds of many students, the discipline of physiology is linked inextricably to images from its past. This prejudice is not surprising because many experiments from physiology's proud history, such as those of Pavlov on his dogs, have transcended mere scientific renown and entered the realm of popular culture. Some might believe that the science of physiology devotes itself exclusively to the study of whole animals and is therefore an antique relic in this era of molecular reductionism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Physiology is and always has been the study of the homeostatic mechanisms that allow an organism to persist despite the ever-changing pressures imposed by a hostile environment. These mechanisms can be appreciated at many different levels of resolution.

Certainly it would be difficult to understand how the body operates unless one appreciates the functions of its organs and the communication between these organs that allows them to influence one another's behaviors. It would also be difficult to understand how an organ performs its particular tasks unless one is familiar with the properties of its constituent cells and molecules.

The modern treatment of physiology that is presented in this textbook is as much about the interactions of molecules in cells as it is about the interactions of organs in organisms. It is necessary, therefore, at the outset to discuss the structure and characteristics of the cell. Our discussion focuses first on the architectural and dynamic features of a generic cell. We then examine how this generic cell can be adapted to serve in diverse physiological capacities. Through adaptations at the cellular level, organs acquire the machinery necessary to perform their individual metabolic tasks.

## STRUCTURE OF BIOLOGICAL MEMBRANES

## The surface of the cell is defined by a membrane

The chemical composition of the cell interior is very different from that of its surroundings. This observation applies equally to unicellular paramecia that swim freely in a freshwater pond and to neurons that are densely packed in the cerebral cortex of the human brain. The biochemical processes involved in cell function require the maintenance of a precisely regulated intracellular environment. The cytoplasm is an extraordinarily complex solution, the constituents of which include myriad proteins, nucleic acids, nucleotides,
and sugars that the cell synthesizes or accumulates at great metabolic cost. The cell also expends tremendous energy to regulate the intracellular concentrations of numerous ions. If there were no barrier surrounding the cell to prevent exchange between the intracellular and extracellular spaces, all of the cytoplasm's hard-won compositional uniqueness would be lost by diffusion in a few seconds.

The requisite barrier is provided by the plasma membrane, which forms the cell's outer skin. The plasma membrane is impermeable to large molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, thus ensuring their retention within the cytosol. It is selectively permeable to small molecules such as ions and metabolites. However, the metabolic requirements of the cell demand a plasma membrane that is much more sophisticated than a simple passive barrier that allows various substances to leak through at different rates. Frequently, the concentration of a nutrient in the extracellular fluid (ECF) is several orders of magnitude lower than that required inside the cell. If the cell wishes to use such a substance, therefore, it must be able to accumulate it against a concentration gradient. A simple pore in the membrane cannot concentrate anything; it can only modulate the rate at which a gradient dissipates. To accomplish the more sophisticated feat of creating a concentration gradient, the membrane must be endowed with special machinery that uses metabolic energy to drive the uphill movements of substancesactive transport-into or out of the cell. In addition, it would be useful to rapidly modulate the permeability properties of the plasma membrane in response to various metabolic stimuli. Active transport and the ability to control passive permeabilities underlie a wide range of physiological processes, from the electrical excitability of neurons to the resorptive and secretory functions of the kidney. In Chapter 5 , we will explore how cells actively transport solutes across the plasma membrane. The mechanisms through which the plasma membrane's dynamic selectivity is achieved, modified, and regulated are discussed briefly below in this chapter and in greater detail in Chapter 7.

## The cell membrane is composed primarily of phospholipids

Our understanding of biological membrane structure is based on studies of red blood cells, or erythrocytes, that were conducted in the early part of the 20th century. The

erythrocyte lacks the nucleus and other complicated intracellular structures that are characteristic of most animal cells. It consists of a plasma membrane surrounding a cytoplasm that is rich in hemoglobin. It is possible to break open erythrocytes and release their cytoplasmic contents. The plasma membranes can then be recovered by centrifugation to provide a remarkably pure preparation of cell surface membrane. Biochemical analysis reveals that this membrane is composed of two principal constituents: lipid and protein.

Most of the lipid associated with erythrocyte plasma membranes belongs to the molecular family of phospholipids. In general, phospholipids share a glycerol backbone, two hydroxyl groups of which are esterified to various fatty-acid or acyl groups (Fig. 2-1A). These acyl groups may have different numbers of carbon atoms and also may have double bonds between carbons. For glycerol-based phospholipids, the third glycerolic hydroxyl group is esterified to a phosphate group, which is in turn esterified to a small molecule referred to as a head group. The identity of the head group determines the name as well as many of the properties of the individual phospholipids. For instance, glycerol-based phospholipids that bear an ethanolamine molecule in the head group position are categorized as phosphatidylethanolamines (see Fig. 2-1A).

## Phospholipids form complex structures in aqueous solution

The unique structure and physical chemistry of each phospholipid (see Fig. 2-1B) underlie the formation of biological membranes and explain many of their most important properties. Fatty acids are nonpolar molecules. Their long carbon chains lack the charged groups that would facilitate interactions with water, which is polar. Consequently, fatty acids dissolve poorly in water but readily in organic solvents; thus, fatty acids are hydrophobic. On the other hand, the head groups of most phospholipids are charged or polar. These head groups interact well with water and consequently are very water soluble. Thus, the head groups are hydrophilic. Because phospholipids combine hydrophilic heads with hydrophobic tails, their interaction with water is referred to as amphipathic.

When mixed with water, phospholipids organize themselves into structures that prevent their hydrophobic tails from making contact with water while simultaneously permitting their hydrophilic head groups to be fully dissolved. When added to water at fairly low concentrations, phospholipids form a monolayer (see Fig. 2-1C) on the water's surface at the air-water interface. It is energetically less costly to the system for the hydrophobic tails to stick up in the air than to interact with the solvent.

At higher concentrations, phospholipids assemble into micelles. The hydrophilic head groups form the surfaces of these small spheres, whereas the hydrophobic tails point toward their centers. In this geometry, the tails are protected from any contact with water and instead are able to participate in energetically favorable interactions among themselves. At still higher concentrations, phospholipids spontaneously form bilayers (see Fig. 2-1D). In these structures, the phospholipid molecules arrange themselves into two parallel sheets or leaflets that face each other tail to tail. The hydrophilic head groups form the surfaces of the bilayer; the hydrophobic tails form the center of the sandwich. The hydrophilic surfaces insulate the hydrophobic tails from

contact with the solvent, leaving the tails free to associate exclusively with one another.

The physical characteristics of a lipid bilayer largely depend on the chemical composition of its constituent phospholipid molecules. For example, the width of the bilayer is determined by the length of the fatty-acid side chains. Dihexadecanoic phospholipids (whose two fatty-acid chains are each 16 carbons long) produce bilayers that are 2.47 nm wide; ditetradecanoic phospholipids (bearing 14-carbon fatty acids) generate $2.3-\mathrm{nm}$ bilayers. Similarly, the nature of the head groups determines how densely packed adjacent phospholipid molecules are in each leaflet of the membrane.

Detergents can dissolve phospholipid membranes because, like the phospholipids themselves, they are amphipathic. They possess very hydrophilic head groups and hydrophobic tails and are water soluble at much higher concentrations than are the phospholipids. When mixed together in aqueous solutions, detergent and phospholipid molecules interact through their hydrophobic tails, and the resulting complexes are water soluble, either as individual dimers or in mixed micelles. Therefore, adding sufficient concentrations of detergent to phospholipid bilayer membranes disrupts the membranes and dissolves the lipids. Detergents are extremely useful tools in research into the structure and composition of lipid membranes.

## The diffusion of individual lipids within a leaflet of a bilayer is determined by the chemical makeup of its constituents

Despite its highly organized appearance, a phospholipid bilayer is a fluid structure. An individual phospholipid molecule is free to diffuse within the entire leaflet in which it resides. The rate at which this two-dimensional diffusion occurs is extremely temperature dependent. At high temperatures, the thermal energy of any given lipid molecule is greater than the interaction energy that would tend to hold adjacent lipid molecules together. Under these conditions, lateral diffusion can proceed rapidly, and the lipid is said to be in the sol state. At lower temperatures, interaction energies exceed the thermal energies of most individual molecules. Thus, phospholipids diffuse slowly because they lack the energy to free themselves from the embraces of their neighbors. This behavior is characteristic of the gel state.

The temperature at which the bilayer membrane converts from the gel to the sol phase (and vice versa) is referred to as the transition temperature. The transition temperature is another characteristic that depends on the chemical makeup of the phospholipids in the bilayer. Phospholipids with long, saturated fatty-acid chains can extensively interact with one another. Consequently, a fair amount of thermal energy is required to overcome these interactions and permit diffusion. Not surprisingly, such bilayers have relatively high transition temperatures. For example, the transition temperature for dioctadecanoic phosphatidylcholine (which has two 18-carbon fatty-acid chains, fully saturated) is $55.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. In contrast, phospholipids that have shorter fatty-acid chains or double bonds (which introduce kinks) cannot line up next to each other as well and hence do not interact as well.

Considerably less energy is required to induce them to participate in diffusion. For example, if we reduce the length of the carbon chain from 18 to 14 , the transition temperature falls to $23^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. If we retain 18 carbons but introduce one double bond (making the fatty-acid chains monounsaturated), the transition temperature also falls dramatically.

By mixing other types of lipid molecules into phospholipid bilayers, we can markedly alter the membrane's fluidity properties. The glycerol-based phospholipids, the most common membrane lipids, include the phosphatidylethanolamines described above (see Fig. 2-1A), as well as the phosphatidylinositols (Fig. 2-2A), phosphatidylserines (see Fig. 2-2B), and phosphatidylcholines (see Fig. 2-2C). The second major class of membrane lipids, the sphingolipids (derivatives of sphingosine), is made up of three subgroups: sphingomyelins (see Fig. 2-2D), N2-1 glycosphingolipids such as the galactocerebrosides (see Fig. 2-2E), and gangliosides (not shown in figure). Cholesterol (see Fig. 2-2F) is another important membrane lipid. Because these other molecules are not shaped exactly like the glycerolbased phospholipids, they participate to different degrees in intermolecular interactions with phospholipid side chains. (○ N2-2 The presence of these alternative lipids changes the strength of the interactions that prevents lipid molecules from diffusing. Consequently, the membrane has a different fluidity and a different transition temperature. This behavior is especially characteristic of the cholesterol molecule, whose rigid steroid ring binds to and partially immobilizes fattyacid side chains. Therefore, at modest concentrations, cholesterol decreases fluidity. However, when it is present in high concentrations, cholesterol can substantially disrupt the ability of the phospholipids to interact among themselves, which increases fluidity and lowers the gel-sol transition temperature. This issue is significant because animal cell plasma membranes can contain substantial quantities of cholesterol.

Bilayers composed of several different lipids do not undergo the transition from gel to sol at a single, well-defined temperature. Instead, they interconvert more gradually over a temperature range that is defined by the composition of the mixture. Within this transition range in such multicomponent bilayers, the membrane can become divided into compositionally distinct zones. The phospholipids with long-chain, saturated fatty acids will adhere to one another relatively tightly, which results in the formation of regions with gel-like properties. Phospholipids bearing short-chain, unsaturated fatty acids will be excluded from these regions and migrate to sol-like regions. Hence, "lakes" of lipids with markedly different physical properties can exist side by side in the plane of a phospholipid membrane. Thus, the same thermodynamic forces that form the elegant bilayer structure can partition distinct lipid domains within the bilayer. As discussed below, the segregation of lipid lakes in the plane of the membrane may be important for sorting membrane proteins to different parts of the cell.

Although phospholipids can diffuse in the plane of a lipid bilayer membrane, they do not diffuse between adjacent leaflets (Fig. 2-3). The rate at which phospholipids spontaneously "flip-flop" from one leaflet of a bilayer to the other is extremely low. As mentioned above, the center of a bilayer membrane consists of the fatty-acid tails of the phospholipid

The polar head group of sphingomyelins can be either phosphocholine, as shown in Figure 2-2D, or phosphoethanolamine (analogous to the phosphoethanolamine moiety in Fig. 2-1A). Note that sphingomyelins are both (1) sphingolipids because they contain sphingosine, and (2) phospholipids because they contain a phosphate group as do the glycerol-based phospholipids shown in Figures 2-1A and 2-2A-C.

molecules and is an extremely hydrophobic environment. For a phospholipid molecule to jump from one leaflet to the other, its highly hydrophilic head group would have to transit this central hydrophobic core, which would have an extremely high energy cost. This caveat does not apply to cholesterol (see Fig. 2-3), whose polar head is a single hydroxyl group. The energy cost of dragging this small polar hydroxyl group through the bilayer is relatively low, which permits relatively rapid cholesterol flip-flop.

## Phospholipid bilayer membranes are impermeable to charged molecules

The lipid bilayer is ideally suited to separate two aqueous compartments. Its hydrophilic head groups interact well with water at both membrane surfaces, whereas the hydrophobic center ensures that the energetic cost of crossing the membrane is prohibitive for charged atoms or molecules. Pure phospholipid bilayer membranes are extremely

![bo094543376c](bo094543376c.jpg)

impermeable to almost any charged water-soluble substance. Ions such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are insoluble in the hydrophobic membrane core and consequently cannot travel from the aqueous environment on one side of the membrane to the aqueous environment on the opposite side. The same is true of large water-soluble molecules, such as proteins, nucleic acids, sugars, and nucleotides.

Whereas phospholipid membranes are impermeable to water-soluble molecules, small uncharged polar molecules can cross fairly freely. This is often true for $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{3}$, and, remarkably, water itself. Water molecules may, at least in part, traverse the membrane through transient cracks between the hydrophobic tails of the phospholipids without having to surmount an enormous energetic barrier. The degree of permeability of water (and perhaps that of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ as well) varies extensively with lipid composition; some phospholipids (especially those with short or kinked fattyacid chains) permit a much greater rate of transbilayer water diffusion than others do.

## The plasma membrane is a bilayer

As may be inferred from the preceding discussion, the membrane at the cell surface is, in fact, a phospholipid bilayer. The truth of this statement was established by a remarkably straightforward experiment. In 1925, Gorter and Grendel measured the surface area of the lipids they extracted from erythrocyte plasma membranes. They used a device called a Langmuir trough in which the lipids are allowed to line up at an air-water interface (see Fig. 2-1C) and are then packed together into a continuous monolayer by a sliding bar that decreases the surface available to them. The area of the monolayer that was created by the erythrocyte lipids was exactly twice the surface area of the erythrocytes from which they were derived. Therefore, the plasma membrane must be a bilayer.

Confirmation of the bilayer structure of biological membranes has come from x-ray diffraction studies performed on the repetitive whorls of membrane that form the myelin sheaths surrounding neuronal axons (see pp. 292-293).

The membran's bilayer structure can be visualized directly in the high-magnification electron micrograph depicted in Figure 2-4. The osmium tetraoxide molecule $\left(\mathrm{OsO}_{4}\right)$ with which the membrane is stained binds to the head groups of phospholipids. Thus, both surfaces of a phospholipid bilayer appear black in electron micrographs,

The inset is a high-magnification view (original magnification $\times 216,000$ ) of the plasma membranes (PM) of the cells. Note that each membrane includes two dense layers with an intermediate layer of lower density. The dense layers represent the interaction of the polar head groups of the phospholipids with the $\mathrm{OsO}_{4}$ used to stain the preparation. E, nuclear envelope; M, mitochondrion.

whereas the membrane's unstained central core appears white.

The phospholipid compositions of the two leaflets of the plasma membrane are not identical. Labeling studies performed on erythrocyte plasma membranes reveal that the surface that faces the cytoplasm contains phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, whereas the outward-facing leaflet is composed almost exclusively of phosphatidylcholine. As is discussed below in this chapter, this asymmetry is created during the biosynthesis of the phospholipid molecules. It is not entirely clear what advantage this distribution provides to the cell. The interactions between certain proteins and the plasma membrane may require this segregation. The lipid asymmetry may be especially important for those phospholipids that are involved in second-messenger cascades. Phosphatidylinositols, for example, give rise to phosphoinositides, which play critical roles in signaling pathways (see pp. 58-61). In addition, the phosphatidylinositol composition of the cytoplasmic face of an organelle helps to define the identity of the organelle and to govern its trafficking and targeting properties. Finally, the phospholipids that are characteristic of animal cell plasma membranes generally have one saturated and one

unsaturated fatty-acid residue. Consequently, they are less likely to partition into sol-like or gel-like lipid domains than are phospholipids that bear identical fatty-acid chains. N2-3

## Membrane proteins can be integrally or peripherally associated with the plasma membrane

The demonstration that the plasma membrane's lipid components form a bilayer leaves open the question of how the membrane's protein constituents are organized. Membrane proteins can belong to either of two broad classes, peripheral or integral. Peripherally associated membrane proteins are neither embedded within the membrane nor attached to it by covalent bonds; instead, they adhere tightly to the cytoplasmic or extracellular surfaces of the plasma membrane (Fig. 2-5A). They can be removed from the membrane, however, by mild treatments that disrupt ionic bonds (very high salt concentrations) or hydrogen bonds (very low salt concentrations).

In contrast, integral membrane proteins are intimately associated with the lipid bilayer. They cannot be eluted from the membrane by these high- or low-salt washes. For integral membrane proteins to be dislodged, the membrane itself must be dissolved by adding detergents. Integral membrane proteins can be associated with the lipid bilayer in any of three ways. First, some proteins actually span the lipid bilayer once or several times (see Fig. 2-5B, C) and hence are referred to as transmembrane proteins. Experiments performed on erythrocyte membranes reveal that these proteins can be labeled with protein-tagging reagents applied to either side of the bilayer.

The second group of integral membrane proteins is embedded in the bilayer without actually crossing it (see Fig. 2-5D). A third group of membrane-associated proteins is not actually embedded in the bilayer at all. Instead, these lipid-anchored proteins are attached to the membrane by a covalent bond that links them either to a lipid component of the membrane or to a fatty-acid derivative that intercalates into the membrane. For example, proteins can be linked to a special type of glycosylated phospholipid molecule (see Fig. 2-5E), which is most often glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), on the outer leaflet of the membrane. This family is referred to collectively as the glycophospholipidlinked proteins. Another example is a direct linkage to a fatty acid (e.g., a myristyl group) or a prenyl (e.g., farnesyl) group that intercalates into the inner leaflet of the membrane (see Fig. 2-5F).

## The membrane-spanning portions of transmembrane proteins are usually hydrophobic $\alpha$ helices

How can membrane-spanning proteins remain stably associated with the bilayer in a conformation that requires at least some portion of their amino-acid sequence to be in continuous contact with the membrane's hydrophobic central core? The answer to this question can be found in the special structures of those protein domains that actually span the membrane.

The side chains of the eight amino acids listed in the upper portion of Table 2-1 are hydrophobic. These aromatic or uncharged aliphatic groups are almost as difficult to solvate in water as are the fatty-acid side chains of the membrane phospholipids themselves. Not surprisingly, therefore,

# N2-3 Membrane Microdomains 

## Contributed by Michael Caplan

According to current models (see Anderson and Jacobson, 2002; Edidin, 2003), lipids and proteins are not uniformly distributed in the plane of the membranes that surround cells and organelles. Instead, certain lipids and associated proteins cluster to form microdomains that differ in composition, structure, and function from the rest of the membrane that surrounds them. These microdomains can be thought of as small islands bordered by the "lake" of lipids and proteins that constitute the bulk of the membrane. These two-dimensional structures are composed of lipids that tend to form close interactions with one another, resulting in the self-assembly of organized domains that include specific types of lipids and exclude others. The lipids that tend to be found in microdomains include sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and glycolipids. Proteins that are able to interact closely with microdomainforming lipids can also become selectively incorporated into these microdomains. A number of different names are used to refer to these microdomains, the most common of which are caveolae and rafts.

Caveolae (see pp. 42-43) were originally identified in the electron microscope as flask-shaped invaginations of the plasma membrane. They carry a coat composed of proteins called caveolins, and they tend to be at least 50 to 80 nm in diameter. Caveolae have been shown to participate in endocytosis of specific subsets of proteins and are also richly endowed with signaling molecules, such as receptor tyrosine kinases.

Rafts are less well understood structures, which are defined by the biochemical behaviors of their constituents when the surrounding membrane is dissolved in nonionic detergents. Lipid microdomains rich in sphingomyelin, cholesterol, and glycolipids tend to resist solubilization in these detergents under certain
conditions and can be recovered intact by density centrifugation. Once again, a number of interesting proteins involved in cell signaling and communication, including kinases, ion channels, and G proteins, tend to be concentrated in rafts, or to become associated with rafts upon the activation of specific signaltransduction pathways. Rafts are thought to collect signaling proteins into small, highly concentrated zones, thereby facilitating their interactions and hence their ability to activate particular pathways. Rafts are also involved in membrane trafficking processes. In polarized epithelial cells, the sorting of a number of proteins to the apical plasma membrane is dependent upon their ability to partition into lipid rafts that form in the plane of the membrane of the trans-Golgi network. Little is known about what lipid rafts actually look like in cell membranes in situ. It is currently thought that they are fairly small ( $<100 \mathrm{~nm}$ ), although it is possible that they can be induced to coalesce into larger structures under certain circumstances. Much remains to be learned about the structures and functions of rafts and caveolae, but it is clear that they are dynamic and important entities that subdivide membrane into specialized regions that cells exploit for a wide variety of tasks.

*Kyte and Doolittle generated these values (arbitrary scale from -4.5 to +4.5 ) by averaging two kinds of data. The first is an index of the energy that is required to transfer the side chain from the vapor phase into water. The second indicates how likely it is to find the side chain buried in las opposed to being on the surface off. 12 globular proteins, whose structures were solved by x-ray crystallography. A positive value indicates that the side chain is hydrophobic. (From Kyte J, Doolittle RF: A simple method for displaying the hydropathic character of a protein. J Mol Biol 157:105-132, 1982.)
these hydrophobic side chains are quite comfortable in the hydrophobic environment of the bilayer core. Most membrane-spanning segments-that is, the short stretches of amino acids that pass through the membrane once-are composed mainly of these nonpolar amino acids, in concert with polar, uncharged amino acids.

The hydrophobic, membrane-spanning segments of transmembrane proteins are specially adapted to the
hydrophobic milieu in which they reside. The phospholipid molecules of the membrane bilayer actually protect these portions of transmembrane proteins from energetically unfavorable interactions with the aqueous environment. Transmembrane proteins tend to be extremely insoluble in water. If we separate the membrane-spanning segments of these proteins from the amphipathic phospholipids that surround them, these hydrophobic sequences tend to

interact tightly with one another rather than with water. The resulting large protein aggregates are generally insoluble and precipitate out of solution. If, however, we disrupt the phospholipid membrane by adding detergent, the amphipathic detergent molecules can substitute for the phospholipids. The hydrophobic membrane-spanning sequences remain insulated from interactions with the aqueous solvent, and the proteins remain soluble as components of detergent micelles. This ability of detergents to remove transmembrane proteins from the lipid bilayer-while maintaining the solubility and native architectures of these proteinshas proved important for purifying individual membrane proteins.

Transmembrane proteins can have a single membranespanning segment (see Fig. 2-5B) or several (see Fig. 2-5C). Those with a single transmembrane segment can be oriented with either their amino ( N ) or their carboxyl (C) terminus facing the extracellular space. Multispanning membrane proteins weave through the membrane like a thread through cloth. Again, the N and C termini can be exposed to either the cytoplasmic or extracellular compartments. The pattern with which the transmembrane protein weaves across the lipid bilayer defines its membrane topology.

The amino-acid sequences of membrane-spanning segments tend to form $\alpha$ helices, with $\sim 3.6$ amino acids per turn of the helix (see Fig. 2-5B). In this conformation, the polar atoms of the peptide backbone are maximally hydrogen bonded to one another-from one turn of the helix to the next-so they do not require the solvent to contribute hydrogen-bond partners. Hence, this structure ensures the solubility of the membrane-spanning sequence in the hydrophobic environment of the membrane. Whereas most transmembrane proteins appear to traverse the membrane with $\alpha$-helical spans, it is clear that an intriguing subset of membrane polypeptides makes use of a very different structure. For example, the porin protein (see p. 109), which serves as a channel in bacterial membranes, has membrane-spanning portions arranged as a $\beta$ barrel.

In the case of multispanning membrane proteins, their transmembrane helices probably pack together tightly (see Fig. 2-5C). Molecular analysis of a number of known membrane-spanning sequences has helped in the development of algorithms predicting the likelihood that a given amino-acid sequence can span the membrane. These algorithms are widely used to assess the likelihood that newly identified genes encode transmembrane proteins and to predict the number and location of membrane-spanning segments.

Many membrane proteins form tight, noncovalent associations with other membrane proteins in the plane of the bilayer. These multimeric proteins can be composed of a single type of polypeptide or of mixtures of two or more different proteins. The side-to-side interactions that hold these complexes together can involve the membranespanning segments or regions of the proteins that protrude at either surface of the bilayer. By assembling into multimeric complexes, membrane proteins can increase their stability. They can also increase the variety and complexity of the functions that they are capable of performing.

## Some membrane proteins are mobile in the plane of the bilayer

As is true for phospholipid molecules (see Fig. 2-3), some transmembrane proteins can diffuse within the surface of the membrane. In the absence of any protein-protein attachments, transmembrane proteins are free to diffuse over the entire surface of a membrane. This fact was demonstrated by Frye and Edidin in 1970 (Fig. 2-6). They labeled the surface proteins of a population of mouse lymphocytes with a lectin (a plant protein that binds strongly to certain sugar groups attached to proteins) that was linked to the fluorescent dye fluorescein. They also tagged the surface proteins of a second population of human lymphocytes with a lectin that was conjugated to a different fluorescent dye, rhodamine. Because fluorescein glows green and rhodamine glows red when

Figure 2-6 Diffusion of membrane proteins within the plane of the cell membrane. The surface proteins of a human lymphocyte are tagged with a lectin conjugated to rhodamine, a fluorescent dye; the surface proteins of a mouse lymphocyte are tagged with a lectin linked to fluorescein, another fluorescent dye. Immediately after fusion of the two cells, the labeled surface proteins remain segregated. However, the membrane proteins intermingle during a period of $\sim 30$ minutes.

excited by the light of the appropriate wavelengths, these labeling molecules can be easily distinguished from one another in a fluorescence microscope. Frye and Edidin mixed the two lymphocyte populations and treated them with a reagent that caused the cells to fuse to each other. Immediately after fusion, the labeled surface proteins of the newly joined cells remained separate; half of the fused cell surface appeared red, whereas the other half appeared green. During a period of $\sim 30$ minutes, however, the green and red protein labels intermixed until the entire surface of the fused cell was covered with both labeling molecules. The rate at which this intermingling occurred increased with temperature, which is not surprising given the temperature dependence of membrane fluidity.

Because transmembrane proteins are large molecules, their diffusion in the plane of the membrane is much slower than that of lipids. Even the fastest proteins diffuse $\sim 1000$ times more slowly than the average phospholipid. The diffusion of many transmembrane proteins appears to be further impeded by their attachments to the cytoskeleton, just below the surface of the membrane. Tight binding to this meshwork can render proteins essentially immobile. Other transmembrane proteins appear to travel in the plane of the membrane via directed processes that are much faster and less directionally random than diffusion is. Motor proteins that are associated with the cytoplasmic cytoskeleton (discussed below) appear to grab onto certain transmembrane proteins, dragging them in the plane of the membrane like toy boats on strings. Finally, like phospholipids, proteins can
diffuse only in the plane of the bilayer. They cannot flip-flop across it. The energetic barrier to dragging a transmembrane protein's hydrophilic cytoplasmic and extracellular domains across the bilayer's hydrophobic core is very difficult to surmount. Thus, a membrane protein's topology does not change over its life span.

## FUNCTION OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS

## Integral membrane proteins can serve as receptors

All communication between a cell and its environment must involve or at least pass through the plasma membrane. For the purposes of this discussion, we define communication rather broadly as the exchange of any signal between the cell and its surroundings. Except for lipid-soluble signaling molecules such as steroid hormones, essentially all communication functions served by the plasma membrane occur via membrane proteins. From an engineering perspective, membrane proteins are perfectly situated to transmit signals because they form a single, continuous link between the two compartments that are separated by the membrane.

Ligand-binding receptors comprise the group of transmembrane proteins that perhaps most clearly illustrate the concept of transmembrane signaling (Fig. 2-7A). For watersoluble hormones such as epinephrine to influence cellular behavior, their presence in the ECF compartment must be made known to the various intracellular mechanisms whose behaviors they modulate. The interaction of a hormone with

A LIGAND-BINDING RECEPTOR

Figure 2-7 Integral membrane proteins that transmit signals from the outside to the inside of a cell. A, The ligand may be a hormone, a growth factor, a neurotransmitter, an odorant, or another local mediator. B, An integrin is an adhesion molecule that attaches the cell to the extracellular matrix.

the extracellular portion of the hormone receptor, which forms a high-affinity binding site, produces conformational changes within the receptor protein that extend through the membrane-spanning domain to the intracellular domain of the receptor. As a consequence, the intracellular domain either becomes enzymatically active or can interact with cytoplasmic proteins that are involved in the generation of so-called second messengers. Either mechanism completes the transmission of the hormone signal across the membrane. The transmembrane disposition of a hormone receptor thus creates a single, continuous communication medium that is capable of conveying, through its own structural modifications, information from the environment to the cellular interior. The process of transmembrane signal transduction is discussed in Chapter 3.

## Integral membrane proteins can serve as adhesion molecules

Cells can also exploit integral membrane proteins as adhesion molecules that form physical contacts with the surrounding extracellular matrix (i.e., cell-matrix adhesion molecules) or with their cellular neighbors (i.e., cell-cell adhesion molecules). These attachments can be extremely important in regulating the shape, growth, and differentiation of cells. The nature and extent of these attachments must be communicated to the cell interior so that the cell can adapt appropriately to the physical constraints and cues that are provided by its immediate surroundings. Numerous classes of transmembrane proteins are involved in these communication processes. The integrins are examples of matrix receptors or cell-matrix adhesion molecules. They comprise a large family of transmembrane proteins that link cells to components of the extracellular matrix (e.g., fibronectin, laminin) at adhesion plaques (see Fig. 2-7B). These linkages produce conformational changes in the integrin molecules that are transmitted to their cytoplasmic tails. These tails, in turn, communicate the linkage events to various structural and signaling molecules that participate in formulating a cell's response to its physical environment.

In contrast to matrix receptors, which attach cells to the extracellular matrix, several enormous superfamilies of cellcell adhesion molecules attach cells to each other. These cell-cell adhesion molecules include the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent cell adhesion molecules (cadherins) and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent neural cell adhesion molecules (N-CAMs). The cadherins are glycoproteins (i.e., proteins with sugars attached) with one membrane-spanning segment and a large extracellular domain that binds $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The N-CAMs, on the other hand, generally are members of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The two classes of cell-cell adhesion molecules mediate similar sorts of transmembrane signals that help organize the cytoplasm and control gene expression in response to intercellular contacts. Some cell-cell adhesion molecules belong to the GPI-linked class of membrane proteins (see p. 13). These polypeptides lack a transmembrane and cytoplasmic tail. Interactions mediated by this unique class of adhesion molecules may be communicated to the cell interior via lateral associations with other membrane proteins.

Adhesion molecules orchestrate processes that are as diverse as the directed migration of immune cells and the
guidance of axons in the developing nervous system. Loss of cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion is a hallmark of metastatic tumor cells.

## Integral membrane proteins can carry out the transmembrane movement of water-soluble substances

As noted above, a pure phospholipid bilayer does not have the permeability properties that are normally associated with animal cell plasma membranes. Pure phospholipid bilayers also lack the ability to transport substances uphill (i.e., against electrochemical gradients; p. 105). Transmembrane proteins endow biological membranes with these capabilities. Ions and other membrane-impermeable substances can cross the bilayer with the assistance of transmembrane proteins that serve as pores, channels, carriers, and pumps. Pores and channels serve as conduits that allow water, specific ions, or even very large proteins to flow passively through the bilayer. Carriers can either facilitate the transport of a specific molecule across the membrane or couple the transport of a molecule to that of other solutes. Pumps use the energy that is released through the hydrolysis of ATP to drive the transport of substances into or out of cells against energy gradients. Each of these important classes of proteins is discussed in Chapter 5.

Channels, carriers, and pumps succeed in allowing hydrophilic substances to cross the membrane by creating a hydrophilic pathway in the bilayer. Previously, we asserted that membrane-spanning segments are as hydrophobic as the fatty acids that surround them. How is it possible for these hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains to produce the hydrophilic pathways that permit the passage of ions through the membrane? The solution to this puzzle appears to be that the $\alpha$ helices that make up these membrane-spanning segments are amphipathic. That is, they possess both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains.

For each $\alpha$ helix, the helical turns produce alignments of amino acids that are spaced at regular intervals in the sequence. Thus, it is possible to align all the hydrophilic or hydrophobic amino acids along a single edge of the helix. In amphipathic helices, hydrophobic amino acids alternate with hydrophilic residues at regular intervals of approximately three or four amino acids (recall that there are $\sim 3.6$ amino acids per turn of the helix). Thus, as the helices pack together, side by side, the resultant membrane protein has distinct hydrophilic and hydrophobic surfaces. The hydrophobic surfaces of each helix will face either the membrane lipid or the hydrophobic surfaces of neighboring helices. Similarly, the hydrophilic surfaces of each helix will face a common central pore through which water-soluble substances can move. Depending on how the protein regulates access to this pore, the protein could be a channel, a carrier, or a pump. The mix of hydrophilic amino acids that line the pore presumably determines, at least in part, the nature of the substances that the pore can accommodate. In some instances, the amphipathic helices that line the pore are contributed by several distinct proteins-or subunits-that assemble into a single multimeric complex. Figure 2-8 shows an example of a type of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel discussed on page 184. This channel is formed by the apposition of four identical subunits, each of which has

Figure 2-8 Amphipathic $\alpha$ helices interacting to form a channel through the cell membrane. This is an example of a potassium channel.
six membrane-spanning segments. The pore of this channel is created by the amphipathic helices as well as by short, hydrophilic loops (P loops) contributed by each of the four subunits.

## Integral membrane proteins can also be enzymes

Ion pumps are actually enzymes. They catalyze the hydrolysis of ATP and use the energy released by that reaction to drive ion transport. Many other classes of proteins that are embedded in cell membranes function as enzymes as well. Membrane-bound enzymes are especially prevalent in the cells of the intestine, which participate in the final stages of nutrient digestion and absorption (see pp. 916-918). These enzymes-located on the side of the intestinal cells that faces the lumen of the intestine-break down small polysaccharides into single sugars, or break down polypeptides into shorter polypeptides or amino acids, so that they can be imported into the cells. By embedding these enzymes in the plasma membrane, the cell can generate the final products of digestion close to the transport proteins that mediate the uptake of these nutrient molecules. This theme is repeated in numerous other cell types. Thus, the membrane can serve as an extremely efficient two-dimensional reaction center for multistep processes that involve enzymatic reactions or transport.

Many of the GPI-linked proteins are enzymes. Several of the enzymatic activities that are classically thought of as extracellular markers of the plasma membrane, such as alkaline phosphatase, $5^{\prime}$-nucleotidase, and carbonic anhydrase IV (see p. 828), are anchored to the external leaflet of the bilayer by covalent attachment to a GPI.

## Integral membrane proteins can participate in intracellular signaling

Some integral proteins associate with the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane by covalently attaching to fatty acids or prenyl groups that in turn intercalate into the lipid bilayer (see Fig. 2-5F). The fatty acids or prenyl groups act as hydrophobic tails that anchor an otherwise soluble protein to the bilayer. These proteins are all located at the intracellular leaflet of the membrane bilayer and often participate in intracellular signaling pathways. The family of lipid-linked proteins includes the small and heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins, kinases, and oncogene products (see Chapter 3). Many of these proteins are involved in relaying the signals that are received at the cell surface to the effector machinery within the cell interior. Their association with the membrane, therefore, brings these proteins close to the cytoplasmic sides of receptors that transmit signals from the cell exterior across the bilayer. The medical relevance of this type of membrane association is beginning to be appreciated. For example, denying certain oncogene products their lipid modifications-and hence their membrane attachment-eliminates their ability to induce tumorigenic transformation.

## Peripheral membrane proteins participate in intracellular signaling and can form a submembranous cytoskeleton

Peripheral membrane proteins attach loosely to the lipid bilayer but are not embedded within it (see p. 13). Their association with the membrane can take one of two forms.

![bo154543376c](bo154543376c.jpg)

Figure 2-9 Attachments of the cell membrane to the submembranous cytoskeleton in red blood cells. Integral membrane proteins form the bridges that link the cell membrane to the interlocking system of proteins that comprise the subcortical cytoskeleton.

First, some proteins interact via ionic interactions with phospholipid head groups. Many of these head groups are positively or negatively charged and thus can participate in salt bridges with adherent proteins.

For a second group of peripheral membrane proteins, attachment is based on the direct binding of peripheral membrane proteins to the extracellular or cytoplasmic surfaces of integral membrane proteins (see Fig. 2-5A). This form of attachment is epitomized by the cytoskeleton. For instance, the cytoplasmic surface of the erythrocyte plasma membrane is in close apposition to a dense meshwork of interlocking protein strands known as the subcortical cytoskeleton. It consists of a long, fibrillar molecule called spectrin, short polymers of the cytoskeletal protein actin, and other proteins, including ankyrin and band 4.1 (Fig. 2-9).

Two closely related isoforms of spectrin ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) form dimers, and two of these dimers assemble head to head with one another to form spectrin heterotetramers. The tail regions of spectrin bind the globular protein band 4.1, which in turn can bind to actin fibrils. Each actin fibril can associate with more than one molecule of band 4.1 so that, together, spectrin, actin, and band 4.1 assemble into an extensive interlocking matrix. The protein known as ankyrin binds to spectrin as well as to the cytoplasmic domain of band 3, the integral membrane protein responsible for transporting $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions across the erythrocyte membrane. Thus,
ankyrin is a peripheral membrane protein that anchors the spectrin-actin meshwork directly to an integral membrane protein of the erythrocyte.

The subcortical cytoskeleton provides the erythrocyte plasma membrane with strength and resilience. People who carry mutations in genes encoding components of the cytoskeleton have erythrocytes lacking the characteristic biconcave disk shape. These erythrocytes are extremely fragile and are easily torn apart by the shear stresses (see p. 415) associated with circulation through capillaries. It would appear, therefore, that the subcortical cytoskeleton forms a scaffolding of peripheral membrane proteins whose direct attachment to transmembrane proteins enhances the bilayer's structural integrity.

The subcortical cytoskeleton is not unique to erythrocytes. Numerous cell types, including neurons and epithelial cells, have submembranous meshworks that consist of proteins very similar to those first described in the erythrocyte. In addition to band 3, transmembrane proteins found in a wide variety of cells (including ion pumps, ion channels, and cell adhesion molecules) bind ankyrin and can thus serve as focal points of cytoskeletal attachment. In polarized cells (e.g., neurons and epithelial cells), the subcortical cytoskeleton appears to play a critically important role in organizing the plasma membrane into morphologically and functionally distinct domains.

## CELLULAR ORGANELLES AND THE CYTOSKELETON

## The cell is composed of discrete organelles that subserve distinct functions

When a eukaryotic cell is viewed through a light microscope, a handful of recognizable intracellular structures can be discerned. The intracellular matrix, or cytoplasm, appears grainy, suggesting the presence of components that are too small to be discriminated by this technique. With the much higher magnifications available with an electron microscope, the graininess gives way to clarity that reveals the cell interior to be remarkably complex. Even the simplest nucleated animal cell possesses a wide variety of intricate structures with specific shapes and sizes. These structures are the membrane-enclosed organelles, the functional building blocks of cells.

Figure 2-10 illustrates the interior of a typical cell. The largest organelle in this picture is the nucleus, which
houses the cell's complement of genetic information. This structure, which is visible in the light microscope, is usually round or oblong, although in some cells it displays a complex, lobulated shape. Depending on the cell type, the nucleus can range in diameter from 2 to $20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. With some exceptions, including skeletal muscle and certain specialized cells of the immune system, each animal cell has a single nucleus.

Surrounding the nucleus is a web of tubules or saccules known as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This organelle can exist in either of two forms, rough or smooth. The surfaces of the rough ER tubules are studded with ribosomes, the major sites of protein synthesis. Ribosomes can also exist free in the cytosol. The surfaces of the smooth ER, which participates in lipid synthesis, are not similarly endowed. The ER also serves as a major reservoir for calcium ions. The ER membrane is equipped with a Ca pump that uses the energy released through ATP hydrolysis to drive the transport of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen (see p. 118). This
![bo164543376c](bo164543376c.jpg)

NUCLEAR PORE COMPLEX

Figure 2-10 Ultrastructure of a typical animal cell.

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be rapidly released in response to messenger molecules and plays a major role in intracellular signaling (see p. 60).

The Golgi complex resembles a stack of pancakes. Each pancake in the stack represents a discrete, flat saccule. The number and size of the saccules in the Golgi stack vary among cell types. The Golgi complex is a processing station that participates in protein maturation and targets newly synthesized proteins to their appropriate subcellular destinations.

Perhaps the most intriguing morphological appearance belongs to the mitochondrion, which is essentially a balloon within a balloon. The outer membrane and inner membrane define two distinct internal compartments: the intermembrane space and the matrix space. The surface of the inner membrane is thrown into dramatic folds called cristae. This organelle is $\sim 0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, which is at the limit of resolution of the light microscope. The mitochondrion is the power plant of the cell, a critical manufacturer of ATP. Many cellular reactions are also catalyzed within the mitochondrion.

The cell's digestive organelle is the lysosome. This large structure frequently contains several smaller round vesicles called exosomes within its internal space.

The cytoplasm contains numerous other organelles whose shapes are not quite as distinguishing, including endosomes, peroxisomes, and transport vesicles.

Despite their diversity, all cellular organelles are constructed from the same building blocks. Each is composed of a membrane that forms the entire extent of its surface. The membranes of the subcellular organelles are what can be visualized in electron micrographs. The biochemical and physical properties of an organelle's limiting membrane dictate many of its functional properties.

## The nucleus stores, replicates, and reads the cell's genetic information

The nucleus serves as a cell's repository for its complement of chromosomal DNA. To conceive of the nucleus as simply a hermetically sealed vault for genetic information, however, is a gross oversimplification. All of the machinery necessary to maintain, to copy, and to transcribe DNA is in the nucleus, which is the focus of all of the cellular pathways that regulate gene expression and cell division. Transcriptional control is discussed in Chapter 4. The focus of this section is nuclear structure.

The nucleus is surrounded by a double membrane (see Fig. 2-10). The outer membrane is studded with ribosomes and is continuous with the membranes of the rough ER. The inner membrane is smooth and faces the intranuclear space, or nucleoplasm. The space between these concentric membranes is continuous with the lumen of the rough ER. The inner and outer nuclear membranes meet at specialized structures known as nuclear pores, which penetrate the nuclear envelope and provide a transport pathway between the cytoplasm and the nuclear interior (see p. 110). All RNA transcripts that are produced in the nucleus must pass through nuclear pores to be translated in the cytoplasm. Similarly, all the signaling molecules that influence nuclear function as well as all proteins of the nuclear interior (which
are synthesized in the cytoplasm) enter the nucleus through nuclear pores.

Nuclear pores are selective in choosing the molecules that they allow to pass. Cytoplasmic proteins destined for the nuclear interior must be endowed with a nuclear-localization sequence to gain entry. Several nuclear localization sequences have been characterized, and all seem to share common structural elements. For example, they all have short stretches of four to eight basic amino acids that can be located anywhere in the protein's sequence. Evidence implies that the ability of these signals to mediate nuclear localization can be modulated by phosphorylation, which suggests that the entry of proteins into the nucleus may be under the control of the cell's second-messenger systems.

The selectivity of the nuclear pore is surprising, considering its size. The outer diameter of the entire nuclear pore is $\sim 100 \mathrm{~nm}$, considerably larger than the proteins whose passage it controls. The nuclear pore's specificity is provided by the nuclear pore complex (NPC), an intricate matrix of protein that is distributed in a highly organized octagonal array. The NPC is composed of several hundred proteins, of at least 30 different types, that form a pore of variable internal diameter. In its resting state, the NPC forms an aqueous channel that is $\sim 9 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter, restricting the movement of any protein larger than 60 kDa . However, when it is confronted with a protein bearing a nuclear-localization signal or a messenger RNA (mRNA) transcript, the pore complex can dilate to many times this size. The structures of the proteins lining the pore appear to be uniquely flexible, perhaps permitting the cell to regulate the pore's permeability. The NPC acts as a barrier that prevents the random diffusion of integral membrane proteins between the outer and inner membranes of the nuclear envelope. However, newly synthesized membrane proteins destined for residence in the inner nuclear membrane appear to carry signals that allow them to diffuse from their sites of synthesis in the outer membrane to the inner membrane via the NPC. Thus, although the inner and outer nuclear membranes are continuous with one another at nuclear pores, their protein contents remain tightly controlled and distinct.

Between mitoses, the chromosomal DNA is present in the nucleus as densely packed heterochromatin and more loosely arrayed euchromatin. Chromatin is a complex between DNA and numerous DNA-binding proteins, which organize the chromosome into a chain of tightly folded DNA-protein assemblies called nucleosomes (see pp. 75-76). Interspersed within the nucleoplasm are round, dense nucleoli, where the transcription of ribosomal RNA and the assembly of ribosomal subunits appear to occur.

The interior surface of the inner nuclear membrane is apposed to a fibrillar protein skeleton referred to as the nuclear lamina. This meshwork, composed of proteins known as lamins, is presumably involved in providing structural support to the nuclear envelope. Mutations in the gene encoding lamin A are responsible for progeria, a genetic disease associated with rapid, premature aging. The nuclear lamina may also play a role in orchestrating nuclear reassembly. During mitosis, the nuclear envelope breaks down into small vesicles, and the contents of the nucleoplasm mix with the cytoplasm. After mitosis, these vesicles fuse with one another to regenerate the double-walled nuclear

membrane. The means by which these vesicles find one another and assemble correctly is the subject of intense study. Similarly, the mechanisms involved in maintaining the compositional discreteness of the inner and outer membranes during vesiculation and reassembly have yet to be determined. After reconstitution of the nuclear envelope, the proteins of the nucleoplasm are reimported from the cytoplasm through the nuclear pores by virtue of their nuclearlocalization sequences.

## Lysosomes digest material derived from the interior and exterior of the cell

In the course of normal daily living, cells accumulate waste. Organelles become damaged and dysfunctional. Proteins denature and aggregate. New materials are constantly being brought into the cells from the extracellular environment through the process of endocytosis (discussed below). In specialized cells of the immune system, such as macrophages, the collection of foreign materials (in the form of pathogens) from the extracellular milieu is the cellular raison dêtre. If this material were allowed to accumulate indefinitely, it would ultimately fill the cell and essentially choke it to death. Clearly, cells must have mechanisms for disposing of this waste material.

The lysosome is the cell's trash incinerator. It is filled with a broad assortment of degradative enzymes that can break down most forms of cellular debris. Proton pumps embedded within the lysosome's limiting membrane ensure that this space is an extremely acidic environment, which aids in protein hydrolysis. A rare group of inherited disorders, called lysosomal storage diseases (see Box 2-2), result from the deficiency of lysosomal enzymes that are involved in the degradation of a variety of substances.

The lysosomal membrane is specially adapted to resist digestion by the enzymes and the acid that it encapsulates, which ensures that the harsh conditions necessary for efficient degradation are effectively contained. Loss of lysosomal membrane integrity may underlie some clinically important inflammatory conditions, such as gout.

Material that has been internalized from the cell exterior by endocytosis is surrounded by the membrane of an endocytic vesicle. To deliver this material to the lysosome, the membranes of the endocytic vesicles fuse with the lysosomal membrane and discharge their cargo into the lysosomal milieu.

Intracellular structures that are destined for degradation, such as fragments of organelles, are engulfed by the lysosome in a process called autophagy. Autophagy results in the formation of membrane-enclosed structures within the lysosomal lumen; hence, the lysosome is often referred to as a multivesicular body. Autophagy allows the cell to degrade old or damaged components. Increased metabolic needs also can stimulate autophagy, allowing the cell to recycle and "burn" its own structural components to generate energy.

## The mitochondrion is the site of oxidative energy production

Oxygen-dependent ATP production-or oxidative phosphorylation-occurs in the mitochondrion. Like the
nucleus, the mitochondrion (see Fig. 2-10) is a doublemembrane structure. The inner mitochondrial membrane contains the proteins that constitute the electron transport chain, which generates pH and voltage gradients across this membrane. According to the "chemiosmotic" model (see p. 118), the inner membrane uses the energy in these gradients to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate.

The mitochondrion maintains and replicates its own genome. This circular DNA strand encodes mitochondrial transfer RNAs and (in humans) 13 mitochondrial proteins. Several copies of the mitochondrial genome are located in the inner mitochondrial matrix, which also has all of the machinery necessary to transcribe and to translate this DNA, including ribosomes. Whereas the proteins encoded in mitochondrial DNA contribute to the structure and function of the mitochondrion, they account for a relatively small fraction of total mitochondrial protein. Most mitochondrial proteins are specified by nuclear DNA and are synthesized on cytoplasmic ribosomes.

The two mitochondrial membranes enclose two distinct compartments: the intermembrane space and the inner mitochondrial matrix space. The intermembrane space lies between the two membranes; the inner mitochondrial matrix space is completely enclosed by the inner mitochondrial membrane. These compartments have completely different complements of soluble proteins, and the two membranes themselves have extremely different proteins.

In addition to playing a role in energy metabolism, the mitochondrion also serves as a reservoir for intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The mitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uniporter $\mathbf{M C U}$, together with the regulatory protein MICU, mediates the uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the mitochondrial inner membrane and into the matrix via facilitated diffusion. MCU exploits the mitochondrial membrane potential to drive the accumulation of very high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels. Elevated cytosolic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ can lead to the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from this reservoir and thereby amplify signaling processes. The mitochondrial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores are also released as a consequence of energy starvation, which leads to cell injury and death. Finally, the mitochondrion plays a central role in the process called apoptosis, or programmed cell death (see p. 1241). Certain external or internal signals can induce the cell to initiate a signaling cascade that leads ultimately to the activation of enzymes that bring about the cell's demise. One of the pathways that initiates this highly ordered form of cellular suicide depends on the participation of the mitochondrion. Apoptosis plays an extremely important role during tissue development and is also involved in the body's mechanisms for identifying and destroying cancer cells.

Mitochondriopathies-disorders of mitochondrial function-appear to play a role in several degenerative diseases (e.g., Huntington disease, dysautonomic mitochondrial myopathy).

## The cytoplasm is not amorphous but is organized by the cytoskeleton

Our discussion thus far has focused almost exclusively on the cell's membranous elements. We have treated the cytoplasm as if it were a homogeneous solution in which the organelles and vesicles carry out their functions while floating about unimpeded and at random. Rather, the cytoplasm

is enormously complex with an intricate local structure and the capacity for locomotion.

The cytoplasmic cytoskeleton is composed of protein filaments that radiate throughout the cell, serving as the beams, struts, and stays that determine cell shape and resilience. On the basis of their appearance in the electron microscope, these filaments were initially divided into several classes (Table 2-2): thick, thin, and intermediate filaments as well as microtubules. Subsequent biochemical analysis has revealed that each of these varieties is composed of distinct polypeptides and differs with respect to its formation, stability, and biological function.

## Intermediate filaments provide cells with structural support

Intermediate filaments are so named because their 8 - to $10-\mathrm{nm}$ diameters, as measured in the electron microscope, are intermediate between those of the actin thin filaments and the myosin thick filaments. As with all of the cytoskeletal filaments that we will discuss, intermediate filaments are polymers that are assembled from individual protein subunits. There is a very large variety of biochemically distinct subunit proteins that are all structurally related to one another and that derive from a single gene family. The expression of these subunit polypeptides can be cell-type specific or restricted to specific regions within a cell. Thus, vimentin is found in cells that are derived from mesenchyme, and the closely related glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is expressed exclusively in glial cells (see pp. 287288). Neurofilament proteins are present in neuronal processes. The keratins are present in epithelial cells as well as in certain epithelially derived structures. The nuclear lamins that form the structural scaffolding of the nuclear envelope are also members of the intermediate-filament family.

Intermediate-filament monomers are themselves fibrillar in structure. They assemble to form long, intercoiled dimers that in turn assemble side to side to form the tetrameric subunits. Finally, these tetrameric subunits pack together, end to end and side to side, to form intermediate filaments. Filament assembly can be regulated by the cell and in some cases appears to be governed by phosphorylation of the
subunit polypeptides. Intermediate filaments appear to radiate from and to reinforce areas of a cell subject to tensile stress. They emanate from the adhesion plaques that attach cells to their substrata. In epithelial cells, they insert at the desmosomal junctions that attach neighboring cells to one another. The toughness and resilience of the meshworks formed by these filaments is perhaps best illustrated by the keratins, the primary constituents of nails, hair, and the outer layers of skin.

## Microtubules provide structural support and provide the basis for several types of subcellular motility

Microtubules are polymers formed from heterodimers of the proteins $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tubulin (Fig. 2-11A). These heterodimers assemble head to tail, creating the circumferential wall of a microtubule, which surrounds an empty lumen. Because the tubulin heterodimers assemble with a specific orientation, microtubules are polar structures, and their ends manifest distinct biochemical properties. At one tip of the tubule, designated the plus end, tubulin heterodimers can be added to the growing polymer at three times the rate that this process occurs at the opposite minus end. The relative rates of microtubule growth and depolymerization are controlled in part by an enzymatic activity that is inherent in the tubulin dimer. Tubulin dimers bind to GTP, and in this GTP-bound state they associate more tightly with the growing ends of microtubules. Once a tubulin dimer becomes part of the microtubule, it hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP, which lowers the binding affinity of the dimer for the tubule and helps hasten disassembly. Consequently, the microtubules can undergo rapid rounds of growth and shrinkage, a behavior termed dynamic instability. Various cytosolic proteins can bind to the ends of microtubules and serve as caps that prevent assembly and disassembly, and thus stabilize the structures of the microtubules. A large and diverse family of microtubule-associated proteins appears to modulate not only the stability of the tubules but also their capacity to interact with other intracellular components.

In most cells, all of the microtubules originate from the microtubule-organizing center or centrosome. This structure generally consists of two centrioles, each of which is a small $(\sim 0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ long $\times 0.3 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter) assembly of nine triplet microtubules that are arranged obliquely along the wall of a cylinder (upper portion of Fig. 2-11B). The two centrioles in a centrosome are oriented at right angles to one another. The minus ends of all of a cell's microtubules are associated with proteins that surround the centrosome, whereas the rapidly growing plus ends radiate throughout the cytoplasm in a star-like arrangement ("astral" microtubules).

Microtubules participate in a multitude of cellular functions and structures. For example, microtubules project down the axon of neurons. Microtubules also provide the framework for the lacy membranes of the ER and Golgi complex. Disruption of microtubules causes these organelles to undergo dramatic morphological rearrangements and vesicularization. Microtubules also play a central role in cell division. Early in mitosis, the centrioles that make up the centrosomes replicate, forming two centrosomes at opposite poles of the dividing nucleus. Emanating from these

Figure 2-11 Microtubules. A, Heterodimers of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ tubulin form long protofilaments, 13 of which surround the hollow core of a microtubule. The microtubule grows more rapidly at its plus end. The molecular motor dynein moves along the microtubule in the plus-to-minus direction, whereas the molecular motor kinesin moves in the opposite direction. ATP is the fuel for each of these motors. B, The microtubules originate from a microtubule-organizing center or centrosome, which generally consists of two centrioles (green cylinders). C, A motile cilium can actively bend as its microtubules slide past each other. The molecular motor dynein produces this motion, fueled by ATP.

centrosomes are the microtubules that form the spindle fibers, which in turn align the chromosomes (lower portion of Fig. 2-11B). Their coordinated growth and dissolution at either side of the chromosomes may provide the force for separating the genetic material during the anaphase of mitosis. A pair of centrioles remains with each daughter cell.

The architectural and mechanical capacities of microtubules are perhaps best illustrated by their role in motility. An electron microscopic cross section of a cilium demonstrates the elegance, symmetry, and intricacy of this structure (see Fig. 2-11C). Every cilium arises out of its own basal body, which is essentially a centriole that is situated at the ciliary root. Cilia come in two varieties-motile and nonmotile. Whereas motile cilia move and develop force, generating directional fluid flow in a number of organs, nonmotile cilia do not move on their own and instead serve sensory functions. We discuss motile cilia here and nonmotile cilia on page 43.

Cilia are present on the surfaces of many types of epithelial cells, including those that line the larger pulmonary airways (see p. 597). In the airway epithelial cells, their oarlike beating motions help propel foreign bodies and pathogens toward their ultimate expulsion at the pharynx. At the center of a cilium is a structure called the axoneme, which is composed of a precisely defined " $9+2$ " array of microtubules. Each of the 9 (which are also called outer tubules) consists of a complete microtubule with 13 tubulin monomers in cross section (the A tubule) to which is fused an incomplete microtubule with 11 tubulin monomers in cross section (the B tubule). Each of the 2, which lie at the core of the cilium, is a complete microtubule. This entire $9+2$ structure runs the entire length of the cilium. The same array forms the core of a flagellum, the serpentine motions of which propel sperm cells (see Fig. 56-1).

Radial spokes connect the outer tubules to the central pair, and outer tubules attach to their neighbors by two types of linkages. One is composed of the protein dynein, which acts as a molecular motor to power ciliary and flagellar motions. (5) N2-4 Dynein is an ATPase that converts the energy released through ATP hydrolysis into a conformational change that produces a bending motion. Because dynein attached to one outer tubule interacts with a neighboring outer tubule, this bending of the dynein molecule causes the adjacent outer tubules to slide past one another. It is this sliding-filament motion that gives rise to the coordinated movements of the entire structure. To some extent, this coordination is accomplished through the action of the second linkage protein, called nexin. The nexin arms restrict the extent to which neighboring outer tubules can move with respect to each other and thus prevent the dynein motor from driving the dissolution of the entire complex.

The utility of the dynein motor protein is not restricted to its function in cilia and flagella. Cytoplasmic dynein, which is a close relative of the motor molecule found in cilia, and a second family of motor proteins called kinesins provide the force necessary to move membrane-bound organelles through the cytoplasm along microtubular tracks (see Fig. 2-11A). The ability of vesicular organelles to move rapidly along microtubules was first noted in neurons, in which vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins must be transported over extremely long distances from the cell body to
the axon tip. Rather than trust this critical process to the vagaries of slow, nondirected diffusion, the neuron makes use of a kinesin motor, which links a vesicle to a microtubule. Kinesins hydrolyze ATP and, like dynein, convert this energy into mechanical transitions that cause kinesins to "walk" along the microtubule. Kinesins will move only along microtubules and thereby transport their vesicle cargoes in the minus-to-plus direction (orthograde). Thus, in neurons, kinesin-bound vesicles move from the microtubular minus ends, originating at the centrosome in the cell body, toward the plus ends in the axons. This direction of motion is referred to as anterograde fast axonal transport. Cytoplasmic dynein moves in the plus-to-minus direction (retrograde).

The motor-driven movement of cellular organelles along microtubular tracks is not unique to neurons. This process, involving both kinesins and cytoplasmic dynein, appears to occur in almost every cell and may control the majority of subcellular vesicular traffic.

## Thin filaments (actin) and thick filaments (myosin) are present in almost every cell type

Thin filaments, also called microfilaments, are 5 to 8 nm in diameter. They are helical polymers composed of a single polypeptide called globular actin or G-actin. Thin filaments are functionally similar to microtubules in two respects: (1) the actin polymers are polar and grow at different rates at their two ends, and (2) actin binds and then hydrolyzes a nucleotide. However, whereas tubulin binds GTP and then hydrolyzes it to GDP, actin binds ATP and then hydrolyzes it to ADP. After G-actin binds ATP, it may interact with another ATP-bound monomer to form an unstable dimer (Fig. 2-12A). Adding a third ATP-bound monomer, however, yields a stable trimer that serves as a nucleus for assembly of the polymer of fibrous actin or F-actin. Once it is part of F-actin, the actin monomer hydrolyzes its bound ATP, retaining the ADP and releasing the inorganic phosphate. The ADP-bound actin monomer is more likely to disengage itself from its neighbors, just as GDP-bound tubulin dimers are more likely to disassemble from tubulin (see p. 23). Even though the length of the F-actin filament may remain more or less constant, the polymer may continually grow at its plus end but disassemble at its minus end (see Fig. 2-12B). This "treadmilling" requires the continuous input of energy (i.e., hydrolysis of ATP) and illustrates the unique dynamic properties of actin filament elongation and disassembly.

Thick filaments are composed of dimers of a remarkable force-generating protein called myosin. All myosin molecules have helical tails and globular head groups that hydrolyze ATP and act as motors to move along an actin filament. The energy liberated by ATP hydrolysis is invested in bending the myosin molecule around a pivot point called the hinge region, which marks the junction between the globular and tail regions. By means of this bending, myosin, like the dynein and kinesin that interact with microtubules, acts as a molecular motor that converts chemical into mechanical energy. 6 N2-4

In muscle, the myosin molecules are in the myosin II subfamily and exist as dimers with their long tails intertwined (Fig. 2-13A). In muscle, each of the two myosin II

heads binds two additional protein subunits referred to as myosin light chains. Nonmuscle cells, in addition to myosin II, may have a variety of other, smaller myosin molecules. These other myosins, the most widely studied of which is myosin I, have shorter tails and, at least in some cases, act as molecular motors that move vesicles along actin filaments.

In muscle, the myosin II dimers stack as antiparallel arrays to form a bipolar structure with a central region that contains only tails (see Fig. 2-13A). The ends of the thick filament contain the heads that bend toward the filament's central region. The pivoting action of the myosin head groups drags the neighboring thin filament (see Fig. 2-13B), which includes other molecules besides actin. This slidingfilament phenomenon underlies muscle contraction and force generation (see Fig. 2-13C).

Actin as well as an ever-growing list of myosin isoforms is present in essentially every cell type. The functions of these proteins are easy to imagine in some cases and are less obvious in many others. Many cells, including all of the fibroblast-like cells, possess actin filaments that are arranged in stress fibers. These linear arrays of fibers interconnect adhesion plaques to one another and to interior structures in the cell. They orient themselves along lines of tension and can, in turn, exert contractile force on the substratum that underlies the cell. Stress-fiber contractions may be involved in the macroscopic contractions that are associated with wound healing. Frequently, actin filaments in nonmuscle cells are held together in bundles by cross-linking proteins. Numerous classes of cross-linking proteins have been identified, several of which can respond to physiological changes
by either stabilizing or severing filaments and filament bundles.

In motile cells, such as fibroblasts and macrophages, arrays of actin-myosin filaments are responsible for cell locomotion. Assembly of actin filaments can drive the directional extension of the cell membrane at the cell's leading edge, creating structures known as lamellipodia. A $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ stimulated myosin light chain kinase regulates the assembly of myosin and actin filaments, which produce contractile force and retraction at the cell's trailing edge. To generate directional motion, these cytoskeletal elements must be able to form transient traction-generating connections to the cell's substratum. (5) N2-5 These connections are established through integrins (see p. 17).

In contrast to fibroblasts and circulating cells of the immune system, cells such as neurons and epithelial cells generally do not move much after their differentiation is complete. Despite this lack of movement, however, these cells are equipped with remarkably intricate networks of actin and myosin filaments. In some cases, these cytoskeletal elements permit the cell to extend processes to distant locations. This is the case in neurons, in which the growth and migration of axons during development or regeneration of the nervous system bear a striking morphological resemblance to the crawling of free-living amoebae. The tip of a growing axon, known as a growth cone, is richly endowed with contractile fibers and is capable of the same types of crawling motions that characterize motile cells.

In epithelial cells, the role of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton is somewhat less obvious but still important to normal physiological function. The microvilli at the apical surfaces

It should be noted that at least in some cases, the interactions that contribute to cellular motility are geometrically and biochemically quite distinct from those which underlie muscle contraction. For example, the amoebic cells of the bread mold Dictyostelium discoideum are able to continue crawling despite the elimination-by genetic deletion-of all of their myosin. Although motility in these altered cells is not normal, that it persists at all provides ample proof that the paradigms that apply to smooth and striated muscle are by no means the only schemes that nature has devised to generate actin fila-ment-based motion.

of many epithelial-cell types (e.g., those that line the renal proximal tubule and the small intestine) are supported by an intricate scaffolding of actin filaments that form their cores (Fig. 2-14). This bundle of actin fibers is held together and anchored to the overlying plasma membrane by a variety of cross-linking proteins, including various myosin isoforms. The roots of the microvillar actin filament bundles emerge from the bases of the microvilli into a dense meshwork of cytoskeletal filaments known as the terminal web. Included among the components of the terminal web are fodrin (the nonerythroid homolog of spectrin) and myosin. The myosin in the terminal web interconnects the actin filaments of neighboring microvilli. In addition, this actin-myosin complex is capable of generating contractile movements that can alter the spatial relationships among microvilli.

Actin and myosin filaments also form an adhesion belt that encircles the cytoplasmic surface of the epithelial plasma membrane at the level of the tight junctions that interconnect neighboring cells. These adhesion belts are apparently capable of contraction and thus cause epithelial cells that normally form a continuous sheet to pull away from one another, temporarily loosening tight junctions and creating direct passages that connect the luminal space to the ECF compartment.

Actin and myosin also participate in processes common to most if not all cell types. The process of cytokinesis, in which the cytoplasm of a dividing cell physically separates into two daughter cells, is driven by actin and myosin

filaments. Beneath the cleavage furrow that forms in the membrane of the dividing cell is a contractile ring of actin and myosin filaments. Contraction of this ring deepens the cleavage furrow; this invagination ultimately severs the cell and produces the two progeny. 9 N2-6

## SYNTHESIS AND RECYCLING OF MEMBRANE PROTEINS

## Secretory and membrane proteins are synthesized in association with the rough ER

Transmembrane proteins are composed of hydrophobic domains that are embedded within the phospholipid bilayer and hydrophilic domains that are exposed at the intracellular and extracellular surfaces (see pp. 13-15). These proteins do not "flip" through the membrane. How, then, do intrinsic membrane proteins overcome the enormous energetic barriers that should logically prevent them from getting inserted into the membrane in the first place?

The cell has developed several schemes to address this problem. Mammalian cells have at least three different membrane insertion pathways, each associated with specific organelles. The first two are mechanisms for inserting membrane proteins into peroxisomes and mitochondria (see pp. 30-32). The third mechanism inserts membrane proteins destined for delivery to the plasma membrane and to the membranes of organelles (the endomembranous system) other than the peroxisome and mitochondrion. This same mechanism is involved in the biogenesis of essentially all proteins that mammalian cells secrete and is the focus of the following discussion.

The critical work in this field centered on studies of the rough ER. The membrane of the rough ER (see pp. 20-21) is notable for the presence of numerous ribosomes that are bound to its cytosol-facing surface. Although all nucleated mammalian cells have at least some rough ER, cells that produce large quantities of secretory proteins-such as the exocrine cells of the pancreas, which function as factories for digestive enzymes (see pp. 879-881)—are endowed with an abundance of rough ER. Roughly half of the cytoplasmic space in an exocrine pancreatic acinar cell is occupied by rough ER.

In early experiments exploring cell-fractionation techniques, membranes that were derived from the rough ER were separated from the other membranous and cytoplasmic components of pancreatic acinar cells. The mRNAs associated with rough ER membranes were isolated and the proteins they encoded were synthesized by in vitro translation. Analysis of the resultant polypeptides revealed that they included the cell's entire repertoire of secretory proteins. It is now appreciated that the mRNA associated with the ER also encodes the cell's entire repertoire of membrane proteins, with the exception of those destined for either the peroxisome or the mitochondrion. When the same experiment was performed with mRNAs isolated from ribosomes that are freely distributed throughout the cytoplasm, the products were not secretory proteins but rather the soluble cytosolic proteins. Later work showed that the ribosomes bound to the ER are biochemically identical to and in equilibrium with those that are free in the cytosol. Therefore, a ribosome's
subcellular localization-that is, whether it is free in the cytosol or bound to the rough ER-is somehow dictated by the mRNA that the ribosome is currently translating. A ribosome that is involved in assembling a secretory or membrane protein will associate with the membrane of the rough ER, whereas the same ribosome will be free in the cytosol when it is producing cytosolic proteins. Clearly, some localization signal that resides in the mRNA or in the protein that is being synthesized must tell the ribosome what kind of protein is being produced and where in the cell that production should occur.

The nature of this signal was discovered in 1972 during studies of the biosynthesis of immunoglobulin light chains. Light chains synthesized in vitro, in the absence of rough ER membranes, have a 15 -amino-acid extension at their amino terminus that is absent from the same light chains synthesized and secreted in vivo by B lymphocytes. Similar aminoterminal extensions are present on most secretory or membrane proteins but never on the soluble proteins of the cytosol. Although they vary in length and composition, these extensions are usually $\alpha$-helical and are composed of strings of hydrophobic acids that are often preceded by short stretches of basic residues. These signal sequences, as they have come to be known, serve as the localization devices discussed above. As it emerges from a ribosome and is freely floating in the cytosol, the signal sequence of a nascent protein (Fig. 2-15, stage 1) targets the ribosome-mRNA complex to the surface of the rough ER where the protein's biogenesis will be completed. Ribosome-mRNA complexes that lack a signal sequence complete the translation of the mRNA-which encodes neither secretory nor membrane proteins-without attaching to the rough ER. For his work on signal sequences, Günter Blobel received the 1999 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. 9 N2-7

Why does the cell bother to segregate the synthesis of different protein populations to different cellular locales? Proteins that are destined either to reside in a membrane or to undergo secretion are inserted into or across the membrane of the rough ER at the same time that they are translated; this is called cotranslational translocation. As the nascent polypeptide chain emerges from the ribosome, it traverses the rough ER membrane and ultimately appears at the ER's luminal face. There, an enzyme cleaves the aminoterminal signal sequence while the protein is still being translocated. This is why proteins that are synthesized in vitro in the absence of membranes are longer than the same proteins that are produced by intact cells.

## Simultaneous protein synthesis and translocation through the rough ER membrane requires machinery for signal recognition and protein translocation

The information embodied within a signal sequence explains how a nascent protein can direct a cell to complete that protein's translation at the time of translocation in the rough ER. However, the signal sequence by itself is not sufficient. Two critical pieces of targeting machinery are also necessary to direct the ribosome and its attached nascent peptide to the ER. The first is a ribonucleoprotein complex called the signal recognition particle (SRP), which binds to the signal sequence on the nascent peptide (see Fig. 2-15, stage 2). The

## N2-6 Other Roles of Actin and Myosin

## Contributed by Michael Caplan

In addition to having the functions discussed in the text, actin and myosin may play important roles in other processes. Actin filaments and various newly discovered isoforms of myosin may be involved in the shuttling of intracellular cargoes in much the same way that microtubules and their associated motor proteins participate in this function. Certain types of myosin appear to serve as motors that drive the movements of vesicles and other organelles along tracks composed of actin filaments. The precise role and relative importance of these movements in the physiology of the cell has yet to be fully elucidated. Despite this uncertainty, it is clear that the actin and myosin cytoskeleton subserves a multitude of functions, ranging from its classical role in the macroscopic contractions of skeletal muscles to its contributions to motility at subcellular scales.

Figure 2-15 Synthesis and translocation of a secretory protein.

SRP is composed of seven distinct polypeptides and a short strand of RNA. When the SRP binds to a nascent chain, it also binds a GTP molecule. The second vital piece of targeting machinery is a transmembrane component of the rough ER, the SRP receptor, also called the docking protein. Interaction between a signal sequence and the SRP, and subsequently between the SRP-nascent peptide-ribosome complex and the docking protein, directs the nascent chain to the rough ER's translocation apparatus.

Because the membrane of the rough ER has a finite number of docking sites, the cell must coordinate the synthesis of secretory and membrane proteins with the availability of docking sites. If all docking sites were occupied, and if the synthesis of nascent secretory and membrane proteins were allowed to continue unabated, these nascent peptides would be synthesized entirely in the cytoplasm on free ribosomes. As a consequence, these newly synthesized proteins would never arrive at their proper destination. The SRP serves as a regulatory system that matches the rate of synthesis of secretory and membrane proteins to the number of unoccupied translocation sites. By associating with a nascent signal sequence, the SRP causes the ribosome to halt further protein synthesis (see Fig. 2-15, stage 2). This state of translation arrest persists until the SRP-nascent peptide-ribosome complex finds an unoccupied docking protein with which to interact. Thus, SRP prevents secretory and membrane proteins from being translated until their cotranslational translocation can be ensured. Because SRP interacts only with nascent chains that bear signal sequences, ribosomes that synthesize proteins destined for release into the cytosol never associate with SRP, and their translation is never arrested. Thus, SRP serves as a highly specific spatial and temporal sorting machine, guaranteeing the accurate and efficient targeting of secretory and membrane proteins.

How does the cell terminate the translation arrest of the SRP-nascent peptide-ribosome complex? When this
complex interacts with a docking protein (see Fig. 2-15, stage 3), one of the SRP's subunits hydrolyzes the previously bound GTP, thereby releasing the SRP from a successfully targeted nascent peptide-ribosome complex. In this way, the docking protein informs the SRP that its mission has been accomplished and it can return to the cytosol to find another ribosome with a signal peptide. A second GTP hydrolysis step transfers the nascent peptide from the docking protein to the actual translocation tunnel complex. GTP hydrolysis is a common event and is involved in the transmission of numerous cellular messages (see pp. 53 and 56). In this case, the two separate instances of GTP hydrolysis serve a qualitycontrol function, because the activation of the GTPase activity depends on the delivery of the nascent peptide to the appropriate component in the translocation apparatus.

Adjacent to the docking protein in the membrane of the rough ER is a protein translocator termed a translocon (see Fig. 2-15, stage 3), which contains a tunnel through which the nascent protein will pass across the rough ER membrane. It appears that delivery of a nascent chain to the translocon causes the entrance of the translocator's tunnel, which is normally closed, to open. This opening of the translocon also allows the flow of small ions. The electrical current carried by these ions can be measured by the patch-clamp technique (see p. 154). By "gating" the translocon so that it opens only when it is occupied by a nascent protein, the cell keeps the tunnel's entrance closed when it is not in use. This gating prevents the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stored in the ER from leaking into the cytoplasm.

Because the tunnel of the translocon is an aqueous pore, the nascent secretory or membrane protein does not come into contact with the hydrophobic core of the ER membrane's lipid bilayer during cotranslational translocation. Thus, this tunnel allows hydrophilic proteins to cross the membrane. As translation and translocation continue and the nascent protein enters the lumen of the rough ER, an enzyme called signal peptidase cleaves the signal peptide,

which remains in the membrane of the rough ER (see Fig. 2-15, stage 4). Meanwhile, translation and translocation of the protein continue (see Fig. 2-15, stage 5). In the case of secretory proteins (i.e., not membrane proteins), the peptide translocates completely through the membrane. The ribosome releases the complete protein into the lumen of the rough ER and then dissociates from the rough ER (see Fig. 2-15, stage 6).

## Proper insertion of membrane proteins requires start- and stop-transfer sequences

Unlike soluble proteins, nascent membrane proteins do not translocate completely through the membrane of the rough ER (Fig. 2-16A, stage 1). The hydrophobic amino-acid residues that will ultimately become the transmembrane segment of a membrane protein also function as a stop-transfer sequence (see Fig. 2-16A, stage 2). When a stop-transfer sequence emerges from a ribosome, it causes the translocon to open laterally, releasing the hydrophobic membranespanning segment into the hospitable environment of the rough ER membrane's hydrophobic core (see Fig. 2-16A, stage 3). In the meantime, the ribosomal machinery continues to translate the rest of the nascent protein. If the signal peptidase cleaves the amino terminus at this time, the end result is a protein with a single transmembrane segment, with the amino terminus in the lumen of the rough ER and the carboxyl terminus in the cytoplasm (see Fig. 2-16A, stage 4).

There is another way of generating a protein with a single transmembrane segment. In this case, the protein lacks a signal sequence at the N terminus but instead hassomewhere in the middle of the nascent peptide-a bifunctional sequence that serves both as a signal sequence that binds SRP and as a hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment. This special sequence is called an internal starttransfer sequence. The SRP binds to the internal starttransfer sequence and brings the nascent protein to the rough ER, where the internal start-transfer sequence binds to the translocon in such a way that the more positively charged residues that flank the start-transfer sequence face the cytosol. Because these positively charged flanking residues can either precede or follow the hydrophobic residues of the internal start-transfer sequence, either the carboxyl (C) terminus or the N terminus can end up in the cytosol. If the more positively charged flanking residues are at the carboxyl-terminal end of the internal start-transfer sequence (see Fig. 2-16B), the protein will be oriented with its carboxyl terminus in the cytosol. If the more positively charged flanking residues are at the amino-terminal end of the internal
start-transfer sequence (see Fig. 2-16C), the protein will be oriented with its amino terminus in the cytosol.

By alternating both stop-transfer sequences (see Fig. 2-16A) and internal start-transfer sequences (see Fig. 2-16B, C), the cell can fabricate membrane proteins that span the membrane more than once. Figure 2-16D shows how the cell could synthesize a multispanning protein with its N terminus in the cytosol. The process starts just as in Figure 2-16C, as the translation machinery binds to the rough ER (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 1) and the protein's first internal start-transfer sequence inserts into the translocon (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 2). However, when the first stop-transfer sequence reaches the translocon (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 3), the translocon disassembles, releasing the protein's first two membrane-spanning segments into the membrane of the rough ER. Note that the first membrane-spanning segment is the internal starttransfer sequence and the second is the stop-transfer sequence. In the meantime, an SRP binds to the second internal start-transfer sequence (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 4) and directs it to the rough ER (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 5) so that cotranslational translocation can once again continue (see Fig. 2-16D, stage 6). If there are no further stop-transfer sequences, the result will be a protein with three membranespanning segments.

Several points from the preceding discussion deserve special emphasis. First, translocation through the ER membrane can occur only cotranslationally. If a secretory or membrane protein were synthesized completely on a cytoplasmic ribosome, it would be unable to interact with the translocation machinery and consequently would not be inserted across or into the bilayer. As discussed below, this is not true for the insertion of either peroxisomal or mitochondrial proteins. Second, once a signal sequence emerges from a ribosome, there is only a brief period during which it is competent to mediate the ribosome's association with the ER and to initiate translocation. This time constraint is presumably due to the tendency of nascent polypeptide chains to begin to fold and acquire tertiary structure very soon after exiting the ribosome. This folding quickly buries hydrophobic residues of a signal sequence so that they cannot be recognized by the translocation machinery. Third, because the translocation channel appears to be fairly narrow, the nascent protein cannot begin to acquire tertiary structure until after it has exited at the ER's luminal face. Thus, the peptide must enter the translocation tunnel as a thin thread immediately after emerging from the ribosome. These facts explain why translocation is cotranslational. In systems in which post-translational translocation occurs (e.g., peroxisomes and mitochondria), special adaptations keep the

Figure 2-16 Synthesis of integral membrane proteins. A, Like a secreted protein, the membrane protein can have a cleavable signal sequence. In addition, it has a stop-transfer sequence that remains in the membrane as a membrane-spanning segment. B, The emerging protein lacks a signal sequence but instead has an internal start-transfer sequence, which is a bifunctional sequence that serves both as a signal sequence that binds SRPs and as a hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment. In this example, the positively charged region flanking the internal start-transfer sequence is on the carboxyl (C)-terminal end of the internal starttransfer sequence.

newly synthesized protein in an unfolded state until its translocation can be consummated.

Finally, because the protein cannot flip once it is in the membrane, the scheme just outlined results in proteins that are inserted into the rough ER membrane in their final or "mature" topology. The number and location of a membrane protein's transmembrane segments, as well as its cytoplasmic and extracytoplasmic loops, are entirely determined during the course of its cotranslational insertion into the ER membrane. The order in which signal, internal start-transfer, and stop-transfer sequences appear in a membrane protein's primary structure completely determines how that protein will be arrayed across whatever membrane it ultimately comes to occupy.

## Newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins undergo post-translational modification and folding in the lumen of the rough ER

As a newly synthesized secretory or membrane protein exits the tunnel of the translocon and enters the lumen of the rough ER, it may undergo a series of post-translational modifications that will help it to acquire its mature conformation. The first alteration, as discussed above, is cleavage of the signal sequence (if present) and is accomplished very soon after the signal sequence has completed its translocation. Other covalent modifications that occur as translocation continues include glycosylation and formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Glycosylation refers here to the enzymatic, en-bloc coupling of preassembled, branched oligosaccharide chains that contain 14 sugar molecules (Fig. 2-17A) to asparagine residues that appear in the sequence Asn-X-Ser or Asn-X-Thr ( X can be any amino acid except proline). These N-linked sugars ( N is the single-letter amino-acid code for asparagine) will go on to be extensively modified as the protein passes through other organellar compartments. The addition of sugar groups to proteins can serve numerous functions, which include increasing the
protein's stability and endowing it with specific antigenic, adhesive, or receptor properties.

Disulfide bond formation is catalyzed by protein disulfide isomerase, an enzyme that is retained in the ER lumen through noncovalent interactions with ER membrane proteins. Because the cytoplasm is a reducing environment, disulfide bonds can form only between proteins or protein domains that have been removed from the cytosolic compartment through translocation to the ER's interior. Other, more specialized modifications also take place in the lumen of the rough ER. For example, the ER contains the enzymes responsible for the hydroxylation of the proline residues that are present in newly synthesized collagen chains.

The ER also catalyzes the formation of GPI linkages to membrane proteins (see Fig. 2-17B). GPI-linked proteins are synthesized as transmembrane polypeptides, with a typical membrane-spanning region. Shortly after their translation, however, their lumen-facing domains are cleaved from the membrane-spanning segments and covalently transferred to the GPI phospholipid. They retain this structure and orientation throughout the remainder of their journey to the cell surface. A defect in the synthesis of GPI-linked proteins underlies the human disease paroxysmal nocturnal hematuria (Box 2-1).

Perhaps the most important maturational process for a nascent chain emerging into the ER lumen is the acquisition of tertiary structure. The folding of a secretory or membrane protein is determined during and immediately after its cotranslational translocation. The progress of protein folding influences-and is influenced by-the addition of sugar residues and the formation of disulfide bridges. Proteins fold into conformations that minimize their overall free energies. Their extramembranous surfaces are composed of hydrophilic residues that interact easily with the aqueous solvent. Hydrophobic residues are hidden in internal globular domains where they can be effectively isolated from contact with water or charged molecules. Left to its own devices, a linear strand of denatured protein will spontaneously fold to

# BOX 2-1 Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hematuria 

The list of proteins embedded in the plasma membrane via a GPI linkage is remarkably long and ever growing. In red blood cells, the inventory of GPI-linked proteins includes a pair of polypeptides, decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and CD59, which help protect the erythrocytes from being accidentally injured by constituents of the immune system. One of the mechanisms that the immune system uses to rid the body of invading bacteria involves the activation of the complement cascade. Complement is a complex collection of proteins that circulate in the blood plasma. The complement system recognizes antibodies that are bound to the surface of a bacterium or polysaccharides in the bacterial membrane. This recognition initiates a cascade of enzymatic cleavages that results in the assembly of a subset of complement proteins to form the membrane attack complex, which inserts itself into the membrane of the target organism and forms a large pore that allows water to rush in (see pp. 109-110). The target bacterium swells and undergoes osmotic lysis. Unfortunately, the complement system's lethal efficiency is not matched by its capacity to discriminate between genuine targets and normal host cells. Consequently, almost every cell type in the body is equipped with surface proteins that guard against a misdirected complement attack.

DAF and CD59 are two such proteins that interfere with distinct steps in the complement activation pathway. Because GPI linkages couple both proteins to the membrane, any dysfunction of the enzymes that participate in the transfer of GPI-linked proteins from their transmembrane precursors to their GPI tails in the ER would interfere with the delivery of DAF and CD59 to their sites of functional residence at the cell surface. One of the proteins that participates in the synthesis of the GPI anchor is a sugar transferase encoded by the phosphatidylinositol glycan class A (PIG-A) gene. This gene is located on the X chromosome.

Because every cell has only one working copy of the $X$ chromosome (although female cells are genetically XX, one of the two $X$ chromosomes is inactivated in every cell), if a spontaneous mutation occurs in the PIG-A gene in a particular cell, that cell and all of its progeny will lose the ability to synthesize GPI-linked proteins.

In paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (i.e., the appearance of hemoglobin in the urine at night, with a sharp onset), a spontaneous mutation occurs in the PIG-A gene in just one of the many precursor cells that give rise to erythrocytes. All of the erythrocytes that arise from this particular precursor, therefore, are deficient in GPI-linked protein synthesis. Consequently, these cells lack DAF and CD59 expression and are susceptible to complement attack and lysis. For reasons that are largely unknown, the complement system is somewhat more active during sleep, so the hemolysis (lysis of erythrocytes) occurs more frequently at night in these patients. Some of the hemoglobin released by this lysis is excreted in the urine.

Because the PIG-A gene product is required for the synthesis of all GPI-linked proteins, the plasma membranes of affected red blood cells in patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are missing a number of different proteins that are found in the surface membranes of their normal counterparts. It is the lack of DAF and CD59, however, that renders the cells vulnerable to complement-mediated killing and that creates the symptoms of the disease. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is an uncommon disease. Because it is the result of an acquired mutation, it is much more likely to occur in people of middle age than in children. Patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria are likely to become anemic and can suffer life-threatening disorders of clotting and bone marrow function. It is a chronic condition, however, and more than half of patients survive at least 15 years after diagnosis.
form a structure that reflects these thermodynamic considerations. Thus, protein folding requires no catalysis and can occur without help from any cellular machinery. However, the cell is not content to allow protein folding to follow a random course and instead orchestrates the process through the actions of molecular chaperones.

The chaperones constitute a large class of ATP-hydrolyzing proteins that appear to participate in a wide variety of polypeptide-folding phenomena, including the initial folding of newly synthesized proteins as well as the refolding of proteins whose tertiary structures have been damaged by exposure to high temperature (i.e., heat shock) or other denaturing conditions. Chaperones bind to unfolded protein chains and stabilize them in an unfolded conformation, thus preventing them from spontaneously folding into what might be an energetically favorable but biologically useless arrangement. Using energy that is provided through ATP hydrolysis, the chaperones sequentially release domains of unfolded proteins and thus allow them to fold in an ordered fashion. An excess of unfolded or misfolded proteins causes ER stress, triggering the unfolded protein response. (5) N2-8 Distinct subclasses of chaperones are present in several cell compartments, including the cytoplasm, the mitochondrion, and the lumen of the rough ER. Newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins interact with ER chaperones as they exit from the tunnel of the
translocon and subsequently disengage from the chaperones to assume their mature tertiary structure.

The acquisition of tertiary structure is followed quickly by the acquisition of quaternary structure. As noted above in this chapter, many membrane proteins assemble into oligomeric complexes in which several identical or distinct polypeptides interact with one another to form a macromolecular structure. Assembly of these multimers generally occurs in the ER. It is unknown whether the oligomeric assembly process occurs entirely spontaneously or if, like folding, it is orchestrated by specialized cellular mechanisms. Cells clearly go to great trouble to ensure that proteins inserted into or across their ER membranes are appropriately folded and oligomerized before allowing them to continue with their postsynthetic processing. As discussed below, proteins destined for secretion from the cell or for residence in plasma or organellar membranes depart the ER for further processing in the membranous stacks of the Golgi complex. This departure is entirely contingent on successful completion of the protein folding and assembly operations.

Misfolded or unassembled proteins are retained in the ER and ultimately degraded. The ER chaperone proteins play a critical role both in identifying proteins with incorrect tertiary or quaternary structures and in actively preventing their egress to the Golgi complex. Proteins that have not folded or assembled correctly are destroyed through

a process known as ERAD (endoplasmic reticulumassociated degradation). The sequential covalent addition of ubiquitin monomers results in the formation of a branchedchain ubiquitin polymer that marks these proteins for destruction. Ubiquitin is a small protein of 76 amino-acid residues. The process known as retrotranslocation removes ubiquitin-tagged proteins from the ER membrane, and a large cytoplasmic complex of proteolytic enzymes-the proteasome-degrades the ubiquitinated proteins.

## Secretory and membrane proteins follow the secretory pathway through the cell

The rough ER is the common point of origin for the cell's secretory and membrane proteins. Most of these proteins are not retained in the rough ER but depart for distribution to their sites of ultimate functional residence throughout the cell. As is true for their arrival in the rough ER, the departure of these proteins is a highly organized and regimented affair. In fact, the rough ER is the first station along the secretory pathway, which is the route followed (at least in part) by all secretory and membrane proteins as they undergo their post-translational modifications (Fig. 2-18).

The elucidation of the secretory pathway occurred in the 1960s, mainly in the laboratory of George Palade. For his contribution, Palade was awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (T) N2-9 This work also exploited the unique properties of pancreatic acinar cells to illuminate the central features of the biogenesis of secretory proteins. Because $\sim 95 \%$ of the protein that is synthesized by pancreatic acinar cells is digestive enzymes destined for secretion
(see p. 882), when these cells are fed radioactively labeled amino acids, the majority of these tracer molecules are incorporated into secretory polypeptides. Within a few minutes after the tracer is added, most of the label is associated with a specialized subregion of the rough ER. Known as transitional zones, these membranous saccules are ribosome studded on one surface and smooth on the opposite face (see Fig. 2-18). The smooth side is directly apposed to one pole of the pancake-like membrane stacks (or cisternae) of the Golgi complex. Smooth-surfaced carrier vesicles crowd the narrow moat of cytoplasm that separates the transitional zone from the Golgi. These vesicles "pinch off" from the transitional zone and fuse with a Golgi stack. From this first or cis-Golgi stack, carrier vesicles ferry the newly synthesized proteins sequentially and vectorially through each Golgi stack, ultimately delivering them to the trans-most saccule of the Golgi. Finally, the newly synthesized secretory proteins appear in secretory vesicles (also called secretory granules in many tissues).

The journey from the rough ER to the secretory vesicle takes $\sim 45$ minutes in pancreatic acinar cells and requires the expenditure of metabolic energy. Each nucleated eukaryotic cell possesses a secretory pathway that shares this same general outline, although the specific features reflect the cell's particular function. The secretory pathway of the pancreatic acinar cell, for example, is specially adapted to accommodate the controlled secretion of protein via the so-called regulated pathway. Instead of being released from the cell continuously as they are produced, newly synthesized secretory proteins are held in specialized secretory vesicles that serve as an intracellular storage depot. This type of storage occurs in

several cells, including those of endocrine and exocrine secretory tissues, and neurons. When the cells receive the requisite message, the storage vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, sometime at a specialized structure called a porosome, in a process known as exocytosis. (○) N2-10 The vesicles then dump their contents into the extracellular space. In the case of the pancreatic acinar cells, the enzymes are secreted into the pancreatic ductules and then make their way to the site of digestion in the duodenum (see p. 881).

Most cell types, however, deliver newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins to the cell surface in a continuous and unregulated fashion, which is referred to as the constitutive pathway. Specialized cells that have the capacity for regulated delivery also send an important subset of their secretory and membrane protein synthetic products to the cell surface constitutively. The regulated and constitutive secretory pathways are identical except for the final station of the Golgi complex. At this point, the "regulated" proteins divert to the specialized secretory vesicles described in the previous paragraph. The "constitutive" proteins, at the transmost cisterna of the Golgi complex, sort into other secretory vesicles, which move directly to the cell surface. There, the constitutive membrane proteins are delivered to the plasma membrane, and the constitutive secretory proteins are immediately exocytosed.

This section has provided a broad overview of the secretory pathway. In the following sections, we examine the details of how newly synthesized proteins move between organellar compartments of the secretory pathway, how the proteins are processed during this transit, and how they are sorted to their final destination.

## Carrier vesicles control the traffic between the organelles of the secretory pathway

As the preceding discussion suggests, the secretory pathway is not a single, smooth, continuous highway but rather a series of saltatory translocations from one discrete organellar compartment to the next. Each of these steps requires some orchestration to ensure that the newly synthesized proteins arrive at their next terminus.

The cell solves the problem of moving newly synthesized proteins between membranous organelles by using membrane-enclosed carrier vesicles (or vesicular carriers). Each time proteins are to be moved from one compartment to the next, they are gathered together within or beneath specialized regions of membrane that subsequently evaginate or pinch off to produce a carrier vesicle (see Fig. 2-18). Secretory proteins reside within the lumen of the carrier vesicle, whereas membrane proteins span the vesicle's own encapsulating bilayer. On arrival at the appropriate destination, the carrier vesicle fuses with the membrane of the acceptor organelle, thus delivering its contents of soluble proteins to the organelle's lumen and its cargo of membrane proteins to the organelle's own membrane. Carrier vesicles mediate the transport of secretory and membrane proteins across the space between the ER's transition zone and the cis-Golgi stack and also between the rims of the Golgi stacks themselves. Often assisting the movement between one vesicular compartment and the next are the cytoskeleton and molecular motors. (○) N2-4

A few critical facts deserve emphasis. First, throughout the formation, transit, and fusion of a carrier vesicle, no mixing occurs between the vesicle lumen and cytosol. The same principle applies to the carrier vesicle's membraneprotein passengers, which were inserted into the membrane of the rough ER with a particular topology. Those domains of a membrane protein that are exposed to the cytosol in the rough ER remain exposed to the cytosol as the protein completes its journey through the secretory pathway.

Second, the flow of vesicular membranes is not unidirectional. The rate of synthesis of new membrane lipid and protein in the ER is less than the rate at which carrier vesicles bud off of the ER that is bound for the Golgi. Because the sizes of the ER and Golgi are relatively constant, the membrane that moves to the Golgi via carrier vesicles must return to the ER. This return is again accomplished by vesicular carriers. Each discrete step of the secretory pathway must maintain vesicle-mediated backflow of membrane from the acceptor to the donor compartment so that each compartment can retain a constant size.

Finally, we have already noted that each organelle along the secretory pathway is endowed with a specific set of "resident" membrane proteins that determines the properties of the organelle. Despite the rapid forward and backward flow of carrier vesicles between successive stations of the secretory pathway, the resident membrane proteins do not get swept along in the flow. They are either actively retained in their home organelles' membranes or actively retrieved by the returning "retrograde" carrier vesicles. Thus, not only the size but also the composition of each organelle of the secretory pathway remains essentially constant despite the rapid flux of newly synthesized proteins that it constantly handles.

## Specialized protein complexes, such as clathrin and coatamers, mediate the formation and fusion of vesicles in the secretory pathway

The formation of a vesicle through evagination appears to be geometrically indistinguishable from its fusion with a target membrane. In both cases, a cross-sectional view in the electron microscope reveals an "omega" profile, which is so named because the vesicle maintains a narrow opening to the organellar lumen that resembles the shape of the Greek letter omega ( $\Omega$ ). However, different problems are confronted during the formation and fusion of membrane vesicles.

Vesicle Formation in the Secretory Pathway To form a spherical vesicle from a planar membrane, the mechanism that pulls the vesicle off from the larger membrane must grab onto the membrane over the entire surface of the nascent vesicle. The mechanism that achieves this makes use of a scaffold that is composed of coat proteins. The cell has at least two and probably more varieties of coat proteins. The best characterized of these is clathrin, which mediates the formation of secretory vesicles from the trans Golgi. Clathrin also mediates the internalization of membrane from the cell surface during the process of endocytosis, which is the reverse of exocytosis. Another major protein coat that is involved in trafficking of vesicles between the ER and Golgi, and between the stacks of the Golgi, is a protein complex

# N2-10 The Porosome 

## Contributed by Bhanu P. Jena

Porosomes are the universal secretory machinery in cells. In the past decade, this newly discovered cellular structure at the cell plasma membrane, measuring only a few nanometers, has provided a molecular understanding of the secretory process in cells. Porosomes are supramolecular lipoprotein structures at the cell plasma membrane, where membrane-bound secretory vesicles transiently dock and fuse to release intravesicular contents to the outside during cell secretion. The mouth of the porosome opening to the outside ranges in size from 150 nm in diameter in acinar cells of the exocrine pancreas to 12 nm in neurons. The mouth dilates during cell secretion, returning to its resting size following completion of the process (eFig. 2-2).

The past decade has witnessed the elucidation of the composition of the porosome, as well as its structure, its dynamics at nanometer resolution and in real time, and its functional reconstitution into artificial lipid membranes. Experiments have also demonstrated the molecular mechanism of secretory vesicle fusion at the porosome base as well as secretory vesicle swelling enabling expulsion of intravesicular contents. It has become clear that secretory vesicles transiently dock, fuse, partially expel their contents, and dissociate-a process that allows multiple rounds of docking-fusion-expulsion-dissociation to occur. It has been
further determined that swelling of secretory vesicles is required for the expulsion of intravesicular contents during cell secretion, and the extent of swelling is directly proportional to the amount of vesicular contents expelled. These findings have led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of cell secretion, resolving the longstanding conundrum regarding the generation of partially empty vesicles as seen in electron micrographs following cell secretion.

B, A complex of proteins forms a bridge between the vesicle and the target membranes. ATP provides the fuel for fusion. The Rab appears to be a molecular switch.
known as coatamer. Both clathrin and coatamer proteins form the borders of a cage-like lattice.

In the case of clathrin, the coat proteins preassemble in the cytoplasm to form three-armed "triskelions" (Fig. 2-19A). A triskelion is not planar but resembles the three adjoining edges of a tetrahedron. As triskelions attach to one another, they produce a three-dimensional structure resembling a geodesic dome with a roughly spherical shape. A triskelion constitutes each vertex in the lattice of hexagons and pentagons that form the cage.

The triskelions of clathrin attach indirectly to the surface of the membrane that is to be excised by binding to the cytosolic tails of membrane proteins. Mediating this binding are adapter proteins, called adaptins, that link the membrane protein tails to the triskelion scaffold. The specificity for particular membrane proteins is apparently conferred by specialized adaptins. Triskelions assemble spontaneously to form a complete cage that attaches to the underlying membrane and pulls it up into a spherical configuration.

Completion of the cage occurs simultaneously with the pinching off of the evaginated membrane from the planar surface, forming a closed sphere.

The pinching off, or fission, process involves the action of a GTP-binding protein called dynamin, which forms a collar around the neck of the forming vesicle and plays a role in severing the neck. The fission process must include an intermediate that resembles the structure depicted in Figure 2-19A. According to the prevalent view, each of the lumenfacing leaflets of membrane lipids fuse, leaving only the cytoplasmic leaflets to form a continuous bridge from the vesicle to the donor membrane. This bridge then breaks, and fission is complete.

Once formed, the clathrin-coated vesicle cannot fuse with its target membrane until it loses its cage, which prevents the two membranes from achieving the close contact required to permit fusion. Because formation of the clathrin cage is spontaneous and energetically favorable, dissolution of the cage requires energy. Uncoating is accomplished by a special

class of cytoplasmic enzymes that hydrolyze ATP and use the energy thus liberated to disassemble the scaffold (see Fig. 2-19A).

The function of coatamers is similar to that of clathrin in that coatamers form a cage around a budding membrane. However, coatamer coats differ from clathrin cages in several respects. First, coatamer coats are composed of several coatamer proteins (COPs), one of which is related to the adaptins. Second, unlike the spontaneous assembly of the clathrin triskelions, assembly of the coatamer coat around the budding vesicle requires ATP. Third, a coatamer-coated vesicle retains its coat until it docks with its target membrane.

Vesicle Fusion in the Secretory Pathway Membrane fusion occurs when the hydrophobic cores of two bilayers come into contact with one another, a process that requires the two membranes to be closely apposed. Because the cytoplasmic leaflets of most cellular membranes are predominantly composed of negatively charged phospholipids, electrostatic repulsion prevents this close apposition from occurring spontaneously. To overcome this charge barrier, and to assist in targeting as well, a multicomponent protein complex forms and acts as a bridge, linking vesicular membrane proteins to membrane proteins in the target bilayer (see Fig. 2-19B). Investigators have established the components of this complex by use of three approaches: studies of the membranefusion steps involved in vesicular transport between successive Golgi stacks, genetic analysis of protein secretion in yeast, and molecular dissection of the protein constituents of the synaptic vesicles of nerve terminals. In each case, the same proteins are instrumental in attaching the donor and target membranes to one another.

The central components of the bridge are proteins known as SNAREs (so named because they act as receptors for the SNAPs discussed in the next paragraph). There are SNAREs in both the vesicular membrane (v-SNAREs) and the membrane of the target organelle (t-SNAREs). Typical of the SNARE family members are those that participate in the fusion of neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane of the axons in neurons (see pp. 219221). In that setting, the v-SNARE is known as synaptobrevin, and proteins known as syntaxin and SNAP-25 (synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa ) together act as t-SNAREs. The t-SNAREs and v-SNAREs bind to each other extremely tightly, pulling the vesicular and target membranes close together. This proximity alone may be sufficient to initiate fusion, although this point remains controversial. In cells that employ rapid and tightly regulated membrane fusion, such as neurons, a protein called synaptotagmin, which associates with the SNARE fusion complex, senses an increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and triggers fusion (see pp. 219-221). Although the nature of the fusion event itself remains unclear, clues have emerged about its regulation. Fusion requires the participation of a class of small GTP-binding proteins called Rabs that are important for signaling. Rabs appear to act as molecular switches that assemble with the SNARE fusion complex when they are binding GTP but dissociate from the complex after they hydrolyze the GTP to GDP. Rab-GTP appears to play a critical role in regulating the activity of the fusion complex.

Numerous Rab isoforms exist, each isoform associated with a different vesicular compartment and a distinct membraneto-membrane translocation step.

Once fusion occurs, the former vesicle generally loses its spherical shape rapidly as it becomes incorporated into the target membrane. This "flattening out" is the result of surface tension, inasmuch as the narrow radius of curvature demanded by a small spherical vesicle is energetically unfavorable. After fusion, it is also necessary to disassemble the v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex so that its components can be reused in subsequent fusion events. The dissociation step involves the activity of two additional components that participate in the SNARE complex. The first is an ATPhydrolyzing enzyme; because it is inhibited by the alkylating agent N -ethylmaleimide (NEM), it was named NEMsensitive factor (NSF). Soluble NSF attachment proteins (the SNAPs mentioned above), which target NSF to the SNARE complex, are the second. Hydrolysis of ATP by NSF causes dissociation of the SNARE complex, thus regenerating the fusion machinery. Homologs of the neuronal t-SNARE and v-SNARE proteins are found in almost every cell type in the body and are thought to participate in most if not all membrane fusion events.

## Newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins are processed during their passage through the secretory pathway

While in the rough ER, newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins undergo the first in a series of posttranslational modifications (see pp. 32-34), including glycosylation, disulfide bond formation, and the acquisition of tertiary structure. On delivery to the cis stack of the Golgi complex, these proteins begin a new phase in their postsynthetic maturation. For many proteins, the most visible byproduct of this second phase is the complete remodeling of their N -linked sugar chains, originally attached in the rough ER.

Of the 14 sugar residues transferred en bloc to newly synthesized proteins during N -linked glycosylation (see p. 32), nine are mannose and three are glucose (Fig. 2-20A). Enzymes called glucosidases and one called a mannosidase associate with the luminal face of the ER and remove the three glucose residues and one mannose. This trimming process is a critical step in the quality-control process through which the cell determines whether a protein is properly folded and ready to proceed to subsequent stations of the secretory pathway. An enzyme called uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose glycoprotein glucosyltransferase (UGGT) inspects proteins in the lumen of the ER. If they are not appropriately folded, UGGT adds a single glucose residue to the trimmed sugar tree. Proteins bearing this single glucose residue bind calnexin or calreticulin, ER chaperone proteins that retain misfolded proteins until they fold correctly or become targeted for degradation.

As proteins arrive from the ER, mannosidases in the cis Golgi attack the N -linked sugar trees, shearing off all except two N -acetylglucosamine and five mannose residues. As the proteins pass from the cis-Golgi cisterna to the medial cisterna and ultimately to the trans-Golgi cisterna, another mannosidase removes two additional mannose residues, and

A trisaccharide links glycosaminoglycan chains to the protein via the -OH group of a serine residue. The glycosaminoglycan is made up of $n$ repeating disaccharide units, one of which is always an amino sugar.
other enzymes add sugars to the stump of the original sugar tree in a process referred to as complex glycosylation.

The addition of new sugars occurs one residue at a time and is accomplished by enzymes called sugar transferases that face the lumens of the Golgi stacks. Each sugar is transported from the cytoplasm to the Golgi lumen by a carrier protein that spans the Golgi membrane. Throughout the maturation process, the N-linked sugar chains are always exposed only to the luminal face of the Golgi. (T) 92-11

Each cisterna of the Golgi is characterized by a different set of sugar transferases and sugar transporters. Thus, each Golgi compartment catalyzes a distinct step in the maturation of the N-linked chains. Complex glycosylation, therefore, proceeds like an assembly line from one modification station to the next. Because proteins have different shapes and sizes, however, the degree to which a sugar chain of any given polypeptide has access to each transferase can vary quite extensively. Thus, each protein emerges from the
assembly line with its own particular pattern of complex glycosylation. The Golgi's trans-most cisterna houses the enzymes responsible for adding the terminal sugars, which cap the N-linked chain. The final residue of these terminal sugars is frequently N -acetylneuraminic acid, also known as sialic acid. At neutral pH , sialic acid is negatively charged. This acidic sugar residue therefore is responsible for the net negative electrostatic charge that is frequently carried by glycoproteins.

The Golgi's function is not limited to creating N-linked sugar tree toplaries. It oversees a number of other posttranslational modifications, including the assembly of O-linked sugars. Many proteins possess O-linked sugar chains, which attach not to asparagine residues but to the hydroxyl groups (hence, O ) of serine and threonine residues. The O-linked sugars are not preassembled for en-bloc transfer the way that the original 14-sugar tree is added in the rough ER in the case of their N-linked counterparts.

# N2-11 Sugar Uptake into the Golgi 

## Contributed by Michael Caplan

The attachment of a sugar molecule to the growing N -linked sugar chain occurs in a series of four steps:
Step 1: In the cytosol, the sugar is covalently coupled to a nucleoside diphosphate (either UDP or GDP, depending on the sugar to be transported). The result of this reaction is a sugar nucleoside diphosphate (e.g., UDP-galactose). (An exception to this rule is sialic acid, in which the sugar is coupled to cytidine monophosphate [CMP], a nucleoside monophosphate, rather than a diphosphate.)
Step 2: A carrier protein in the membrane of the Golgi moves the sugar nucleoside diphosphate from the cytoplasm to the lumen of the Golgi.
Step 3: The sugar transferases use the sugar nucleoside diphosphate (e.g., UDP-galactose) as a substrate by catalyzing a reaction that couples the sugar residue (e.g., galactose) to the growing N-linked chain. As a byproduct, this reaction generates a nucleoside diphosphate (e.g., UDP), which is then converted to a nucleoside monophosphate (uridine monophosphate [UMP]) plus inorganic phosphate.
Step 4: The same carrier protein that imports the sugar nucleoside diphosphate (e.g., UDP-galactose) exports the nucleoside monophosphate (e.g., UMP) that is the byproduct of the above transferase reaction. Because the carrier protein simultaneously imports the sugar nucleoside diphosphate and exports the nucleoside monophosphate, this carrier protein is an example of an exchanger (see pp. 123-125).

Instead, the O-linked sugars are added one residue at a time by sugar transferases such as those that participate in the remodeling of complex N -linked glycosylation. O-linked chains frequently carry a great deal of negatively charged sialic acid.

Proteoglycans contain a very large number of a special class of O-linked sugar chains that are extremely long (see Fig. 2-20B). Unlike other O-linked sugars that attach to the protein core via an N -acetylglucosamine, the sugar chain in a proteoglycan attaches via a xylose-containing threesugar "linker" to a serine residue on the protein backbone. One or more glycosaminoglycan side chains are added to this linker, one sugar at a time, to form the mature proteoglycan.

As the sugar chains grow, enzymes can add sulfate groups and greatly increase the quantity of negative charge that they carry. Sulfated proteoglycans that are secreted proteins become important components of the extracellular matrix and are also constituents of mucus. Proteoglycan chains can also be attached to membrane proteins that eventually reach the plasma membrane. The negatively charged sugars that are associated with the glycosaminoglycan groups, which are present both in mucus and on cell surface glycoproteins, can help form a barrier that protects cells from harsh environmental conditions such as those inside the stomach (see p. 874). In the upper portion of the respiratory tract, the mucus assists in the removal of foreign bodies (see p. 597).

## Newly synthesized proteins are sorted in the trans-Golgi network

From their common point of origin at the rough ER, newly synthesized secretory and membrane proteins must be distributed to a wide variety of different subcellular destinations. How can a cell recognize an individual protein from among the multitudes that are inserted into or across the membranes of the rough ER and ensure its delivery to the site of its ultimate functional residence? Such a sorting operation has two prerequisites: (1) each protein to be sorted must carry some manner of address or "sorting signal" that communicates its destination, and (2) the cell must possess machinery capable of reading this sorting signal and acting on the information it embodies.

For many proteins, sorting occurs in the trans-Golgi network (TGN). The trans-most cisterna of the Golgi complex is morphologically and biochemically distinct from the other Golgi stacks. Viewed in cross section, it appears as a complex web of membranous tubules and vesicles (Fig. 2-21). This structure befits the TGN's apparent function as a staging area from which carrier vesicles depart to transport their specific protein cargoes to one of many distinct subcellular locales.

Sorting machinery within or at the TGN appears to segregate classes of proteins-each bound for a common destination-into small discrete clusters. Each cluster is
![bo344543376c](bo344543376c.jpg)

subsequently incorporated into a separate carrier vesicle, which evaginates from the TGN membrane and mediates the final stage of delivery. In the case of secretory proteins, this clustering happens within the lumen of the TGN. In fact, such clusters of secretory proteins can be directly visualized in the electron microscope. Membrane proteins gather into two-dimensional clusters in the plane of the TGN membrane. Carrier vesicles incorporate these clusters into their own bilayers. Proteins bound for different destinations co-cluster in different subdomains of the TGN. Secretory and membrane proteins that are earmarked for the same destination can cluster in the same subdomain of the TGN and can be incorporated into the same carrier vesicle. Therefore, the TGN appears to function as a cellular transportation terminal that is able to direct groups of passengers who are carrying the same tickets to a common waiting area and ultimately to load them onto a common shuttle. Ticket agents herd passengers bearing different tickets into different waiting lounges.

## A mannose-6-phosphate recognition marker is required to target newly synthesized hydrolytic enzymes to lysosomes

One of the most thoroughly established sorting paradigms is the pathway for newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes. Like secretory proteins, lysosomal enzymes carry aminoterminal signal sequences that direct their cotranslational translocation across the membrane of the rough ER. Their N -linked glycosylation and folding proceed in the usual fashion, after which they join all of the other simultaneously synthesized proteins in the Golgi complex (see Fig. 2-21, stage 1).

A special sugar transferase in the cis-Golgi cisterna recognizes newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes and adds a unique sugar. This enzyme adds $N$-acetylglucosamine phosphate to the mannose residues at the termini of the lysosomal enzymes' N -linked sugar trees. This enzyme differs from the usual sugar transferases (see p. 38) in that it adds a phosphosugar group to the mannose residue, rather than just a sugar. This enzyme is also unique in recognizing specific aminoacid sequences that are exclusively in these lysosomal enzymes. A second cis-Golgi enzyme removes the additional N -acetylglucosamine sugar, leaving its phosphate group behind. As a result, the sugar trees of the lysosomal enzymes terminate in mannose-6-phosphate residues (see Fig. 2-21, stage 2).

A special class of mannose-6-phosphate receptors, localized predominantly in the elements of the trans Golgi, recognize proteins that carry mannose-6-phosphate groups (see Fig. 2-21, stage 3). This recognition step constitutes the first stage of the cosegregation and clustering process discussed above. The mannose-6-phosphate receptors are transmembrane proteins. Their luminal portions bind to the newly synthesized lysosomal enzymes, whereas their cytoplasmically facing tails possess a particular signal that allows them to interact with adaptins and hence to be incorporated into clathrin-coated vesicles. The assembly of the clathrin lattice causes the mannose-6-phosphate receptors to cluster, along with their associated lysosomal enzymes, in the plane of the TGN membrane. Completion of the clathrin cage results in
the formation of a vesicle whose membrane contains the mannose-6-phosphate receptors that bind their cargo of lysosomal enzymes.

After departing the TGN, these transport vesicles lose their clathrin coats (see Fig. 2-21, stage 4) and fuse with structures referred to as late endosomes or prelysosomal endosomes. Proton pumps in the membranes of these organelles ensure that their luminal pH is acidic (see Fig. 2-21, stage 5). When exposed to this acidic environment, the mannose-6-phosphate receptors undergo a conformational change that releases the mannose-6-phosphate-bearing lysosomal enzymes (see Fig. 2-21, stage 6). Consequently, the newly synthesized enzymes are dumped into the lumen of the prelysosomal endosome, which will go on to fuse with or mature into a lysosome. The empty mannose-6-phosphate receptors join vesicles that bud off from the lysosome (see Fig. 2-21, stage 7) and return to the TGN (see Fig. 2-21, stage 8). The luminal environment of the TGN allows the receptors to recover their affinity for mannose-6-phosphate, which permits them to participate in subsequent rounds of sorting.

Disruption of lysosomal sorting can be produced in several ways. For example, a drug called tunicamycin blocks the addition of N -linked sugars to newly synthesized proteins and thereby prevents attachment of the mannose-6phosphate recognition marker. Compounds that elevate the luminal pH of the prelysosomal endosomes prevent newly synthesized enzymes from dissociating from the mannose-6-phosphate receptors and consequently block recycling of the receptor pool back to the TGN. The resulting shortage of unoccupied receptors allows mannose-6-phosphatebearing proteins to pass through the TGN unrecognized (Box 2-2). Thus, instead of diverting to the lysosomes, these lysosomal enzymes continue along the secretory pathway and are ultimately released from the cell by constitutive secretion.

## Cells internalize extracellular material and plasma membrane through the process of endocytosis

The same fundamental mechanisms in the secretory pathway that produce vesicles by evaginating regions of Golgi membrane can also move material in the opposite direction by inducing vesicle formation through the invagination of regions of the plasma membrane. Vesicles created in this fashion are delimited by membrane that had formerly been part of the cell surface, and their luminal contents derive from the extracellular compartment.

This internalization process, referred to as endocytosis, serves the cell in at least four ways. First, certain nutrients are too large to be imported from the ECF into the cytoplasm via transmembrane carrier proteins; they are instead carried into the cell by endocytosis. Second, endocytosis of hormonereceptor complexes can terminate the signaling processes that are initiated by numerous hormones. Third, endocytosis is the first step in remodeling or degrading portions of the plasma membrane. Membrane that is delivered to the surface during exocytosis must be retrieved and ultimately returned to the TGN. Fourth, proteins or pathogens that need to be cleared from the extracellular compartment are brought into the cell by endocytosis and subsequently condemned to degradation in the lysosomes. Because endocytosed material can

pursue a number of different destinies, there must be sorting mechanisms in the endocytic pathway, just as in the secretory pathway, that allow the cell to direct the endocytosed material to its appropriate destination.

Fluid-phase endocytosis is the uptake of the materials that are dissolved in the ECF (Fig. 2-22, stage 1) and not specifically bound to receptors on the cell surface. This process begins when a clathrin cage starts to assemble on the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane. Above we
discussed the physiology of clathrin-coated vesicles in the secretory pathway (see Fig. 2-19). The clathrin attaches to the membrane through interactions with adaptin proteins, which in turn adhere to the cytoplasmic tail domains of certain transmembrane polypeptides. Construction of the cage causes its adherent underlying membrane to invaginate and to form a coated pit (see Fig. 2-22, stage 2A). Completion of the cage creates a closed vesicle, which detaches from the cell surface through the process of membrane fission (see

# BOX 2-2 Lysosomal Storage Diseases 

n lysosomal storage diseases, the absence of a particular hydrolase-or group of hydrolases-from the lysosome prevents the lysosome from degrading certain substances, resulting in the formation of overstuffed lysosomes that crowd the cytoplasm and impede cell function. Indeed, a naturally occurring human disease-caused by a genetic defect in the sorting machinery-allowed the elucidation of lysosomal enzyme sorting.

In I-cell disease, most hydrolases are missing from the lysosomes of many cell types. As a result, lysosomes become engorged with massive quantities of undigested substrates. The enormously swollen lysosomes that characterize this disease were named inclusion bodies, and the cells that possess them were designated inclusion cells, or I cells for short. Whereas I cells lack most lysosomal enzymes, the genes that encode all of the hydrolases are completely normal. The mutation responsible for I-cell disease resides in the gene for the phosphosugar transferase that creates the mannose-6-phosphate recognition marker (see Fig. 2-21). Without this enzyme, the cell cannot sort any of the hydrolases to the lysosomes. Instead, the hydrolases
pass through the TGN unnoticed by the mannose-6-phosphate receptors and are secreted constitutively from the affected cells.

In some other lysosomal storage diseases, specific hydrolases are not missorted but rather are genetically defective. For example, children who suffer from Tay-Sachs disease carry a homozygous mutation in the gene that encodes the lysosomal enzyme hexosaminidase A (HEX A). Consequently, their lysosomes are unable to degrade substances that contain certain specific sugar linkages. Because they cannot be broken down, these substances accumulate in lysosomes. Over time, these substances fill the lysosomes, which swell and crowd the cytoplasm. The resulting derangements of cellular function are toxic to a number of cell types and ultimately underlie this disease's uniform fatality within the first few years of life. Carriers of the Tay-Sachs trait can be detected either by HEX A enzyme testing or by DNA analysis of the HEX A gene. Among the Ashkenazi Jewish population, in whom 1 in 27 individuals is a carrier, three distinct HEX A mutations account for $98 \%$ of all carrier mutations.

Figure 2-22 Endocytosis.

Fig. 2-22, stage 3). The resultant vesicle quickly loses its clathrin coat through the action of the uncoating ATPase and fuses with an organelle called an endosome.

## Receptor-mediated endocytosis is responsible for internalizing specific proteins

Most of the proteins that a cell seeks to import via endocytosis are present in the ECF in extremely low concentrations. Furthermore, the volume of ECF that is internalized by an individual coated vesicle is very small. Consequently, the probability that any particular target molecule will enter the cell during a given round of fluid-phase endocytosis is low. To improve the efficiency of endocytosis and to ensure that the desired extracellular components are gathered in every endocytic cycle, the cell has devised a method for concentrating specific proteins at the site of endocytosis before initiating their uptake.

This concentration is achieved in a process known as receptor-mediated endocytosis, in which molecules to be internalized (see Fig. 2-22, stage 1) bind to cell-surface receptors with high affinity (see Fig. 2-22, stage 2B). Through this interaction, the substrates for endocytosis become physically associated with the plasma membrane, which greatly enhances the probability that they will be successfully internalized. Cells increase this probability even further by ensuring that the receptors themselves cluster in regions of the membrane destined to be endocytosed. The cytoplasmic tails of these receptors are endowed with recognition sequences that allow them to serve as binding sites for adaptins. Consequently, these receptors congregate in regions of the cell membrane where clathrin cages are assembling and are incorporated into coated pits as they are forming. The affinity of these receptors for the endocytic machinery ensures that their ligands are internalized with maximum efficiency.

Many endocytic receptors are constitutively associated with coated pits and are endocytosed whether or not they have bound their specific ligands. The cytoplasmic tails of certain receptors, however, interact with adaptins only when the receptor is in the bound state. For example, in the absence of epidermal growth factor (EGF), the EGF receptor is excluded from regions of the membrane in which coated pits are assembling. Modifications induced by ligand binding alter these receptors' tails, which allows them to participate in coated vesicle formation and hence in endocytosis.

After the clathrin-coated vesicle forms (see Fig. 2-22, stage 3), it quickly loses its clathrin coat, as described above for fluid-phase endocytosis, and fuses with an endosome. Although endosomes can be wildly pleomorphic, they frequently have an appearance like a frying pan, in which a round vesicular body is attached to a long tubular "handle" (see Fig. 2-22, stage 4). The cytoplasmic surfaces of the handles are often decorated with forming clathrin lattices and are the sites of vesicular budding.

## Endocytosed proteins can be targeted to lysosomes or recycled to the cell surface

In many cell types, endocytosis is so rapid that, each hour, the cell internalizes a quantity of membrane that is
equivalent in area to the entire cell surface. To persist in the face of this tremendous flux of membrane, the cell must retrieve most of the endocytosed membrane components and return them to the plasma membrane. However, substances that a cell wishes to degrade must be routed to lysosomes and prevented from escaping back to the surface. The sophisticated sorting operation required to satisfy both of these conditions takes place in the endosome.

Proton pumps embedded in its membrane ensure that, like the lysosome, the endosome maintains an acidic luminal pH (see Fig. 2-22, stage 4). This acidic environment initiates the separation of material that is destined for lysosomal destruction from those proteins that are to be recycled. Most endocytic receptors bind their ligands tightly at neutral pH but release them rapidly at pH values $<6.0$. Therefore, as soon as a surface-derived vesicle fuses with an endosome, proteins that are bound to receptors fall off and enter the endosomal lumen. The receptor proteins segregate in the membranes of the handles of the frying pan-shaped endosomes and are ultimately removed from the endosome in vesicles that shuttle them back to the cell surface (see Fig. 2-22, stage 5). The soluble proteins of the endosome lumen, which include the receptors' former ligands, are ultimately delivered to the lysosome. This sorting scheme allows the receptors to avoid the fate of their cargo and ensures that the receptors are used in many rounds of endocytosis.

The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor ( $\mathbf{N 2}$-12 follows this regimen precisely. On arrival of the LDL-laden receptor at the endosome, the acidic environment of the endosome induces the LDL to dissociate from its receptor, which then promptly recycles to the cell surface. The LDL travels on to the lysosome, where enzymes destroy the LDL and liberate its bound cholesterol.

A variation on this paradigm is responsible for the cellular uptake of iron. Iron circulates in the plasma bound to a protein called transferrin. At the mildly alkaline pH of ECF, the iron-transferrin complex binds with high affinity to a transferrin receptor in the plasma membranes of almost every cell type. Bound transferrin is internalized by endocytosis and delivered to endosomes. Instead of inducing transferrin to fall off its receptor, the acid environment of the endosome lumen causes iron to fall off transferrin. Apotransferrin (i.e., transferrin without bound iron) remains tightly bound to the transferrin receptor at an acidic pH . The released iron is transported across the endosomal membrane for use in the cytosol. The complex of apotransferrin and the transferrin receptor recycles to the cell surface, where it is again exposed to the ECF. The mildly alkaline extracellular pH causes the transferrin receptor to lose its affinity for apotransferrin and to promptly release it. Thus, the cell uses the pH -dependent sorting trick twice to ensure that both the transferrin receptor and apotransferrin recycle for subsequent rounds of iron uptake.

# N2-12 Familial Hypercholesterolemia: A Defect in Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis 

## Contributed by Michael Caplan

The critical physiologic role played by endocytic receptors is underscored by the molecular pathogenesis of a relatively common human genetic disease. Cholesterol is carried through the bloodstream bound to binding proteins, one of which is known as low-density lipoprotein, or LDL. Many cells throughout the body express receptors for LDL at their plasma membranes. These cells internalize receptor-bound LDL and utilize its cargo of cholesterol for membrane synthesis and in various biochemical pathways. The imported cholesterol also serves to inhibit the cells' endogenous de novo synthesis of cholesterol. The disease known as familial hypercholesterolemia (FHC) is caused by a defect in the gene encoding the LDL receptor, resulting in the synthesis of receptors that either do not bind LDL or fail to be internalized.

In the absence of functional LDL receptors, cells are unable to import exogenous cholesterol. Even though serum cholesterol levels rise to extraordinarily high levels, cells are oblivious to its presence, inasmuch as they lack the machinery that allows them to endocytose LDL. Consequently, their cholesterol synthesis continues uninhibited. The excess cholesterol synthesis results in the buildup of cholesterol-filled lipid droplets in cells throughout
the body. Accumulation of these cholesterol inclusions in the cells lining arterial walls produces atherosclerotic plaques, which can go on to occupy and occlude the lumens of the blood vessels themselves. When these plaques appear in the coronary arteries, which supply the heart (see p. 560), they impede coronary blood flow and thus prevent the heart from receiving sufficient oxygen. Not surprisingly, patients with FHC often succumb to heart disease at relatively early ages. Patients who are homozygous for defective LDL receptors usually experience their first myocardial infarction ("heart attack") in their early teens, whereas heterozygotes (whose cells express half the normal complement of functional LDL receptor) generally experience cardiac symptoms in midlife. The heterozygous form of FHC affects $\sim 1$ in 500 people. Our current understanding of receptor-mediated endocytosis, and of the molecular interactions on which it depends, owes a tremendous amount to insights gained through the study of FHC by Brown and Goldstein, whose work earned them the 1985 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology. For more information about Brown and Goldstein and the work that led to their Nobel Prize, visit http://www.nobel.se/medicine/laureates/1985/ index.html (accessed October 2014).

line blood vessels long ago revealed the presence of clusters of small vesicles that display a characteristic appearance, in close association with the plasma membrane. These caveolae were thought to be involved in the transfer of large molecules across the endothelial cells, from the blood space to the tissue compartment. In fact, caveolae are present in most cell types. The caveolae are rich in cholesterol and sphingomyelin. Rather than having a clathrin lattice, they contain intrinsic membrane proteins called caveolins, which face the cytosol (see Fig. 2-22). In addition, caveolae appear to be rich in membrane-associated polypeptides that participate in intracellular signaling, such as the Ras-like proteins (see p. 56) as well as heterotrimeric GTP-binding proteins (see p. 52). Caveolae appear to serve as organizing centers for collections of signaling molecules, perhaps allowing them to coordinate their activities. Caveolae also participate in the endocytosis of certain substances. In vascular endothelial cells, for example, caveolae take up albumin and carry it across the cell to the opposite side in a process known as transcytosis (see p. 467). Caveolae-mediated uptake does not involve clathrin or the acidified endocytic structures of the standard endocytotic pathway.

Also enriched in caveolae is the receptor for folate, a vitamin required by several metabolic pathways (see pp. 933-935). Unlike the receptors in the plasma membrane (see pp. 17-18), the folate receptor has no cytoplasmic tail that might allow it to associate with coated pits. Instead, it belongs to the GPI-linked class of proteins (see p. 17) that are anchored to the membrane through covalent attachment to phospholipid molecules. It appears that caveolae mediate the internalization of folate. In fact, a large number and variety of GPI-linked proteins are embedded in the outer leaflet of the caveolar membrane that faces its lumen.

## SPECIALIZED CELL TYPES

All cells are constructed of the same basic elements and share the same basic metabolic and biosynthetic machinery. What distinguishes one cell type from another? Certainly, cells have different shapes and molecular structures. In addition, out of an extensive repertory of molecules that cells are capable of making, each cell type chooses which molecules to express, how to organize these molecules, and how to regulate them. It is this combination of choices that endows them with specific physiological functions. These specializations are the product of cell differentiation. Each of these cell types arises from a stem cell. Stem cells are mitotically active and can give rise to a spectrum of cellular lineages that can range from multiple to limited. Thus, they may be pluripotent, multipotent, oligopotent, or unipotent. Clearly, the zygote is the ultimate stem cell because through its divisions, it gives rise to every cell lineage present in the complete organism and is thus totipotent. Specific cell types arise from stem cells by activating a differentiationspecific program of gene expression. The interplay of environmental signals, temporal cues, and transcription factors that control the processes of cellular differentiation constitutes one of the great unraveling mysteries of modern biology.

## Epithelial cells form a barrier between the internal and external milieu

How can an organism tightly regulate its internal fluid environment (i.e., internal milieu) without allowing this environment to come into direct and disastrous contact with the external world (i.e., external milieu)? The body has solved these problems by arranging a sheet of cells-an epitheliumbetween these two disparate environments. Because of their unique subcellular designs and intercellular relationships, epithelial cells form a dynamic barrier that can import or expel substances, sometimes against steep concentration gradients.

Two structural features of epithelia permit them to function as useful barriers (Fig. 2-23). First, epithelial cells connect to one another via tight junctions, which constrain the free diffusion of solutes and fluids around the epithelial cells, between the internal and external compartments. Second, the tight junctions define a boundary between an apical and a basolateral domain of the plasma membrane. Each of these two domains is endowed with distinct protein and lipid components, and each subserves a distinct function. Thus, the surface membranes of epithelial cells are polarized. Beginning on page 136, we discuss the mechanisms by which polarized epithelial cells exploit their unique geometry to transport salts and water from one compartment to the other. However, it is worth touching on a few of the cellular specializations that characterize polarized epithelia and permit them to perform their critical roles.

The apical membranes of the epithelial cells (see Fig. 2-23) face the lumen of a compartment that is often topologically continuous with the outside world. For example, in the stomach and intestine, apical membranes form the inner surface of the organs that come into contact with ingested matter. The apical membranes of many epithelial cells, including those lining kidney tubules, are endowed with a single nonmotile cilium. Known as the central cilium, this structure may sense the mechanical deformation associated with fluid flow. Mutations that disrupt individual components of the central cilium are associated with cystic disease of the kidney, in which the normal architecture of the kidney is replaced by a collection of large fluid-filled cysts.

The basolateral membranes of epithelial cells face the ECF compartment-which indirectly makes contact with the blood-and rest on a basement membrane. The basement membrane is composed of extracellular matrix proteins that the epithelial cells themselves secrete and include collagens, laminin, and proteoglycans. The basement membrane provides the epithelium with structural support and, most importantly, serves as an organizing foundation that helps the epithelial cells to establish their remarkable architecture.

Each epithelial cell is interconnected to its neighbors by a variety of junctional complexes (see Fig. 2-23). The lateral surfaces of epithelial cells participate in numerous types of cell-cell contacts, including tight junctions, adhering junctions, gap junctions, and desmosomes.

Tight Junctions A tight junction (or zonula occludens) is a complex structure that impedes the passage of molecules and ions between the cells of the epithelial monolayer. This

![bo364543376c](bo364543376c.jpg)

Figure 2-23 Epithelial cells. In an epithelial cell, the tight junction separates the cell membrane into apical and basolateral domains that have very different functional properties.
pathway between the cells is termed the paracellular pathway. The functional properties of tight junctions are related to their intriguing architecture (see Fig. 2-23). Viewed by transmission electron microscopy, tight junctions include regions of apparent fusion between the outer leaflets of the lipid bilayer membranes of neighboring epithelial cells. Freeze-fracture electron microscopy reveals that the tight junction comprises parallel strands of closely packed particles that represent the transmembrane proteins participating in the junction's formation. The degree of an epithelium's impermeability-or "tightness"-is roughly proportional to the number of these parallel strands. The claudins, a large family of proteins, are the principal structural elements of the tight junction. Interactions between the claudins present in the apposing membranes of neighboring cells form the permeability barrier (see p. 137).

Tight junctions play several roles. First, they are barriers in that they separate one compartment from another. In some epithelial cells, such as those of the renal thick ascending limb, the tight junctions form a boundary that blocks the flow of most ions and water between cells. In contrast, the tight junctions of the renal proximal tubule are leaky, permitting significant transepithelial movement of fluid and solutes.

Second, tight junctions can act as selective gates in that they permit certain solutes to flow more easily than others.

Examples are the leaky tight junctions of tissues such as the proximal tubule. The permeability and selectivity of an epithelium's tight junctions are critical variables for determining that epithelium's transport characteristics (see pp. 136-137). Moreover, the permeability properties of the gate function of tight junctions can be modulated in response to various physiological stimuli. The inventory of claudins expressed by an epithelium in large measure determines the permeability properties of its tight junctions.

Third, tight junctions act as fences that separate the polarized surfaces of the epithelial plasma membrane into apical and basolateral domains. The presence of distinct populations of proteins and lipids in each plasma-membrane domain is absolutely essential for an epithelium to mediate transepithelial fluid and solute transport (see pp. 137-139).

Adhering Junctions An adhering junction (or zonula adherens) is a belt that encircles an entire epithelial cell just below the level of the tight junction. Epithelial cells need two pieces of information to build themselves into a coherent epithelium. First, the cells must know which end is up. The extracellular matrix (see above) provides this information by defining which side will be basolateral. Second, the cells must know that there are like neighbors with which to establish cell-cell contacts. Adhering junctions provide

epithelial cells with clues about the nature and proximity of their neighbors. These cell-cell contacts are mediated by the extracellular domains of members of the cadherin family, transmembrane proteins discussed above. Epithelial cells will organize themselves into a properly polarized epithelium-with differentiated apical and basolateral plasma membranes-only if the cadherins of neighboring cells have come into close enough apposition to form an adhering junction. Formation of these junctions initiates the assembly of a subcortical cytoskeleton, in which anchor proteins (e.g., vinculin, catenins, $\alpha$ actinin) link the cytosolic domains of cadherins to a network of actin filaments that is associated with the cytosolic surfaces of the lateral membranes. Conversely, the disruption of adhering junctions can lead to a loss of epithelial organization. In epithelial tumors, for example, loss of expression of the adhering-junction cadherins tends to correlate with the tumor cell's loss of controlled growth and with its ability to metastasize-that is, to leave the epithelial monolayer and form a new tumor at a distant site in the body. ( $\mathbf{N 2 - 1 3}$

Gap Junctions The channels that interconnect the cytosols of neighboring cells are called gap junctions (see pp. 158-159). They allow small molecules (less than $\sim 1 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) to diffuse freely between cells. In some organs, epithelial cells are interconnected by an enormous number of gap junctions, which organize into paracrystalline hexagonal arrays. Because ions can flow through gap junctions, cells that communicate through gap junctions are electrically coupled. The permeability of gap junctions, and hence the extent to which the cytoplasmic compartments of neighboring cells are coupled, can be regulated in response to a variety of physiological stimuli.

Desmosomes A desmosome (or macula adherens) holds adjacent cells together tightly at a single, round spot. Desmosomes are easily recognized in thin-section electron micrographs by the characteristic dense plaques of intermediate filaments (see p. 23). The extracellular domains of desmoglein or desmocollin, which are transmembrane proteins in the cadherin family (see p. 17) mediate the interaction of adjacent cells. Anchor proteins link the cytosolic domains of the cadherins to intermediate filaments that radiate into the cytoplasm from the point of intercellular contact (see Fig. 2-23). These filaments interact with and organize the cytoplasmic intermediate filaments, thus coupling the structurally stabilizing elements of neighboring cells to one another. Epithelial cells are often coupled to adjacent cells by numerous desmosomes, especially in regions where the epithelium is subject to physical stress.

## Epithelial cells are polarized

In many epithelia, the apical surface area is amplified by the presence of a brush border that is composed of hundreds of finger-like microvillar projections (see Fig. 2-23). In the case of the small intestine and the renal proximal tubule, the membrane covering each microvillus is richly endowed with enzymes that digest sugars and proteins as well as with transporters that carry the products of these digestions into the cells. The presence of a microvillar brush border can amplify
the apical surface area of a polarized epithelial cell by as much as 20 -fold, thus greatly enhancing its capacity to interact with, to modify, and to transport substances present in the luminal fluid.

The basolateral surface area of certain epithelial cells is amplified by the presence of lateral interdigitations and basal infoldings (see Fig. 2-23). Although they are not as elegantly constructed as microvilli, these structures can greatly increase the basolateral surface area. In epithelial cells that are involved in large volumes of transport-or in transport against steep gradients-amplifying the basolateral membrane can greatly increase the number of $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps that a single cell can place at its basolateral membrane.

Although the morphological differences between apical and basolateral membranes can be dramatic, the most important distinction between these surfaces is their protein composition. As noted above, the "fence" function of the tight junction separates completely different rosters of membrane proteins between the apical and basolateral membranes. For example, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump is restricted to the basolateral membrane in almost all epithelial cells, and the membrane-bound enzymes that hydrolyze complex sugars and peptides are restricted to apical membranes in intestinal epithelial cells. The polarized distribution of transport proteins is absolutely necessary for the directed movement of solutes and water across epithelia. Furthermore, the restriction of certain enzymes to the apical domain limits their actions to the lumen of the epithelium and therefore offers the advantage of not wasting energy putting enzymes where they are not needed. The polarity of epithelial membrane proteins also plays a critical role in detecting antigens present in the external milieu and in transmitting signals between the external and internal compartments.

The maintenance of epithelial polarity involves complex intermolecular interactions. When tight junctions are disrupted, diffusion in the plane of the membrane leads to intermingling of apical and basolateral membrane components and thus a loss of polarity. The subcortical cytoskeleton beneath the basolateral surface may play a similar role in maintaining polarity by physically restraining a subset of membrane proteins at the basolateral surface.

However, such mechanisms for stabilizing the polarized distributions of membrane proteins do not explain how newly synthesized proteins come to be distributed at the appropriate plasma membrane. We give two examples of mechanisms that cells can use to direct membrane proteins to either the basolateral or apical membrane. The first example focuses on protein-protein interactions. As noted during our discussion of the secretory protein pathway, the sorting operation that separates apically from basolaterally directed proteins apparently occurs in the TGN (see p. 39). Some proteins destined for the basolateral membrane have special amino-acid motifs that act as sorting signals. Some of these motifs are similar to those that allow membrane proteins to participate in endocytosis. Members of the adaptin family recognize these motifs during the formation of clathrin-coated vesicles at the TGN and segregate the basolateral proteins into a vesicle destined for the basolateral membrane.

Another example of mechanisms that cells use to generate a polarized distribution of membrane proteins focuses on

lipid-lipid interactions. In many epithelia, GPI-linked proteins are concentrated exclusively at the apical surface. It appears that the phospholipid components of GPI-linked proteins are unusual in that they cluster into complexes of fairly immobile gel-phase lipids during their passage through the Golgi apparatus. We saw above how lakes of phospholipids with different physical properties may segregate within a membrane (see p. 10). The "glycolipid rafts" of GPI-linked proteins incorporate into apically directed vesicles so that sorting can occur through lipid-lipid interactions in the
plane of the membrane rather than through protein-protein interactions at the cytoplasmic surface of the Golgi membrane. From these two examples, it should be clear that a number of different mechanisms may contribute to protein sorting and the maintenance of epithelial polarity.

# SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION 

Lloyd Cantley

Even single-cell organisms must respond to environmental challenges, which necessitated the development of signaltransduction mechanisms. The evolution of multicellular organisms required the evolution of cell-to-cell communication within the organism to coordinate between cells activities ranging from the induction of embryonic development to the integration of physiological responses.

All cells receive and process information. External signals such as odorants, metabolites, ions, hormones, growth factors, and neurotransmitters can all serve as chemical messengers linking neighboring or distant cells. Even external signals that are not considered chemical in nature (e.g., light and mechanical or thermal stimuli) may ultimately be transduced into a chemical messenger. Most chemical messengers interact with specific cell-surface receptors and trigger a cascade of secondary events, including the activation of intracellular second-messenger systems that mediate the cell's response to that stimulus. However, hydrophobic messengers, such as steroid hormones and some vitamins, can diffuse across the plasma membrane and interact with cytosolic or nuclear receptors. Indeed, cells use a number of intersecting intracellular signaling pathways to ensure that the cell's response to a stimulus is tightly controlled.

## MECHANISMS OF CELLULAR COMMUNICATION

## Cells can communicate with one another via chemical signals

Cells secrete chemical signals that can induce a physiological response in any (or all) of three ways (Fig. 3-1): by entering the circulation and acting on distant tissues (endocrine), by acting on a neighboring cell in the same tissue (paracrine), or by stimulating the same cell that released the chemical (autocrine). Secreted factors that are produced by cells of one organ and enter the circulation to induce a response in a separate organ are called hormones, and the organs that secrete them-such as the pituitary, adrenal, and thyroid glands-are parts of the endocrine system. However, many other cells and tissues not classically thought of as endocrine in nature also produce hormones. For example, the kidney produces 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$, and the salivary gland synthesizes nerve growth factor. Finally, physical contact between one cell and another, or between a cell and the
matrix secreted by another cell, can transmit a signal (juxtacrine).

For paracrine and autocrine signals to be delivered to their proper targets, their diffusion must be limited. This restriction can be accomplished by rapid endocytosis of the chemical signal by neighboring cells, its destruction by extracellular enzymes, or its immobilization by the extracellular matrix. The events that take place at the neuromuscular junction are excellent examples of paracrine signaling. When an electrical impulse travels down an axon and reaches the nerve terminal (Fig. 3-2), it stimulates release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine ( ACh ). In turn, ACh transiently activates a ligand-gated cation channel on the muscle cell membrane. The resultant transient influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$causes the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ to shift locally in a positive direction (i.e., depolarization), initiating events that result in propagation of an action potential along the muscle cell. The ACh signal is rapidly terminated by the action of acetylcholinesterase, which is present in the synaptic cleft. This enzyme degrades the ACh that is released by the neuron.

## Soluble chemical signals interact with target cells via binding to surface or intracellular receptors

Four types of chemicals can serve as extracellular signaling molecules:

1. Amines, such as epinephrine
2. Peptides and proteins, such as angiotensin II and insulin
3. Steroids, including aldosterone, estrogens, and retinoic acid
4. Other small molecules, such as amino acids, nucleotides, ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), and gases (e.g., nitric oxide)

For a molecule to act as a signal, it must bind to a receptor. Most receptors are proteins on the cell surface or within the cell that specifically bind a signaling molecule (the ligand) and induce a cellular response by interacting with an effector. In some cases, the receptor is itself the effector, as in ligand-gated ion channels that alter transmembrane ion conductance in response to an extracellular signal. In most cases, however, interaction of the ligand with its receptor results in association of the receptor with one or more intracellular effector molecules that in turn initiate the cellular response. Effectors include enzymes, channels, transport proteins, contractile elements, and transcription factors. The

Figure 3-2 Example of paracrine signaling. The release of ACh at the neuromuscular junction is a form of paracrine signaling because the nerve terminal releases a chemical (i.e., ACh) that acts on a neighboring cell (i.e., the muscle).
ability of a cell or tissue to respond to a specific signal is dictated by the complement of receptors it possesses and by the chain of intracellular reactions that are initiated by the binding of any one ligand to its receptor. Receptors can be divided into five categories on the basis of their mechanisms of signal transduction (Table 3-1).

1. Ligand-gated ion channels. Integral membrane proteins, these hybrid receptors/channels are involved in signaling between electrically excitable cells. The binding of a neurotransmitter such as ACh to its receptor-which in fact is merely part of the channel-results in transient opening of the channel and thus alters the ion permeability of the cell.
2. G protein-coupled receptors. These integral plasmamembrane proteins work indirectly-through multiple intermediaries-to activate or inactivate downstream effectors, such as membrane-associated enzymes or channels. This group of receptors is named for the initial intermediary, which is a heterotrimeric GTP-binding complex called a G protein.
3. Catalytic receptors. When activated by a ligand, these integral plasma-membrane proteins are either enzymes themselves or part of an enzymatic complex. In many cases, these receptors are either kinases that add phosphate groups to their substrates or phosphatases that remove substrate phosphate groups.
4. Nuclear receptors. These proteins, located in the cytosol or nucleus, are ligand-activated transcription factors. These receptors link extracellular signals to gene transcription.
5. Receptors that undergo cleavage. In response to ligand binding, some transmembrane proteins undergo regulated intramembranous proteolysis (RIP; see pp. 87-88), 1 N3-1 which liberates one or more fragments of their cytosolic domain that signal a cellular response by entering the nucleus to modulate gene expression.

Signaling events initiated by membrane-associated receptors can generally be divided into six steps:

Step 1: Recognition of the signal by its receptor. The same signaling molecule can sometimes bind to more than one kind of receptor. For example, ACh can bind to both ligand-gated channels and G protein-coupled receptors. Binding of a ligand to its receptor involves the same three types of weak, noncovalent interactions that characterize substrate-enzyme interactions. Ionic bonds are formed between groups of opposite charge. In van der Waals interactions, a transient dipole in one atom generates the opposite dipole in an adjacent atom and thereby creates an electrostatic interaction. Hydrophobic interactions occur between nonpolar groups.

# N3-1 Examples of RIP 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

In addition to sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) noted in the text on pp. 87-88, other proteins that undergo RIP are Notch and APP-all span the membrane at least once.

Notch is a plasma-membrane receptor whose cytoplasmic domain is released in response to Delta, a membrane-bound ligand that regulates cell fate during development.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a protein of unknown function that is cleaved in the membrane to produce the extracellular amyloid $\beta$ peptide implicated in Alzheimer disease. For Notch and APP, the intramembrane cleavage does not take place until a primary cleavage event removes the bulk of the protein on the extracytoplasmic face. Although the cleaved sites differ in these proteins, the net effect of the first step is to shorten the extracytoplasmic domain to <30 amino acids, which allows the second cleavage to release a portion of the cytoplasmic domain.

The epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel ENaC-a heterotrimer that consists of $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits-also undergoes intramembrane proteolysis. While the ENaC is still in the vesicular subcompartment of the secretory pathway, the protease furin cleaves the extracellular domain of the $\alpha$ subunit twice (after consensus RXXR motifs), releasing a peptide of 26 amino acids. By itself, this modification increases the open probability of ENaC to $\sim 0.30$. Furin also cleaves the $\gamma$ subunit, but only once. A variety of extracellular proteases-including prostasin, elastase, and plasmin-can make a second cut after the protein has reached the plasma membrane. The result of the $\gamma$-subunit cleavages is to increase the open probability to nearly 1.0. Thus, both examples of proteolysis greatly increase the activity of the channel.

Step 2: Transduction of the extracellular message into an intracellular signal or second messenger. Ligand binding causes a conformational change in the receptor that triggers the catalytic activities intrinsic to the receptor or causes the receptor to interact with membrane or cytoplasmic enzymes. The final consequence is the generation of a second messenger or the activation of a catalytic cascade.

Step 3: Transmission of the second messenger's signal to the appropriate effector. The second messenger can be amplified and transmitted to distant regions within the cell by myriad events, such as activation of intracellular kinases and phosphatases that alter the activity of other enzymes and proteins, release or sequestration of intracellular ions, or regulation of metabolic pathways that generate ATP.

Step 4: Modulation of the effector. These effectors represent a diverse array of molecules, such as enzymes, ion channels, cytoskeletal components, and transcription factors. The second message can modulate their expression or activity as well as alter their location or substrate availability.
Step 5: Response of the cell to the initial stimulus. This collection of actions represents the summation and integration of input from multiple signaling pathways.
Step 6: Termination of the response by feedback mechanisms at any or all levels of the signaling pathway.

## Cells can also communicate by direct interactions-juxtacrine signaling

Gap Junctions Neighboring cells can be electrically and metabolically coupled by means of gap junctions formed by the interaction of connexins in two closely apposed cell membranes (see pp. 158-159). These waterfilled channels facilitate the passage of inorganic ions and small molecules, such as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and cyclic $3^{\prime}, 5^{\prime}$-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), from the cytoplasm of one cell into the cytoplasm of an adjacent cell. Mammalian gap junctions permit the passage of molecules that are less than $\sim 1200 \mathrm{Da}$ but restrict the movement of molecules that are greater than $\sim 2000 \mathrm{Da}$. Gap junctions are also excellent pathways for the flow of electrical current between adjacent cells, playing a critical role in cardiac and smooth muscle.

The permeability of gap junctions can be rapidly regulated by changes in cytosolic concentrations of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, cAMP, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as well as by the voltage across the cell membrane or $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. This type of modulation is physiologically important for cell-to-cell communication. For example, if a cell's plasma membrane is damaged, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ passively moves into the cell and raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, to toxic levels. Elevated intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in the damaged cell triggers closure of the gap junctions, which prevents the flow of excessive amounts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the adjacent cell.

Adhering and Tight Junctions Adhering junctions form as the result of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent interactions of the extracellular domains of transmembrane proteins called cadherins (see p. 17). The clustering of cadherins at the site of interaction with an adjacent cell causes secondary clustering of intracellular proteins known as catenins, which in turn serve as sites of attachment for the intracellular actin cytoskeleton. Thus, adhering junctions provide important clues for the maintenance of normal cell architecture as well as the organization of groups of cells into tissues.

In addition to playing a homeostatic role, adhering junctions can serve a signaling role during organ development and remodeling. In a cell that is stably associated with its neighbors, a catenin known as $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-catenin is mainly sequestered at the adhering junctions, so that the concentration of free $\beta$-catenin is minimized. However, disruption of adhering junctions following stimulation by certain growth factors, for example, causes $\beta$-catenin to disassociate from cadherin. The resulting rise in free $\beta$-catenin levels promotes the translocation of $\beta$-catenin to the nucleus. There, $\beta$-catenin regulates the transcription of multiple
genes, including ones that promote cell proliferation and migration. (5) N3-2

Similar to adhering junctions, tight junctions (see pp. 43-44) comprise transmembrane proteins that link with their counterparts on adjacent cells as well as intracellular proteins that both stabilize the complex and have a signaling role. The transmembrane proteins-including claudins, occludin, and junctional adhesion molecule (JAM)—and their extracellular domains create the diffusion barrier of the tight junction. One of the integral cytoplasmic proteins in tight junctions, zonula occludin 1 (ZO-1), colocalizes with a serine/threonine kinase known as WNK1. (5) N3-3 which is found in certain renal tubule epithelial cells that reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from the tubule lumen. By phosphorylating specific claudins in the tight-junction complex, WNK1 determines the paracellular $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$permeability and thereby helps regulate NaCl uptake from the glomerular filtrate. Mutations in WNK1 that increase the movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ through the tight junctions (see pp. 754-755) cause increased salt reabsorption by the kidney and lead to hypertension.

Membrane-Associated Ligands Another mechanism by which cells can directly communicate is the interaction of a receptor in the plasma membrane with a ligand that is itself a membrane protein on an adjacent cell. Such membraneassociated ligands can provide spatial clues in migrating cells. For example, an ephrin ligand expressed on the surface of one cell can interact with an Eph receptor on a nearby cell. The resulting activation of the Eph receptor can in turn provide signals for regulating such developmental events as axonal guidance in the nervous system and endothelial-cell guidance in the vasculature.

Ligands in the Extracellular Matrix Cells also receive input from their extracellular environment via cell-surface receptors that interact with the extracellular matrix. These receptors, called integrins (see p. 17), have an extracellular domain that interacts with amino-acid sequences that are specific to certain matrix components, such as collagen, fibronectin, and laminin. This ligand-receptor interaction results in a conformational change in the integrin that promotes the accumulation of a cluster of signaling molecules-called a focal adhesion-on the cytosolic side of the membrane. The focal adhesion includes small GTP-binding proteins (see p. 56) such as Rac and Rho that regulate actin cytoskeletal anchoring and turnover, as well as intracellular kinases such as focal-adhesion kinase (FAK) and Src that control such diverse processes as cell proliferation, cell migration, and cell differentiation. Thus, by sensing a change in the matrix composition, cells can activate migratory responses needed for organ repair or can undergo terminal differentiation during organ development.

## Second-messenger systems amplify signals and integrate responses among cell types

Once a signal has been received at the cell surface, it is typically amplified and transmitted to specific sites within the cells via second messengers. For a molecule to function as a second messenger, its concentration, activation, and location must be finely regulated. The cell achieves this control by

## N3-2 $\beta$-Catenins

## Contributed by Lloyd Cantley

The concentration of free $\beta$-catenin in the cytoplasm is regulated by a cluster of cytosolic proteins (including the adenomatous polyposis coli [APC] protein that is mutated in some colon cancers) that bind and phosphorylate $\beta$-catenin, targeting it for degradation. Thus, inhibition of this regulatory pathway, such as occurs following activation of Wnt signaling during organ development, will increase $\beta$-catenin levels and enhance nuclear localization and transcriptional regulation.

## N3-3 WNK Kinases

## Contributed by Lloyd Cantley

WNK kinases are serine/threonine kinases that are unique in that they lack an otherwise highly conserved lysine residue in the catalytic domain (specifically, subdomain II) of the enzyme. Hence, they are kinases "with no $K$ "-that is, no lysine residue (the single-letter code for lysine is $K$ ). These kinases have emerged as highly important regulators of epithelial ion transport in the kidney, predominantly via phosphorylation-dependent changes in ion channel surface localization and activity.

rapidly producing or activating the second messenger and then inactivating or degrading it. To ensure that the system returns to a resting state when the stimulus is removed, counterbalancing activities function at each step of the cascade.

The involvement of second messengers in catalytic cascades provides numerous opportunities to amplify a signal. For example, the binding of a ligand to its receptor can generate hundreds of second-messenger molecules, which can in turn alter the activity of thousands of downstream effectors. This modulation usually involves the conversion of an inactive species into an active molecule or vice versa. An example of creating an active species would be G proteins that elicit the formation of the second messenger cAMP (see pp. 56-57), whereas an example of destroying an active species would be G proteins that elicit the breakdown of a related second messenger, cGMP; (see p. 58).

Second-messenger systems also allow both specificity and diversity. Distinct ligand-receptor combinations that activate the same intracellular signaling pathways often produce the same cellular response. For example, epinephrine, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), glucagon, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) all signal via cAMP to induce triacylglycerol breakdown. In contrast, a single signaling molecule can produce distinct responses in different cells, depending on the complement of receptors and signaltransduction pathways that are available in the cell as well as the specialized function that the cell carries out in the organism. For example, ACh stimulates contraction of skeletal muscle cells, inhibits contraction of heart muscle cells, and facilitates the exocytosis of secretory granules by pancreatic acinar cells. This signaling molecule achieves these different end points by interacting with distinct receptors on each cell. Finally, even within a single cell, a second messenger such as cAMP can act within microdomains to target a specific set of effector molecules, thereby conferring spatially based specificity. (1) N3-4

The diversity and specialization of second-messenger systems are important to a multicellular organism, as can be seen in the coordinated response of an organism to a stressful situation. Under these conditions, the adrenal gland releases epinephrine. Different organ systems respond to epinephrine in a distinct manner, such as activation of glycogen breakdown in the liver, constriction of the blood vessels of the skin, dilation of the blood vessels in skeletal muscle, dilation of airways in the lung, and increased rate and force of heart contraction. The overall effect is an integrated response that readies the organism for attack, defense, or escape. In contrast, complex cell behaviors, such as proliferation and differentiation, are generally stimulated by combinations of signals rather than by a single signal. Integration of these stimuli requires crosstalk among the various signaling cascades.

As discussed below, most signal-transduction pathways use elaborate cascades of signaling proteins to relay information from the cell surface to effectors in the cell membrane, the cytoplasm, or the nucleus. In Chapter 4, we discuss how signal-transduction pathways that lead to the nucleus can affect the cell by modulating gene transcription. These are genomic effects. Signal-transduction systems that project to
the cell membrane or to the cytoplasm produce nongenomic effects, the focus of this chapter.

## RECEPTORS THAT ARE ION CHANNELS

## Ligand-gated ion channels transduce a chemical signal into an electrical signal

The property that defines the ligand-gated ion channel class of multisubunit membrane-spanning receptors is that the signaling molecule itself controls the opening and closing of an ion channel by binding to a site on the receptor. Thus, these receptors are also called ionotropic receptors to distinguish them from the metabotropic receptors, which act via "metabolic" pathways. One superfamily of ligand-gated channels includes the ionotropic receptors for ACh , serotonin, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine. Most structural and functional information for ionotropic receptors comes from the nicotinic ACh receptor (AChR) present in skeletal muscle (see Fig. 8-7). The nicotinic AChR is a cation channel that consists of four membrane-spanning subunits, $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ or $\varepsilon$, and $\delta$, in a stoichiometry of $2: 1: 1: 1$. This receptor is called nicotinic because the nicotine contained in tobacco can activate or open the channel and thereby alter $V_{m}$. Note that the nicotinic AChR is very different from the muscarinic AChR discussed below, which is not a ligand-gated channel. Additional examples of ligand-gated channels are the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ receptor and the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel (also known as the ryanodine receptor). Both receptors are tetrameric $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels located in the membranes of intracellular organelles.

## RECEPTORS COUPLED TO G PROTEINS

G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) constitute the largest family of receptors on the cell surface, with $>1000$ members either known or predicted from genome sequences. GPCRs mediate cellular responses to a diverse array of signaling molecules, such as hormones, neurotransmitters, vasoactive peptides, odorants, tastants, and other local mediators. Despite the chemical diversity of their ligands, most receptors of this class have a similar structure (Fig. 3-3). They consist of a single polypeptide chain with seven membranespanning $\alpha$-helical segments, an extracellular N terminus that is glycosylated, a large cytoplasmic loop that is composed mainly of hydrophilic amino acids between helices 5 and 6 , and a hydrophilic domain at the cytoplasmic C terminus. Most small ligands (e.g., epinephrine) bind in the plane of the membrane at a site that involves several membrane-spanning segments. In the case of larger protein ligands, a portion of the extracellular N terminus also participates in ligand binding. The 5,6-cytoplasmic loop appears to be the major site of interaction with the intracellular G protein, although the 3,4-cytoplasmic loop and the cytoplasmic C terminus also contribute to binding in some cases. Binding of the GPCR to its extracellular ligand regulates this interaction between the receptor and the G proteins, thus transmitting a signal to downstream effectors. In the next four sections of this subchapter, we discuss the general

# N3-4 Compartmentalization of Second-Messenger Effects 

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

In the textbook, we referred only to whole-cell levels of intracellular second messengers (e.g., cAMP), as if these messengers were uniformly distributed throughout the cell. However, some cell physiologists and cell biologists believe that local effects of intracellular second messengers may be extremely important in governing how signal-transduction processes work. One piece of evidence for such local effects is that the receptors for hormones and other extracellular agonists often are a part of macromolecular clusters of proteins that share a common physiological role. For example, a hormone receptor, its downstream heterotrimeric G protein, an amplifying enzyme (e.g., adenylyl cyclase) that generates the intracellular second messenger (e.g. cAMP), other proteins (e.g., the A kinase anchoring protein [or AKAP]), and the effector molecule (e.g., protein kinase A) may all reside in a microdomain at the cell membrane. Thus, it is possible that a particular hormone could act by locally raising [cAMP], to levels much higher than in neighboring areas, so that-of all the cellular proteins potentially sensitive to cAMP-only a local subset of these targets may be activated by the newly formed cAMP.

A second piece of evidence for the local effects of cAMP is the wide distribution of phosphodiesterases, which would be expected to break down cAMP and limit its ability to spread throughout the cell.

principles of how G proteins function and then consider three major second-messenger systems that G proteins trigger.

## GENERAL PROPERTIES OF G PROTEINS

## G proteins are heterotrimers that exist in many combinations of different $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits

G proteins are members of a superfamily of GTP-binding proteins. This superfamily includes the classic heterotrimeric G proteins that bind to GPCRs as well as the so-called small GTP-binding proteins, such as Ras. Both the heterotrimeric and small G proteins can hydrolyze GTP and switch between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDPbound state.

Heterotrimeric G proteins are composed of three subunits, $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$. At least 16 different $\alpha$ subunits ( $\sim 42$ to $50 \mathrm{kDa}), 5 \beta$ subunits ( $\sim 33$ to 35 kDa ), and $11 \gamma$ subunits ( $\sim 8$ to 10 kDa ) are present in mammalian tissue. The $\alpha$ subunit binds and hydrolyzes GTP and also interacts with "downstream" effector proteins such as adenylyl cyclase. Historically, the $\alpha$ subunits were thought to provide the principal specificity to each type of G protein, with the $\beta \gamma$ complex functioning to anchor the trimeric complex to the membrane. However, it is now clear that the $\beta \gamma$ complex also functions in signal transduction by interacting with effector molecules distinct from those regulated by the $\alpha$ subunits. Moreover, both the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ subunits are involved in anchoring the complex to the membrane. The $\alpha$ subunit is held to the membrane by either a myristyl or a palmitoyl group, whereas the $\gamma$ subunit is held via a prenyl group.

The multiple $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits demonstrate distinct tissue distributions and interact with different receptors and effectors (Table 3-2). Because of the potential for several hundred combinations of the known $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits, G proteins are ideally suited to link a diversity of receptors to

## B0X 3-1 Action of Toxins on Heterotrimeric G Proteins

Infectious diarrheal disease has a multitude of causes. Cholera toxin, a secretory product of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae, is responsible in part for the devastating characteristics of cholera. The toxin is an oligomeric protein composed of one A subunit and five B subunits $\left(\mathrm{AB}_{3}\right)$. After cholera toxin enters intestinal epithelial cells, the A subunit separates from the B subunits and becomes activated by proteolytic cleavage. The resulting active A1 fragment catalyzes the ADP ribosylation of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$. This ribosylation, which involves transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from the oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD ${ }^{+}$) to the $\alpha$ subunit, inhibits the GTPase activity of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$. As a result of this modification, $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ remains in its activated, GTP-bound form and can activate adenylyl cyclase. In intestinal epithelial cells, the constitutively activated $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ elevates levels of cAMP, which causes an increase in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance and water flow and thereby contributes to the large fluid loss characteristic of this disease.

A related bacterial product is pertussis toxin, which is also an $\mathrm{AB}_{3}$ protein. It is produced by Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough. Pertussis toxin ADPribosylates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$. This ADP-ribosylated $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ cannot exchange its GDP (inactive state) for GTP. Thus, $\alpha_{s}$ remains in its GDPbound inactive state. As a result, receptor occupancy can no longer release the active $\alpha_{s}$-GTP, so adenylyl cyclase cannot be inhibited. Thus, both cholera toxin and pertussis toxin increase the generation of cAMP.
a diversity of effectors. The many classes of G proteins, in conjunction with the presence of several receptor types for a single ligand, provide a mechanism whereby a common signal can elicit the appropriate physiological response in different tissues. For example, when epinephrine binds $\beta_{1}$ adrenergic receptors in the heart, it stimulates adenylyl cyclase, which increases heart rate and the force of contraction. However, in the periphery, epinephrine acts on $\alpha_{2}$ adrenergic receptors coupled to a G protein that inhibits adenylyl cyclase, thereby increasing peripheral vascular resistance and consequently increasing venous return and blood pressure.

Among the first effectors found to be sensitive to G proteins was the enzyme adenylyl cyclase. The heterotrimeric G protein known as $\mathbf{G}$, was so named because it stimulates adenylyl cyclase. A separate class of G proteins was given the name $\mathbf{G}$, because it is responsible for the ligand-dependent inhibition of adenylyl cyclase. Identification of these classes of G proteins was greatly facilitated by the observation that the $\alpha$ subunits of individual G proteins are substrates for ADP ribosylation catalyzed by bacterial toxins. The toxin from Vibrio cholerae activates $\mathrm{G}_{o}$, whereas the toxin from Bordetella pertussis inactivates the cyclase-inhibiting $G_{i}$ (Box 3-1).

For their work in identifying G proteins and elucidating the physiological role of these proteins, Alfred Gilman and Martin Rodbell received the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (3) N3-5

## G-protein activation follows a cycle

In their inactive state, heterotrimeric G proteins are a complex of $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits in which GDP occupies the guanine nucleotide-binding site of the $\alpha$ subunit. After ligand binding to the GPCR (Fig. 3-4, step 1), a conformational change in the receptor-G protein complex facilitates the release of bound GDP and simultaneous binding of GTP to the $\alpha$ subunit (see Fig. 3-4, step 2). This GDP-GTP exchange stimulates dissociation of the complex from the receptor (see Fig. 3-4, step 3) and causes disassembly of the trimer into a free GTP-bound $\alpha$ subunit and separate $\beta \gamma$ complex (see Fig. 3-4, step 4). The GTP-bound $\alpha$ subunit interacts in the plane of the membrane with downstream effectors such as adenylyl cyclase and phospholipases (see Fig. 3-4, step 5), or cleavage of its myristoyl or palmitoyl group can release the $\alpha$ subunit from the membrane. Similarly, the $\beta \gamma$ subunit can activate ion channels or other effectors.

The $\alpha$ subunit is itself an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP and inorganic phosphate ( $\mathrm{P}_{i}$ ). The result is an inactive $\alpha$-GDP complex that dissociates from its downstream effector and reassociates with a $\beta \gamma$ subunit (see Fig. 3-4, step 6); this reassociation terminates signaling and brings the system back to resting state (see Fig. 3-4, step 1). The $\beta \gamma$ subunit stabilizes $\alpha$-GDP and thereby substantially slows the rate of GDP-GTP exchange (see Fig. 3-4, step 2) and dampens signal transmission in the resting state.

The RGS (for "regulation of G-protein signaling") family of proteins appears to enhance the intrinsic GTPase activity of some but not all $\alpha$ subunits. Investigators have identified at least 19 mammalian RGS proteins and shown that they interact with specific $\alpha$ subunits. RGS proteins promote GTP hydrolysis and thus the termination of signaling.

## Activated $\alpha$ subunits couple to a variety of downstream effectors, including enzymes and ion channels

Activated $\alpha$ subunits can couple to a variety of enzymes. A major enzyme that acts as an effector downstream of activated $\alpha$ subunits is adenylyl cyclase (Fig. 3-5A), which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. This enzyme can be either activated or inhibited by G-protein signaling, depending on whether it associates with the GTP-bound form of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ (stimulatory) or $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{i}}$ (inhibitory). Thus, different ligands-acting through different combinations of GPCRs and G proteins-can have opposing effects on the same intracellular signaling pathway. (5) N3-4

G proteins can also activate enzymes that break down cyclic nucleotides. For example, the G protein called transducin contains an $\alpha_{s}$ subunit that activates the cGMP phosphodiesterase, which in turn catalyzes the breakdown of cGMP to GMP (see Fig. 3-5B). This pathway plays a key role in phototransduction in the retina (see p. 368).

G proteins can also couple to phospholipases. These enzymes catabolize phospholipids, as discussed in detail below in the section on G-protein second messengers.

A G PROTEINS ACTING VIA ADENYLYL CYCLASE
![bo414543376c](bo414543376c.jpg)

Figure 3-5 Downstream effects of activated G-protein $\alpha$ subunits. A, When a ligand binds to a receptor coupled to $\alpha_{o}$, adenylyl cyclase ( AC ) is activated, whereas when a ligand binds to a receptor coupled to $\alpha_{c}$ the enzyme is inhibited. The activated enzyme converts ATP to cAMP, which then can activate PKA. B, In phototransduction, a photon interacts with the receptor and activates the G protein transducin. The $\alpha_{r}$ activates phosphodiesterase (PDE), which in turn hydrolyzes cGMP; this lowers the intracellular concentrations of cGMP and therefore closes the cGMP-activated channels. C, In this example, the ligand binds to a receptor that is coupled to $\alpha_{o}$, which activates PLC. This enzyme converts $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG. The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ leads to the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, whereas the DAG activates PKC.

This superfamily of phospholipases can be grouped into phospholipases $\mathrm{A}_{2}, \mathrm{C}$, or D on the basis of the site at which the enzyme cleaves the phospholipid. G proteins that include the $\alpha_{s}$ subunit activate phospholipase C, which breaks phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate into two intracellular messengers, membrane-associated diacylglycerol and cytosolic $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ (see Fig. 3-5C). Diacylglycerol stimulates protein kinase C, whereas $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ binds to a receptor on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane and triggers the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores.

Some G proteins interact with ion channels. Agonists that bind to the $\beta$ adrenergic receptor activate the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (see pp. 190-193) in the heart and skeletal muscle. The $\alpha$ subunit of the G protein G, binds to and directly stimulates L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and also indirectly stimulates this channel via a signal-transduction cascade that involves cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of the channel.

## $\beta \gamma$ subunits can activate downstream effectors

Following activation and disassociation of the heterotrimeric G protein, $\beta \gamma$ subunits can also interact with downstream effectors. The neurotransmitter ACh released from the vagus nerve reduces the rate and strength of heart contraction. This action in the atria of the heart is mediated by muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{2} \mathrm{AChRs}$, members of the GPCR family (see p. 341). These receptors can be activated by muscarine, an alkaloid found in certain poisonous mushrooms. Muscarinic AChRs are very different from the nicotinic AChRs discussed above, which are ligand-gated ion channels. Binding of ACh to the muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptor in the atria activates a heterotrimeric G protein, which results in the generation of both activated $\mathrm{G} \alpha$, as well as a free $\beta \gamma$ subunit complex. The $\beta \gamma$ complex then interacts with a particular class of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, increasing their permeability. This increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability keeps the membrane potential relatively negative and thus renders the cell more resistant to excitation. The $\beta \gamma$ subunit complex also modulates the activity of adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C and stimulates phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. Such effects of $\beta \gamma$ can be independent of, synergize with, or antagonize the action of the $\alpha$ subunit. For example, studies using various isoforms of adenylyl cyclase have demonstrated that purified $\beta \gamma$ stimulates some isoforms, inhibits others, and has no effect on still others. Different combinations of $\beta \gamma$ isoforms may have different activities. For example, $\beta_{1} \gamma_{1}$ is one tenth as efficient at stimulating type II adenylyl cyclase as is $\beta_{1} \gamma_{2}$.

Some $\beta \gamma$ complexes can bind to a special protein kinase called the $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ adrenergic receptor kinase ( $\boldsymbol{\beta A R K}$ ). As a result of this interaction, $\beta A R K$ translocates to the plasma membrane, where it phosphorylates the ligand-receptor complex (but not the unbound receptor). This phosphorylation results in the recruitment of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-arrestin to the GPCR, which in turn mediates disassociation of the receptor-ligand complex and thus attenuates the activity of the same $\beta$ adrenergic receptors that gave rise to the $\beta \gamma$ complex in the first place. This action is an example of receptor desensitization. These phosphorylated receptors eventually undergo endocytosis, which transiently reduces the number of receptors that are available on the cell surface. This endocytosis is an important step in resensitization of the receptor system.

## Small GTP-binding proteins are involved in a vast number of cellular processes

A distinct group of proteins that are structurally related to the $\alpha$ subunit of the heterotrimeric G proteins are the small GTP-binding proteins. More than 100 of these have been identified to date, and they have been divided into five groups: Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran families. These $21-\mathrm{kDa}$ proteins can be membrane associated (e.g., Ras) or may translocate between the membrane and the cytosol (e.g., Rho).

The three isoforms of Ras (NRas, HRas, and KRas) relay signals from the plasma membrane to the nucleus via an elaborate kinase cascade (see pp. 89-90), thereby regulating gene transcription. In some tumors, mutation of the genes encoding Ras proteins results in constitutively active Ras. These mutated genes are called oncogenes because the altered Ras gene product promotes the malignant transformation of a cell and can contribute to the development of cancer (oncogenesis). In contrast, Rho family members are primarily involved in rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Rab and Arf regulate vesicle trafficking, whereas Ran regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport.

Similarly to the $\alpha$ subunit of heterotrimeric G proteins, the small GTP-binding proteins switch between an inactive GDP-bound form and an active GTP-bound form. Two classes of regulatory proteins modulate the activity of these small GTP-binding proteins. The first of these includes the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) and neurofibromin (a product of the neurofibromatosis type 1 gene). GAPs increase the rate at which small GTP-binding proteins hydrolyze bound GTP and thus result in more rapid inactivation. Counteracting the activity of GAPs are guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as "son of sevenless" or SOS (see p. 69), which promote the conversion of inactive Ras-GDP to active Ras-GTP. Interestingly, cAMP directly activates several GEFs, such as Epac (exchange protein activated by cAMP); this demonstrates crosstalk between a classical heterotrimeric G-protein signaling pathway and the small Ras-like G proteins.

## G-PROTEIN SECOND MESSENGERS: CYCLIC NUCLEOTIDES

## cAMP usually exerts its effect by increasing the activity of protein kinase A

Activation of $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$-coupled receptors results in the stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, which can cause [cAMP]_{i} to rise 5-fold in $\sim 5$ seconds (see Fig. 3-5A). This sudden rise is counteracted by cAMP breakdown to AMP by cAMP phosphodiesterase. The downstream effects of this increase in [cAMP] depend on the cellular microdomains in which [cAMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$ rises as well as the specialized functions that the responding cell carries out in the organism. For example, in the adrenal cortex, ACTH stimulation of cAMP production results in the secretion of aldosterone and cortisol (see p. 1023); in the kidney, a vasopressin-induced rise in cAMP levels facilitates water reabsorption (see p. 818). Excess cAMP is also responsible for certain pathological conditions, such as cholera (see Box 3-1). Another pathological process associated with

excess cAMP is McCune-Albright syndrome, characterized by a triad of (1) variable hyperfunction of multiple endocrine glands, including precocious puberty in girls; (2) bone lesions; and (3) pigmented skin lesions (café au lait spots). This disorder is caused by a somatic mutation during development that constitutively activates the G-protein $\alpha_{s}$ subunit in a mosaic pattern.
cAMP exerts many of its effects through cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA). This enzyme catalyzes transfer of the terminal phosphate of ATP to specific serine or threonine residues on substrate proteins. PKA phosphorylation sites are present in a multitude of intracellular proteins, including ion channels, receptors, metabolic enzymes, and signaling pathway proteins. Phosphorylation of these sites can influence either the localization or the activity of the substrate. For example, phosphorylation of the $\beta_{2}$ adrenergic receptor by PKA causes receptor desensitization in neurons, whereas phosphorylation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) increases its $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel activity.

To enhance regulation of phosphorylation events, the cell tightly controls the activity of PKA so that the enzyme can respond to subtle-and local-variations in cAMP levels. One important control mechanism is the use of regulatory subunits that constitutively inhibit PKA. In the absence of cAMP, two catalytic subunits of PKA associate with two of these regulatory subunits; the result is a heterotetrameric protein complex that has a low level of catalytic activity (Fig. 3-6). Binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits induces a conformational change that diminishes their affinity for the catalytic subunits, and the subsequent dissociation of the complex results in activation of kinase activity. Not only can PKA activation have the short-term effects noted above, but the free catalytic subunit of PKA can also enter the nucleus, where substrate phosphorylation can activate the transcription of specific PKA-dependent genes (see p. 89). Although most cells use the same catalytic subunit, different regulatory subunits are found in different cell types.
![bo424543376c](bo424543376c.jpg)

Figure 3-6 Activation of PKA by cAMP.

Another mechanism that contributes to regulation of PKA is the targeting of the enzyme to specific subcellular locations. Such targeting promotes the preferential phosphorylation of substrates that are confined to precise locations within the cell. PKA targeting is achieved by the association of a PKA regulatory subunit with an A kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), which in turn binds to cytoskeletal elements or to components of cellular subcompartments. More than 35 AKAPs are known. The specificity of PKA targeting is highlighted by the observation that, in neurons, PKA is localized to postsynaptic densities through its association with AKAP79. This anchoring protein also targets calcineurin-a protein phosphatase-to the same site. This targeting of both PKA and calcineurin to the same postsynaptic site makes it possible for the cell to tightly regulate the phosphorylation state of important neuronal substrates.

The cAMP generated by adenylyl cyclase can interact with effectors other than PKA. For example, olfactory receptors (see pp. 358-359) activate a member of the G, family called $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{olf}}$. The subsequent rise in [cAMP] $\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{i}}$ activates a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 4). $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx through this channel leads to membrane depolarization and the initiation of a nerve impulse.

For his work in elucidating the role played by cAMP as a second messenger in regulating glycogen metabolism (see Fig. 58-9), Earl Sutherland received the 1971 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (3) N3-6 In 1992, Edmond Fischer and Edwin Krebs shared the prize for their part in demonstrating the role of protein phosphorylation in the signaltransduction process. (4) N3-7

This coordinated set of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions has several physiological advantages. First, it allows a single molecule (e.g., cAMP) to regulate a range of enzymatic reactions. Second, it affords a large amplification to a small signal. The concentration of epinephrine needed to stimulate glycogenolysis in muscle is $\sim 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}$. This subnanomolar level of hormone can raise [cAMP] to $\sim 10^{-6} \mathrm{M}$. Thus, the catalytic cascades amplify the hormone signal 10,000 -fold, which results in the liberation of enough glucose to raise blood glucose levels from $\sim 5$ to $\sim 8 \mathrm{mM}$. Although the effects of cAMP on the synthesis and degradation of glycogen are confined to muscle and liver, a wide variety of cells use cAMP-mediated activation cascades in the response to a wide variety of hormones.

## Protein phosphatases reverse the action of kinases

As discussed above, one way that the cell can terminate a cAMP signal is to use a phosphodiesterase to degrade cAMP. In this way, the subsequent steps along the signaling pathway can also be terminated. However, because the downstream effects of cAMP often involve phosphorylation of effector proteins at serine and threonine residues by kinases such as PKA, another powerful way to terminate the action of cAMP is to dephosphorylate these effector proteins. Such dephosphorylation events are mediated by enzymes called serine/ threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases.

Four groups of serine/threonine phosphoprotein phosphatases (PPs) are known: 1, 2a, 2b, and 2c. These enzymes themselves are regulated by phosphorylation at their serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues. The balance between kinase

and phosphatase activity plays a major role in the control of signaling events.

PP1 dephosphorylates many proteins phosphorylated by PKA, including those phosphorylated in response to epinephrine (see Fig. 58-9). Another protein, phosphoprotein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (I-1), can bind to and inhibit PP1. Interestingly, PKA phosphorylates and induces I-1 binding to PP1 (Fig. 3-7), thereby inhibiting PP1 and preserving the phosphate groups added by PKA in the first place.

PP2a, which is less specific than PP1, appears to be the main phosphatase responsible for reversing the action of other protein serine/threonine kinases. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent PP2b, also known as calcineurin, is prevalent in the brain, muscle, and immune cells and is also the pharmacological target of the immunosuppressive reagents FK-506 (tacrolimus) and cyclosporine.

The substrates for PP2c include the DNA checkpoint regulators Chk1 and Chk2, which normally sense DNA damage in the setting of organ injury and temporarily stop cell proliferation. Dephosphorylation of these kinases by PP2c inactivates them and allows the cell to re-enter the cell cycle during the repair process.

In addition to serine/threonine kinases such as PKA, a second group of kinases involved in regulating signaling pathways (discussed beginning on pp. 68-70) are tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate their substrate proteins on tyrosine residues. The enzymes that remove phosphates from these tyrosine residues-phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)-are much more variable than the serine and threonine phosphatases. The first PTP to be characterized was the cytosolic enzyme PTP1B from human placenta. PTP1B has a high degree of homology with CD45, a membrane protein that is both a receptor and a tyrosine phosphatase. The large family of PTPs can be divided into two classes: membrane-spanning receptor-like proteins such as CD45 and cytosolic tyrosine phosphatases such as PTP1B. A number of intracellular PTPs contain Src homology 2 (SH2) domains, a peptide sequence or motif that interacts with
phosphorylated tyrosine groups and thus acts to recruit the phosphatase to its target substrate. Many of the PTPs are themselves regulated by phosphorylation.

## cGMP exerts its effect by stimulating a nonselective cation channel in the retina

cGMP is another cyclic nucleotide that is involved in G-protein signaling events. In the outer segments of rods and cones in the visual system, the G protein does not couple to an enzyme that generates cGMP but, as noted above, couples to an enzyme that breaks it down. As discussed beginning on page 367, light activates a GPCR called rhodopsin, which activates the G protein transducin (see p. 368), which in turn activates the cGMP phosphodiesterase (see p. 368) that lowers [cGMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$. The fall in [cGMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$ closes cGMP-gated nonselective cation channels that are members of the same family of CNG ion channels that cAMP activates in olfactory signaling (see pp. 358-359).

## G-PROTEIN SECOND MESSENGERS: PRODUCTS OF PHOSPHOINOSITIDE BREAKDOWN

## Many messengers bind to receptors that activate phosphoinositide breakdown

Although the phosphatidylinositols (PIs) are minor constituents of cell membranes, they are largely distributed in the internal leaflet of the membrane and play an important role in signal transduction. The inositol sugar moiety of PI molecules (see Fig. 2-2A) can be phosphorylated to yield two major phosphoinositides involved in signal transduction: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathbf{P I}(\mathbf{4 , 5}) \mathbf{P}_{2}\right.$ or $\left.\mathbf{P I P}_{3}\right)$ and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P $\mathbf{P}_{3}$ or PIP $_{3}$; see p. 69). (○) N3-8

Certain membrane-associated receptors act through G proteins (e.g., $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ ) that stimulate phospholipase C (PLC) to cleave $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ into inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (or $\mathrm{P}_{3}$ ) and diacylglycerol (DAG), as shown in Figure 3-8A. PLCs are classified into three families $(\beta, \gamma, \delta)$ that differ in their catalytic properties, cell-type-specific expression, and modes of activation. PLC $\beta$ is typically activated downstream of certain G proteins (e.g., $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ ), whereas $\mathrm{PLC} \gamma$ contains an SH 2 domain and is activated downstream of certain tyrosine kinases. Stimulation of $\mathrm{PLC} \beta$ results in a rapid increase in cytosolic $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ levels as well as an early peak in DAG levels (see Fig. 3-8B). Both products are second messengers. The watersoluble $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ travels through the cytosol to stimulate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores (see next section). DAG remains in the plane of the membrane to activate protein kinase C, which migrates from the cytosol and binds to DAG in the membrane (see pp. 60-61).

Phosphatidylcholines (PCs), which-unlike PI—are an abundant phospholipid in the cell membrane, are also a source of DAG. The cell can produce DAG from PC by either of two mechanisms (see Fig. 3-8C). First, PLC can directly convert PC to phosphocholine and DAG. Second, phospholipase D (PLD), by cleaving the phosphoester bond on the other side of the phosphate, can convert PC to choline and phosphatidic acid (PA; also phospho-DAG). This PA

# N3-8 Acyl Groups 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As noted in the text, phosphatidylinositols (PIs) (see p. 10) and phosphatidylcholines (PCs) (see p. 10) can each contain a variety of acyl groups. Therefore, the phosphoinositides derived from them can also contain a variety of acyl groups.

A phosphoinositide is a PI derivative containing one, two, or three additional phosphate groups. Because there are three possible attachment sites (at sites 3,4 , or 5 ), there are a total of seven combinations possible.

can then be converted to DAG via PA-phosphohydrolase. Production of DAG from PC, either directly (via PLC) or indirectly (via PLD), produces the slow wave of increasing cytosolic DAG shown in Figure 3-8B. Thus, in some systems, the formation of DAG is biphasic and consists of an early peak that is transient and parallels the formation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, followed by a late phase that is slow in onset but sustained for several minutes.

## $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ liberates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores

As discussed on page 126, three major transport mechanisms keep free intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}\right)$ below $\sim 100 \mathrm{nM}$. Increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ from this extremely low baseline allow $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to function as an important second messenger. $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ generated by the metabolism of membrane phospholipids travels through the cytosol and binds to the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor, a ligandgated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 3-8A). The result is a release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores and a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Indeed, it was within this system that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ was first identified as a messenger mediating the stimulus-response coupling of endocrine cells. The $\mathbf{I P}_{3}$ receptor (ITPR) is a tetramer composed of subunits of $\sim 260 \mathrm{kDa}$. At least three genes encode the subunits of the receptor. These genes are subject to alternative splicing, which further increases the potential for receptor diversity. The receptor is a substrate for phosphorylation by protein kinases A and C as well as calcium-calmodulin $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}\right)$-dependent protein kinases. (5) N3-9

Interaction of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ with its receptor results in passive efflux of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the ER and thus a rapid rise in the free cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$-induced changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ exhibit complex temporal and spatial patterns. The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, which can be brief or persistent, can oscillate repetitively or spread across groups of cells coupled by gap junctions. In at least some systems, the frequency of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ oscillations seems to be physiologically important. For example, in isolated pancreatic acinar cells, graded increases in the concentration of ACh produce graded increases in the frequency-but not the magnitude-of repetitive $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ spikes. The mechanisms responsible for $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ oscillations and waves are complex. It appears that both propagation and oscillation depend on positive-feedback mechanisms, in which high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ facilitates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release, as well as on negative-feedback mechanisms, in which high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ inhibits further $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release.

Structurally related to ITPRs are the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels known as ryanodine receptors (RYRs; see p. 230). Because cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activates RYRs, these channels play an important role in elevating $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in certain cells by a process known as calcium-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (CICR; see pp. 242-243)-an example of the positive feedback noted above. For example, RYRs are responsible for releasing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum of muscle and thereby switching on muscle contraction (see pp. 229-230). Moreover, cyclic ADP ribose (cADPR), the product of ADP-ribosylcyclases, increases the sensitivity of RYR to cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thereby augmenting CICR.
$\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ can increase as the result not only of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores, but also of enhanced influx through $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane. By whatever mecha-
nism, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ exerts its effects by binding to cellular proteins and changing their activity, as discussed in the next two sections. Some $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent signaling events are so sensitive to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increase of as little as 100 nM can trigger a vast array of cellular responses. These responses include secretion of digestive enzymes by pancreatic acinar cells, release of insulin by $\beta$ cells, contraction of vascular smooth muscle, conversion of glycogen to glucose in the liver, release of histamine by mast cells, aggregation of platelets, and DNA synthesis and cell division in fibroblasts.

The same mechanisms that normally keep $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ at extremely low levels (see p. 126) are also responsible for reversing the increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ that occur during signaling events. Increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ activate an ATP-fueled Ca pump (SERCA; see p. 118) that begins pumping $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ back into the ER. In addition, a Ca pump (see p. 118) and Na-Ca exchanger (see pp. 123-124) at the plasma membrane extrude excess $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell. These processes are much slower than $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release, so $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ remains high until $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ is dephosphorylated, terminating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release via ITPR and thereby allowing the transporters to restore $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to basal levels.

## Calcium activates calmodulin-dependent protein kinases

How does an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ lead to downstream responses in the signal-transduction cascade? The effects of changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ are mediated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins, the most important of which is calmodulin (CaM). CaM is a highaffinity cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein of 148 amino acids. Each molecule of CaM cooperatively binds four calcium ions. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding induces a major conformational change in CaM that allows it to bind to other proteins (Fig. 3-9). Although CaM does not have intrinsic enzymatic activity, it forms a complex with a number of enzymes and thereby confers a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dependence on their activity. For example, binding of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ complex activates the enzyme that degrades cAMP, cAMP phosphodiesterase.

Many of the effects of CaM occur as the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM complex binds to and activates a family of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM-dependent kinases known as CaM kinases (CaMKs). These kinases phosphorylate specific serine and threonine residues of a variety of proteins. An important CaMK in smooth-muscle cells is myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) (see p. 247). Another CaMK is glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PK), which plays a role in glycogen degradation (see p. 1182).

MLCK, PK, and some other CaMKs have a rather narrow substrate specificity. The ubiquitous CaM kinase II (CaMKII), on the other hand, has a broad substrate specificity. Especially high levels of this multifunctional enzyme are present at the synaptic terminals of neurons. One of the actions of CaMKII is to phosphorylate and thereby activate the rate-limiting enzyme (tyrosine hydroxylase; see Fig. 13-8) in the synthesis of catecholamine neurotransmitters. CaMKII can also phosphorylate itself, which allows it to remain active in the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

## DAGs and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activate protein kinase C

As noted above, hydrolysis of $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$ by PLC yields not only the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ that leads to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from internal stores but also

# N3-9 IP $_{3}$ Receptor Diversity 

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

As noted in the text, the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor (IPTR) is a tetramer composed of subunits of $\sim 260 \mathrm{kDa}$, and at least four different genes encode the receptor subunits. These genes are subject to alternative splicing, further increasing the potential for receptor diversity. $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptors bind their ligand with high affinity (the dissociation constant $K_{D}=2-10 \mathrm{nM}$ ) or low affinity ( $K_{D}=40 \mathrm{nM}$ ). However, the extent to which these different affinities correlate with particular forms of the receptor has not been established.

![bo464543376c](bo464543376c.jpg)

Figure 3-9 $\quad$ CaM. After four intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions bind to CaM , the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM complex can bind to and activate another protein. In this example, the activated protein is a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM-dependent kinase.

DAG (see Fig. 3-8A). The most important function of DAG is to activate protein kinase C (PKC), an intracellular serine/ threonine kinase. In mammals, the PKC family comprises at least 10 members that differ in their tissue and cellular localization. This family is further subdivided into three groups that all require membrane-associated phosphatidylserine but have different requirements for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and DAG. The classical PKC family members PKC $\alpha$, PKC $\beta$, and PKC $\gamma$ require both DAG and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for activation, whereas the novel PKCs (such as PKC $\delta$, PKC $\varepsilon$, and PKC $\eta$ ) require DAG but are independent of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and the atypical PKCs (PKC $\zeta$ and PKC $\lambda$ ) appear to be independent of both DAG and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. As a consequence, the signals generated by the PKC pathway depend on the isoforms of the enzyme that a cell expresses as well as on the levels of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and DAG at specific locations at the cell membrane. Moreover, proteins such as receptor for activated C-kinase (RACK) and receptor for inactivated C-kinase (RICK) can target specific PKC isoforms to specific cellular compartments.

In its basal state, PKC $\alpha$ is an inactive, soluble cytosolic protein. When a GPCR activates PLC, both DAG (generated in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane) and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (released in response to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ ) bind to the PKC regulatory domain; this results in translocation of PKC $\alpha$ to the membrane and activation of the PKC kinase domain. Even though the initial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal is transient, PKC $\alpha$ activation can be sustained, resulting in activation of physiological responses, such as proliferation and differentiation. Elevated levels of active PKC $\alpha$ are maintained by a slow wave of elevated DAG (see Fig. 3-8B), which is due to the hydrolysis of PC by PLC and PLD.

Physiological stimulation of the classical and novel PKCs by DAG can be mimicked by the exogenous application of a class of tumor promoters called phorbol esters. These plant products bind to the regulatory domain of PKCs and thus specifically activate them even in the absence of DAG.

Among the major substrates of PKC are the myristoylated, alanine-rich C-kinase substrate proteins, known as MARCKS proteins. These acidic proteins contain consensus sites for PKC phosphorylation as well as CaM- and actin-binding sites. MARCKS proteins cross-link actin filaments and thus appear to play a role in translating extracellular signals into actin plasticity and changes in cell shape. Unphosphorylated MARCKS proteins are associated with the plasma membrane, and they cross-link actin. Phosphorylation of the MARCKS proteins causes them to translocate into the cytosol, where they are no longer able to cross-link actin. Thus, mitogenic growth factors that activate PKC may produce morphological changes and anchorage-independent cell proliferation in part by modifying the activity of MARCKS proteins.

PKC can also directly or indirectly modulate transcription factors and thereby enhance the transcription of specific genes (see p. 86). Such genomic actions of PKC explain why phorbol esters are tumor promoters.

## G-PROTEIN SECOND MESSENGERS: ARACHIDONIC ACID METABOLITES

In addition to DAG, other hydrolysis products of membrane phospholipids can act as signaling molecules. (○) N3-10 The best characterized of these hydrolysis products is arachidonic acid (AA), which is attached by an ester bond to the second carbon of the glycerol backbone of membrane phospholipids (Fig. 3-10). Phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ initiates the cellular actions of AA by releasing this fatty acid from glycerol-based phospholipids. (○) N3-11 A series of enzymes subsequently convert AA into a family of biologically active metabolites that are collectively called eicosanoids (from the Greek eikosi [20]) because, like AA, they all have 20 carbon atoms. Three major pathways can convert AA into these eicosanoids (Fig. 3-11). In the first pathway, cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes produce thromboxanes (TXs), prostaglandins (PGs), and prostacyclins. In the second pathway, 5-lipoxygenase enzymes produce leukotrienes (LTs) and some hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) compounds. In the third pathway, the epoxygenase enzymes, which are members of the cytochrome P-450 class, produce other HETE compounds as well as cis-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) compounds. These

## N3-10 Platelet-Activating Factor

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Although it is not a member of the arachidonic acid (AA) family, platelet-activating factor (PAF) is an important lipid signaling molecule. PAF is an ether lipid that the cell synthesizes either de novo or by remodeling of a membrane-bound precursor. PAF occurs in a wide variety of organisms and mediates many biological activities. In mammals, PAF is a potent inducer of platelet aggregation and stimulates the chemotaxis and degranulation of neutrophils, thereby facilitating the release of $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ and 5-HETE. PAF is involved in several aspects of allergic reactions; for example, it stimulates histamine release and enhances the secretion of immunoglobulin E, immunoglobulin A, and tumor necrosis factor. Endothelial cells are also an important target of PAF; PAF causes a negative shift of $V_{m}$ in these cells by activating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. PAF also enhances vascular permeability and the adhesion of neutrophils and platelets to endothelial cells.

PAF exerts its effects by binding to a specific receptor on the plasma membrane. A major consequence of PAF binding to its GPCR is formation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and stimulation of a group of MAPKs. PAF acetylhydrolase terminates the action of this signaling lipid.

## N3-11 Phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

Phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PLA}_{2}\right)$ catalyzes the hydrolytic cleavage of glycerol-based phospholipids (see Fig. 2-2A-C) at the second carbon of the glycerol backbone, yielding AA and a lysophospholipid (see Fig. 3-10). Some of the cytosolic PLA $_{2}$ enzymes require $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for activity. In addition, raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ from the physiological level of $\sim 100 \mathrm{nM}$ to $\sim 300 \mathrm{nM}$ facilitates the association of cytoplasmic $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ with cell membranes, where the $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ can be activated by specific G proteins.

Figure 3-10 Release of AA from membrane phospholipids by $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$. AA is esterified to membrane phospholipids at the second carbon of the glycerol backbone. $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ cleaves the phospholipid at the indicated position and releases AA as well as a lysophospholipid.
three enzymes catalyze the stereospecific insertion of molecular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into various positions in AA. The cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases are selectively distributed in different cell types, which further increases the complexity of eicosanoid biology. Eicosanoids have powerful biological activities, including effects on allergic and inflammatory processes, platelet aggregation, vascular smooth muscle, and gastric acid secretion.

## BOX 3-2 Eicosanoid Nomenclature

The nomenclature of the eicosanoids is not as arcane as a might first appear. The numerical subscript 2 (as in $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ ) or 4 (as in $\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$ ) refers to the number of double bonds in the eicosanoid backbone. For example, AA has four double bonds, as do the leukotrienes.

For the cyclooxygenase metabolites, the letter (A to I) immediately preceding the 2 refers to the structure of the 5 -carbon ring that is formed about halfway along the 20 -carbon chain of the eicosanoid. For the leukotrienes, the letters A and $B$ that immediately precede the 4 refer to differences in the eicosanoid backbone. For the cysteinyl leukotrienes, the letter C refers to the full glutathione conjugate (see Fig. 46-8). Removal of glutamate from $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ yields $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and removal of glycine from $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ yields $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$, leaving behind only cysteine.

For 5-HPETE and 5-HETE, the fifth carbon atom (counting the carboxyl group as number 1) is derivatized with a hydroperoxy or hydroxy group, respectively.

## Phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ is the primary enzyme responsible for releasing $A A$

The first step in the phospholipase $\mathbf{A}_{2}\left(\mathbf{P L A}_{2}\right)$ signaltransduction cascade is binding of an extracellular agonist to a membrane receptor (see Fig. 3-11). These receptors include those for serotonin ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{2}$ receptors), glutamate (mGLUR1 receptors), fibroblast growth factor- $\beta$, interferon- $\alpha$ (IFN- $\alpha$ ), IFN- $\beta$, and IFN- $\gamma$. Once the receptor is occupied by its agonist, it can activate a G protein that belongs to the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$ family. The mechanism by which this activated G protein stimulates $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ is not well understood. It does not appear that a G-protein $\alpha$ subunit is involved. The G-protein $\beta \gamma$ dimer may stimulate $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ either directly or via mitogenactivated protein kinases (MAPKs) (see p. 69), which phosphorylates $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ at a serine residue. The result is rapid hydrolysis of phospholipids that contain AA.

In contrast to the direct pathway just mentioned, agonists acting on other receptors may promote AA release indirectly. First, a ligand may bind to a receptor coupled to PLC, which would lead to the release of DAG (see Fig. 3-11). As noted above, DAG lipase can cleave DAG to yield AA and a monoacylglycerol (MAG). Agonists that act via this pathway include dopamine (D2 receptors), adenosine ( $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ receptors), norepinephrine ( $\alpha_{2}$ adrenergic receptors), and serotonin ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{1}$ receptors). Second, any agonist that raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ can promote AA formation because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can stimulate some cytosolic forms of $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$. Third, any signal-transduction pathway that activates MAPK can also enhance AA release because MAPK phosphorylates $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$.

## Cyclooxygenases, lipoxygenases, and epoxygenases mediate the formation of biologically active eicosanoids

Once it is released from the membrane, AA can diffuse out of the cell, be reincorporated into membrane phospholipids, or be metabolized (see Fig. 3-11).

In the first pathway of AA metabolism (see Fig. 3-11), cyclooxygenases (1) N3-12 catalyze the stepwise conversion of AA into the intermediates prostaglandin $\mathrm{G}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGG}_{2}\right)$ and

# N3-12 Cyclooxygenase 

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

Cyclooxygenase catalyzes the stepwise conversion of AA into the intermediates $\mathrm{PGG}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$. Thus, this enzyme is also referred to as prostaglandin H synthetase (PGHS). As noted in Box 3-3, it is the same enzyme that catalyzes both reactions. Cyclooxygenase exists in three isoforms, COX-1 (a transcript of 2.8 kilobases [kb]), COX-2 (a 4.1-kb transcript), and COX-3 (a splice variant of COX-1 that is also known as COX-1b).

![bo484543376c](bo484543376c.jpg)

Figure 3-11 AA signaling pathways. In the direct pathway, an agonist binds to a receptor that activates $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$, which releases AA from a membrane phospholipid (see Fig. 3-10). In one of three indirect pathways, an agonist binds to a different receptor that activates PLC and thereby leads to the formation of DAG and $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, as in Figure 3-8; DAG lipase then releases the AA from DAG. In a second indirect pathway, the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ releases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, which leads to the activation of $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ (see the direct pathway). In a third indirect pathway (not shown), MAPK stimulates $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$. Regardless of its source, the AA may follow any of three pathways to form a wide array of eicosanoids. The cyclooxygenase pathway produces thromboxanes ( $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{TXB}_{2}$ ), prostacyclin (i.e., $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ), and prostaglandins. The 5-lipoxygenase pathway produces 5-HETE and the leukotrienes. The epoxygenase pathway leads to the production of other HETEs and EETs. AACoA, arachidonic-Acid-coenzyme A; ASA, acetylsalicylic acid.

## BOX 3-3 Therapeutic Inhibition of Cyclooxygenase Isoforms

Cyclooxygenase is a bifunctional enzyme that first oxidizes AA to $\mathrm{PGG}_{2}$ through its cyclooxygenase activity and then peroxidizes this compound to $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$. X-ray crystallographic studies of COX-1 reveal that the sites for the two enzymatic activities (i.e., cyclooxygenase and peroxidase) are adjacent but spatially distinct. The cyclooxygenase site is a long hydrophobic channel. Aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) irreversibly inhibits COX-1 by acetylating a serine residue at the top of this channel. Several of the other NSAIDs interact, via their carboxyl groups, with other amino acids in the same region.

COX-1 activation plays an important role in intravascular thrombosis because it leads to $\mathbf{T X A}_{3}$ synthesis by platelets. Inhibition of this process by low-dose aspirin is a mainstay for prevention of coronary thrombosis in patients with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease. However, COX-1 activation is also important for producing the cytoprotective prostanoids $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (a prostaglandin) and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ (a prostacyclin) in the gastric mucosa. It is the loss of these compounds that can lead to the unwanted side effect of gastrointestinal bleeding after long-term aspirin use. (5) N3-15

Inflammatory stimuli induce COX-2 in a number of cell types, and it is inhibition of COX-2 that provides the antiinflammatory actions of high-dose aspirin (a weak COX-2 inhibitor) and other nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as ibuprofen. Because the two enzymes are only $60 \%$ homologous, pharmaceutical companies have now generated compounds that specifically inhibit COX-2, such as celecoxib. COX-2 inhibitors work well as anti-inflammatory agents and have a reduced likelihood of causing gastrointestinal bleeding because they do not inhibit COX-1-dependent prostacyclin production. COX-2 inhibitors have been reported to increase the risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events when they are taken for long periods.
prostaglandin $\mathrm{H}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGH}_{2}\right) . \mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ is the precursor of the other prostaglandins, the prostacyclins and the thromboxanes. As noted in Box 3-3, cyclooxygenase exists in two predominant isoforms, cyclooxygenase 1 (COX-1) and COX-2, as well as the COX-1b spice variant of COX-1. In many cells, COX-1 is expressed in a constitutive fashion, whereas COX-2 levels can be induced by specific stimuli. For example, in monocytes stimulated by inflammatory agents such as interleukin-1 $\beta$ (IL-1 $\beta$ ), only levels of COX-2 increase. These observations have led to the concept that expression of COX-1 is important for homeostatic prostaglandin functions such as platelet aggregation and regulation of vascular tone, whereas upregulation of COX-2 is primarily important for mediating prostaglandin-dependent inflammatory responses. However, as selective inhibitors of COX-2 have become available, it has become clear that this is an oversimplification.

In the second pathway of AA metabolism, 5-lipoxygenase initiates the conversion of AA into biologically active leukotrienes. For example, in myeloid cells, 5-lipoxygenase converts AA to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), (6) N3-13 which is short-lived and rapidly degraded by a peroxidase to the corresponding alcohol 5-HETE. Alternatively, a dehydrase can convert 5-HPETE to
an unstable epoxide, leukotriene $\mathrm{A}_{4}\left(\mathrm{LTA}_{4}\right)$, which can be either further metabolized by $\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$ hydrolase to $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ or coupled ("conjugated") by LTC, synthase to the tripeptide glutathione (see p. 955). This conjugation-via the cysteine residue of glutathione-yields $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$. Enzymes sequentially remove portions of the glutathione moiety to produce $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}, \mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ are the "cysteinyl" leukotrienes; they participate in allergic and inflammatory responses and make up the mixture previously described as the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis.

The third pathway of AA metabolism begins with the transformation of AA by epoxygenase (a cytochrome P-450 oxidase). (5) N3-14 Molecular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is a substrate in this reaction. The epoxygenase pathway converts AA into two major products, HETEs and EETs. Members of both groups display a diverse array of biological activities. Moreover, the cells of different tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, eye, and pituitary) use different biosynthetic pathways to generate different epoxygenase products.

## Prostaglandins, prostacyclins, and thromboxanes (cyclooxygenase products) are vasoactive, regulate platelet action, and modulate ion transport (6) N3-16

The metabolism of $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ to generate selected prostanoid derivatives is cell specific. For example, platelets convert $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ to thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{3}\left(\mathrm{TXA}_{3}\right)$, a short-lived compound that can aggregate platelets, bring about the platelet release reaction, and constrict small blood vessels. In contrast, endothelial cells convert $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ to prostacyclin $\mathrm{I}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGI}_{2}\right)$, which inhibits platelet aggregation and dilates blood vessels. Many cell types convert $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ to prostaglandins. Acting locally in a paracrine or autocrine fashion, prostaglandins are involved in such processes as platelet aggregation, airway constriction, renin release, and inflammation. (5) N3-16 Prostaglandin synthesis has also been implicated in the pathophysiological mechanism of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and inflammatory diseases. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, indomethacin, and naproxen directly target cyclooxygenase. NSAID inhibition of cyclooxygenase is a useful tool in the treatment of inflammation and fever and, at least in the case of aspirin, in the prevention of heart disease.

The diverse cellular responses to prostanoids are mediated by a family of G protein-coupled prostanoid receptors. This family currently has nine proposed members, including receptors for thromboxane/PGH $\mathrm{PGH}_{2}$ (TP), $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ (IP), $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (EP, to $\mathrm{EP}_{4}$ ), $\mathrm{PGD}_{2}$ (DP and CRTH2), and $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 a}$ (FP). These prostanoid receptors signal via $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}, \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}}$, or $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{o}}$ depending on cell type. These in turn regulate intracellular adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53) and phospholipases (see p. 58).

## The leukotrienes (5-lipoxygenase products) play a major role in inflammatory responses

Many lipoxygenase metabolites of AA have a role in allergic and inflammatory diseases (Table 3-3). (5) N3-17 LTB $_{4}$ is produced by inflammatory cells such as neutrophils and macrophages. The cysteinyl leukotrienes including $\mathbf{L T C}_{4}$ and $\mathbf{L T E}_{4}$ are synthesized by mast cells, basophils, and

#### Abstract

Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron Both COX-1 and COX-2 appear to be required for production of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ in the renal glomerulus, a process that is important in maintaining normal glomerular perfusion in the event of decreased renal blood flow. Thus, another risk of cyclooxygenase inhibitors is diminished renal function in patients with heart failure or volume depletion.

Similar to the nonselective cyclooxygenase inhibitors, COX-2 inhibitors have been shown to decrease renal perfusion and increase the risk of hemodynamic acute renal failure in susceptible individuals.

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As shown in Figure 3-11, one pathway of arachidonic-acid (AA) metabolism begins with the transformation of AA by epoxygenase (a cytochrome P-450 oxidase) to two major products: HETEs and EETs. Epoxygenase requires molecular oxygen (i.e., it is an oxidase) and has several required cofactors, including cytochrome P-450 reductase, NADPH/NADP ${ }^{+}$ (reduced/oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate), or NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$(reduced/oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).

## N3-16 Actions of Prostanoids

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

The prostanoids may participate in regulation of the Na-K pump, which plays a central role in salt and water transport in the kidney and the maintenance of ion gradients in all cell types. For example, the inhibition of the Na-K pump produced by IL-1 appears to be mediated by the formation of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$. Indeed, IL-1 stimulates the formation of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, and application of exogenous $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ inhibits Na-K pump activity directly. Moreover, cyclooxygenase blockers prevent the Na-K pump inhibition induced by IL-1. This action on the Na-K pump is not limited to the kidney; AA metabolites also inhibit the pump in the brain.

Prostaglandins also are vasoactive and are important in the regulation of renal blood flow.

# N3-17 Actions of Leukotrienes 

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

$\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}, \mathrm{LTE}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTF}_{4}$ are often referred to as the "cysteinyl leukotrienes" or sometimes as the "peptidyl leukotrienes." As summarized in Figure 3-11, the enzyme glutathione-Stransferase (GST) conjugates $\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$, which is unstable, to the sulfhydryl group of the cysteine in glutathione (glutathione, also abbreviated GSH, is the branched tripeptide Glu-Cys-Gly) to produce $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$. (See page 955 to learn how the liver uses GSH for conjugation reactions.) The enzyme $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$-glutamyl transferase clips off the glutamate residue of $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ to produce $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ (which is conjugated to -Cys-Gly). A dipeptidase clips the dipeptide bond between Cys and Gly to release the terminal Gly as well as $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ (which is conjugated to only the -Cys).

Leukotrienes have multiple effects on the vascular endothelium during inflammation. Various regulatory processes may interact at the level of the small blood vessels to increase the margination (i.e., the attachment to the vessel wall) of subgroups of leukocytes, increase the permeability at the postcapillary venule, and evoke diapedesis (i.e., the migration of the cell through the endothelium) of the adherent leukocytes to create a focus of interstitial inflammation. Each of these steps can be affected by leukotrienes as well as other agents.

The infiltration of leukocytes begins when the cells adhere to the endothelium of the postcapillary venule. Mediators that can increase the adhesiveness of leukocytes include $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ and several of the cysteinyl leukotrienes. Increased vascular permeability,
influenced by the pulling apart of adjacent endothelial cells, can occur in response to $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$. After adherent leukocytes accumulate-and the size of the interendothelial cell pores increases-a stimulus for diapedesis produces an influx of leukocytes into the interstitial space. Once in the interstitial space, the leukocytes come under the influence of $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$, a potent chemotactic factor (i.e., chemical attractant) for neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that phagocytoses invading organisms) and less so for eosinophils (another type of white blood cell). $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ is also chemokinetic (i.e., speeds up chemotaxis) for eosinophils.

In the lungs, the cysteinyl leukotrienes appear to stimulate the secretion of mucus by the bronchial mucosa. Nanomolar concentrations of $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ stimulate the contraction of the smooth muscles of bronchi as well as smaller airways.

Both $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ (generated by a hydrolase from the unstable $\mathrm{LTA}_{4}$ ) and the cysteinyl leukotrienes (i.e., $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ ) act as growth or differentiation factors for a number of cell types in vitro. $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ stimulates myelopoiesis (formation of white blood cells) in human bone marrow, whereas $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ stimulate the proliferation of glomerular epithelial cells in the kidney. Picomolar concentrations of $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ stimulate the differentiation of a particular type of T lymphocytes referred to as competent suppressor or $\mathrm{CD8}^{+}$lymphocytes. Additional immunological regulatory functions that may be subserved by $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ include the stimulation of IFN- $\gamma$ and IL-2 production by T cells.

## BOX 3-4 Role of Leukotrienes in Disease

Since the original description of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis, which is generated during antigenic challenge of a sensitized lung, leukotrienes have been presumed to play a part in allergic disease of the airways (see Table 3-3). The involvement of cells (mast cells, basophils, and eosinophils) that produce cysteinyl leukotrienes $\left(\mathrm{LTC}_{4}\right.$ through $\mathrm{LTF}_{4}$ ) in these pathobiological processes supports this concept. In addition, the levels of $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}, \mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$ are increased in lavage fluid from the nares of patients with allergic rhinitis after the application of specific antigens to the nasal airways. Introducing $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ into the airways as an aerosol (nebulizer concentration of only $10 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ) causes maximal expiratory airflow (a rough measure of airway resistance; see p. 602) to decline by $\sim 30 \%$. This bronchoconstrictor effect is 1000 -fold more potent than that of histamine, the "reference" agonist. Leukotrienes affect both large and small airways; histamine affects relatively smaller airways. Activation of the cysLT1 receptor in mast cells and eosinophils results in the chemotaxis of these cells to sites of inflammation. Because antagonists of the cysLT1 receptor (e.g., montelukast sodium) can partially block these bronchoconstrictive and proinflammatory effects, these agents are useful in the treatment of allergen-induced asthma and rhinitis.

In addition to being involved in allergic disease, several of the leukotrienes are associated with other inflammatory disorders. Synovial fluid from patients with rheumatoid arthritis contains 5-lipoxygenase products. Another example is the skin disease psoriasis. In patients with active psoriasis, $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}, \mathrm{LTC}_{4}$, and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$ have been recovered from skin chambers overlying abraded lesions. Leukotrienes also appear to be involved in inflammatory bowel disease. $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$ and other leukotrienes are generated and released in vitro from intestinal mucosa obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease.
eosinophils, cells that are commonly associated with allergic inflammatory responses such as asthma and urticaria.

The cysteinyl leukotriene receptors cysLT1 and cysLT2 are GPCRs found on airway smooth-muscle cells as well as on eosinophils, mast cells, and lymphocytes. CysLT1, which couples to both pertussis toxin-sensitive and pertussis toxin-insensitive G proteins, mediates phospholipasedependent increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. In the airways, these events produce a potent bronchoconstriction, whereas activation of
the receptor in mast cells and eosinophils causes release of the proinflammatory cytokines histamine and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- $\alpha$ ).

In addition to playing a role in the inflammatory response, the lipoxygenase metabolites can also influence the activity of many ion channels, either directly or by regulating protein kinases. For example, in synaptic nerve endings, lipoxygenase metabolites decrease the excitability of cells by activating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Lipoxygenase products may also regulate secretion. In pancreatic islet cells, free AA generated in response to glucose appears to be part of a negative-feedback loop that prevents excess insulin secretion by inhibiting CaM kinase II.

## The HETEs and EETs (epoxygenase products) tend to enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores and to enhance cell proliferation

The epoxygenase pathway leads to the production of HETEs other than 5-HETE as well as EETs. HETEs and EETs have been implicated in a wide variety of processes, some of which are summarized in Table 3-4. For example, in stimulated mononuclear leukocytes, HETEs enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores and promote cell proliferation. In smoothmuscle cells, HETEs increase proliferation and migration; these AA metabolites may be one of the primary factors involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. In blood vessels, HETEs can be potent vasoconstrictors. EETs enhance the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, increase $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange, and stimulate cell proliferation. In blood vessels, EETs primarily induce vasodilation and angiogenesis, although they have vasoconstrictive properties in the smaller pulmonary blood vessels.

Degradation of the eicosanoids terminates their activity
Inactivation of the products of eicosanoids is an important mechanism for terminating their biological action. In the case of COX products, the enzyme 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial reactions that convert biologically active prostaglandins into their inactive 15-keto metabolites. This enzyme also appears to be active in the catabolism of thromboxanes.

As far as the 5-lipoxygenase products are concerned, the specificity and cellular distribution of the enzymes that metabolize leukotrienes parallel the diversity of the enzymes

involved in their synthesis. For example, 20 -hydrolase-LTB ${ }_{4}$, a member of the P-450 family, catalyzes the $\omega$-oxidation of $\mathrm{LTB}_{4}$, thereby terminating its biological activity. $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ is metabolized through two pathways. One oxidizes the $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$. The other pathway first removes the glutamic acid residue of the conjugated glutathione, which yields $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$, and then removes the glycine residue, which yields $\mathrm{LTE}_{4}$; the latter is readily excreted into the urine.

The metabolic breakdown of the HETE and EET products of epoxygenase (cytochrome P-450) is rapid and complex. The predominant pathway of inactivation appears to be hydrolysis via soluble epoxide hydrolase to form dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acids (DHETs), which themselves can induce biological responses, such as vasodilation. Once formed, DHETs can be excreted intact in the urine or can form conjugates with reduced glutathione (GSH). In addition, both EETs and DHETs can undergo $\beta$-oxidation to form epoxy fatty acids or can be metabolized by cyclooxygenase to generate various prostaglandin analogs.

## RECEPTORS THAT ARE CATALYTIC

A number of hormones and growth factors bind to cellsurface proteins that have-or are associated withenzymatic activity on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

Here we discuss five classes of such catalytic receptors (Fig. 3-12):

1. Receptor guanylyl cyclases catalyze the generation of cGMP from GTP.
2. Receptor serine/threonine kinases phosphorylate serine or threonine residues on cellular proteins
3. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) phosphorylate tyrosine residues on themselves and other proteins.
4. Tyrosine kinase-associated receptors interact with cytosolic (i.e., not membrane-bound) tyrosine kinases.
5. Receptor tyrosine phosphatases cleave phosphate groups from tyrosine groups of cellular proteins.

## The receptor guanylyl cyclase transduces the activity of atrial natriuretic peptide, whereas a soluble guanylyl cyclase transduces the activity of nitric oxide

Receptor (Membrane-Bound) Guanylyl Cyclase Some of the best-characterized examples of a transmembrane protein with guanylyl cyclase activity (see Fig. 3-12A) are the receptors for the natriuretic peptides. ( $\mathbf{N 3 - 1 8}$ These ligands are a family of related small proteins ( $\sim 28$ amino acids) including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), B-type or brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP). For example, in response to atrial and ventricular stretch that occur with intravascular volume expansion, cardiac myocytes release ANP and BNP, which act through receptor guanylyl cyclases. Their action is to relax vascular smooth muscle and dilate blood vessels (see ANP in Table 20-7, and p. 553) as well as to enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion into urine (natriuresis; see p. 843). Both activities contribute to lowering of effective circulating blood volume and thus blood pressure (see pp. 554-555).

Natriuretic peptide receptors NPRA and NPRB are membrane proteins with an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a single membrane-spanning segment (see Fig. 3-12A). The intracellular domain has two consensus catalytic domains for guanylyl cyclase activity. Binding of a natriuretic peptide induces a conformational change in the receptor that causes receptor dimerization and activation. Thus, binding of ANP to its receptor causes the conversion of GTP to cGMP and raises intracellular levels of cGMP. In turn, cGMP activates a cGMP-dependent kinase (PKG or cGK) that phosphorylates proteins at certain serine and threonine residues. In the renal medullary collecting duct, the cGMP generated in response to ANP may act not only via PKG but also by directly modulating ion channels (see p. 768).

Soluble Guanylyl Cyclase In contrast to the receptor guanylyl cyclase, which is activated by ANP, the cytosolic soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) is activated by nitric oxide (NO). This sGC is unrelated to the receptor guanylyl cyclase and contains a heme moiety that binds NO.

NO is a highly reactive, short-lived free radical. This dissolved gas arises from a family of NO synthase (NOS) enzymes that catalyze the reaction

# N3-18 Atrial Natriuretic Peptide 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

Granular inclusions in atrial myocytes, called Palade bodies, contain pro-ANP, the precursor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; also called atrial natriuretic factor, ANF). Pro-ANP, comprising 126 amino acids, is derived from the precursor known as prepro-ANP (151 residues in the human). The converting enzyme corin-a cardiac transmembrane serine protease-cleaves the pro-ANP during or after release from the atria, which yields the inactive N -terminal fragment of 98 residues and the active C-terminal 28-amino-acid peptide called ANP. Release is primarily caused by stretch of the atrial myocytes. Hormones such as angiotensin, endothelins, arginine vasopressin, and glucocorticoid modulate ANP expression and release. It is noteworthy that expression of corin is reduced in heart failure, which blunts the release of ANP in the failing heart. This blunting might contribute to the inappropriate increase of extracellular fluid volume in heart failure.

ANP is a member of the NP (natriuretic peptide) family of peptides. The biological effects of ANP are potent vasodilation, diuresis, natriuresis, and kaliuresis, as well as inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

At least three types of natriuretic peptide receptors (NPRs) exist: NPRA (also called GC-A-GC for guanylyl cyclase), NPRB (also called GC-B), and NPR-C. NPRA and NPRB are receptors
with a single transmembrane domain coupled to a cytosolic guanylyl cyclase (see p. 66). Activation of NPRA or NPRB leads to the intracellular generation of cGMP. In smooth muscle, intracellular cGMP activates the cGMP-dependent protein kinase that phosphorylates MLCK. Phosphorylation of MLCK inactivates MLCK; this leads to the dephosphorylation of myosin light chains, which allows muscle relaxation.

The ANP C-type receptor NPRC is not coupled to a messenger system but serves mainly to clear the natriuretic peptides from the circulation.

The heart, brain, pituitary, and lung synthesize an ANP-like compound termed BNP, originally known as brain natriuretic peptide ( 32 residues in the human). The biological actions of BNP are similar to those of ANP.

The hypothalamus, pituitary, and kidney synthesize C-type natriuretic peptide or CNP, which is highly homologous to ANP and BNP. CNP binds only to NPRB and is only a weak natriuretic but a strong vasodilator.

The kidney also synthesizes an ANP-like natriuretic compound known as urodilatin or URO. URO has four additional amino acids compared to ANP and also binds to the ANP A-type receptor. Its biological effect in the target tissue is also transduced by cGMP.

respectively. Tetrahydrobiopterin is a cofactor. The NOS family includes neuronal or nNOS (NOS1), inducible or iNOS (NOS2), and endothelial or eNOS (NOS3). nNOS and iNOS are soluble enzymes, whereas eNOS is linked to the plasma membrane. The activation of NOS begins as an extracellular agonist (e.g., ACh) binds to a plasmamembrane receptor, triggering the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which binds to cytosolic CaM and then stimulates NOS. In smooth muscle, NO stimulates the sGC, which then converts GTP to cGMP, activating PKG, which leads to smooth-muscle relaxation.

Why NO is so ubiquitous and when its release is important are not known. However, abnormalities of the NO system are involved in the pathophysiological processes of adult respiratory distress syndrome, high-altitude pulmonary edema, stroke, and other diseases. For example, the importance of NO in the control of blood flow had long been exploited unwittingly to treat angina pectoris. Angina is the classic chest pain that accompanies inadequate blood flow to the heart muscle, usually as a result of coronary artery atherosclerosis. Nitroglycerin relieves this pain by spontaneously breaking down and releasing NO, which relaxes the smooth muscles of peripheral arterioles, thereby reducing the work of the heart and relieving the associated pain. Understanding the physiological and pathophysiological roles of NO has led to the introduction of clinical treatments that modulate the NO system. In addition to the use of NO generators for treatment of angina, examples include the use of gaseous NO for treatment of pulmonary edema and inhibitors of cGMP phosphodiesterase (see p. 53) such as sildenafil (Viagra) for treatment of erectile dysfunction.

In addition to acting as a chemical signal in blood vessels, NO generated by iNOS appears to play an important role in the destruction of invading organisms by macrophages and neutrophils. NO generated by nNOS also serves as a neurotransmitter (see pp. 315-317) and may play a role in learning and memory.

The importance of the NO signaling pathway was recognized by the awarding of the 1998 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine to R.F. Furchgott, L.J. Ignarro, and F. Murad for their discoveries concerning NO as a signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system. (○) NO-18A

## Some catalytic receptors are serine/threonine kinases

We have already discussed how activation of various G protein-linked receptors can initiate a cascade that eventually activates kinases (e.g., PKA, PKC) that phosphorylate proteins at serine and threonine residues. In addition, some receptors are themselves serine/threonine kinases-such as

the one for transforming growth factor- $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ )—and are thus catalytic receptors.

The TGF- $\beta$ superfamily includes a large group of cytokines, including five TGF- $\beta \mathrm{s}$, antimüllerian hormone (see p. 1080), as well as the inhibits and activins (see p. 1113), bone morphogenic proteins, and other glycoproteins, all of which control cell growth and differentiation. Members of this family participate in embryogenesis, suppress epithelialcell growth, promote wound repair, and influence immune and endocrine functions. Unchecked TGF- $\beta$ signaling is important in progressive fibrotic disorders (e.g., liver cirrhosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) that result in replacement of normal organ tissue by deposits of collagen and other matrix components.

The receptors for TGF- $\beta$ and related factors are glycoproteins with a single membrane-spanning segment and intrinsic serine/threonine-kinase activity. Receptor types I and II (see Fig. 3-12B) are required for ligand binding and catalytic activity. The type II receptor first binds the ligand, and this binding is followed by the formation of a stable ternary complex of ligand, type II receptor, and type I receptor. After recruitment of the type I receptor into the complex, the type II receptor phosphorylates the type I receptor, thereby activating the serine/threonine kinase activity of the type I receptor. The principal targets of this kinase activity are SMAD proteins, which fall into three groups. (○) N3-19 The largest group is the receptor-activated SMADs (SMADs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8), which—after phosphorylation by activated type I receptors-association with SMAD4, the only member of the second group. This heterodimeric complex translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of target genes. The third group (SMAD6, SMAD7) is the inhibitory SMADs, which can bind to type I receptors and prevent the phosphorylation of the receptor-activated SMADs.

## RTKs produce phosphotyrosine motifs recognized by SH2 and phosphotyrosine-binding domains of downstream effectors

In addition to the class of receptors with intrinsic serine/ threonine kinase activity, other plasma-membrane receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. All RTKs discovered to date phosphorylate themselves in addition to other cellular proteins. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), plateletderived growth factor (PDGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), insulin and insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF) can all bind to receptors that possess intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity.

Creation of Phosphotyrosine Motifs Most RTKs are singlepass transmembrane proteins that have an extracellular ligand-binding domain and a single intracellular kinase domain (see Fig. 3-12C). Binding of a ligand, such as NGF, facilitates the formation of receptor dimers that in turn promote the direct association and trans-phosphorylation of the adjacent kinase domains; the result is activation of the receptor complex. The activated receptors then catalyze the addition of phosphate to tyrosine $(\mathrm{Y})$ residues on the receptor itself as well as specific membrane-associated and cytoplasmic proteins. The resulting phosphotyrosine ( $\mathbf{p Y}$ )

motifs serve as high-affinity binding sites for the recruitment of a number of intracellular signaling molecules, discussed in the next paragraph. These interactions lead to the formation of a signaling complex and the activation of downstream effectors. Some RTKs, such as the insulin and IGF-1 receptors, (○) N3-20 exist as dimers even before ligand binding but undergo a conformational change that promotes autophosphorylation and activation of the kinase domains (see pp. 1041-1042).

Recognition of pY Motifs by SH2 and PhosphotyrosineBinding Domains The pY motifs created by tyrosine kinases serve as high-affinity binding sites for the recruitment of cytoplasmic or membrane-associated proteins that contain either an SH2 domain or PTB (phosphotyrosine-binding) domain. SH2 domains are $\sim 100$ amino acids in length. They are composed of relatively well conserved residues that form the binding pocket for pY motifs as well as more variable residues that are implicated in binding specificity. These residues that confer binding specificity primarily recognize the three amino acids located on the C-terminal side of the phosphotyrosine. For example, the activated PDGF receptor has five such pY motifs (Table 3-5), each of which interacts with a specific SH2-containing protein.

In contrast to SH2 and PTB domains, which interact with highly regulated pY motifs, Src homology 3 (SH3) domains interact constitutively with proline-rich regions in other proteins in a manner that does not require phosphorylation of the motif. However, phosphorylation at distant sites can change the conformation near the proline-rich region and thereby regulate the interaction. Like SH2 interactions, SH3 interactions appear to be responsible for targeting of signaling molecules to specific subcellular locations. SH2- or SH3-containing proteins include growth factor receptorbound protein 2 (GRB2), PLC $\gamma$, and the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.

The MAPK Pathway A common pathway by which activated RTKs transduce their signal to cytosol and even to the nucleus is a cascade of events that increase the activity of the small GTP-binding protein Ras. This Ras-dependent signaling pathway involves the following steps (Fig. 3-13):

Step 1: A ligand binds to the extracellular domain of a specific RTK, thus causing receptor dimerization.

## N3-19 SMADs

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The largest group of SMAD proteins is the receptor-activated SMADs (SMADs 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8), which have a type I receptor-interacting domain that is phosphorylated by the activated type I receptor; this phosphorylation results in their disassociation from the receptor and subsequent association with the regulatory SMAD, SMAD4. This heterodimeric complex translocates to the nucleus where it can regulate transcription of target genes by both direct and indirect mechanisms.

The signaling specificity of this system comes from two mechanisms. First, distinct members of the receptor-activated SMAD group interact with specific type I receptors. For example SMAD2 and SMAD3 associate with the TGF- $\beta$ type I receptor ALK-5, whereas SMAD1 associates with bone morphogenic protein (BMP) type I receptors such as ALK-2 and ALK-3. Second, the receptor-activated SMAD/SMAD4 heterodimer regulates not only downstream effector gene expression but also the expression of a third group of SMADs, the inhibitory SMADs. These proteins (SMAD6, SMAD7), once expressed, can bind to type I receptors and prevent the association and activation of receptor-activated SMADs.

## N3-20 Insulin and IGF-1 Receptors

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The insulin receptor (see Fig. 51-5) and the IGF-1 receptor are activated by somewhat different mechanisms, as we discuss on pages 1041-1042 for the insulin receptor and on page 996 for the IGF-1 receptor. In brief, these receptors are tetrameric; they are composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits. The $\alpha$ subunit contains a cysteine-rich region and functions in ligand binding. The $\beta$ subunit is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits are held together by disulfide bonds (as are the two $\alpha$ subunits), forming a heterotetramer. Ligand binding produces conformational changes that appear to cause allosteric interactions between the two $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pairs, as opposed to the dimerization characteristic of the first class of RTKs (see Fig. 3-12C). Thus, insulin binding results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the catalytic domains of the $\beta$ subunits. The activated insulin receptor also phosphorylates cytoplasmic substrates such as IRS-1 (insulin-receptor substrate 1; see Fig. 51-6), which, once phosphorylated, serves as a docking site for additional signaling proteins.

Figure 3-13 Regulation of transcription by the Ras pathway. A ligand, such as a growth factor, binds to a specific RTK, and this leads to an increase in gene transcription in a 10-step process.

Step 2: The now-activated RTK phosphorylates itself on tyrosine residues of the cytoplasmic domain (autophosphorylation).
Step 3: GRB2, an SH2-containing protein, recognizes pY residues on the activated receptor.
Step 4: Because GRB2 constitutively associates with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor SOS (son of sevenless), via an SH3-proline interaction, the recruitment of GRB2 automatically results in the recruitment of SOS as well.
Step 5: SOS activates the small G protein Ras by catalyzing the replacement of GDP with GTP.
Step 6: The activated GTP-Ras complex activates other proteins by physically recruiting them to the plasma membrane. In particular, active GTP-Ras interacts with the N-terminal portion of the cytosolic serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 (also known as MAP kinase kinase kinase or MAPKKK or MAP3K), which is the first in a series of sequentially activated protein kinases that ultimately transmits the activation signal.
Step 7: Raf-1 phosphorylates and activates a protein kinase called MEK (also known as MAP kinase kinase or MAPKK). MEK is a multifunctional protein kinase that phosphorylates substrates on both tyrosine and serine/ threonine residues.
Step 8: MEK phosphorylates MAPKs, cytosolic serine/ threonine kinases also called extracellular signalregulated kinases (ERK1, ERK2). Activation of MAPK requires dual phosphorylation on neighboring serine and tyrosine residues. Raf, MEK, and MAPK typically assemble on a scaffolding protein at the inner side of the
cell membrane to facilitate interaction/phosphorylation during the activation process.
Step 9: MAPK is an important effector molecule in Rasdependent signaling to the cytoskeleton. MAPK phosphorylates multiple proteins involved in actin cytoskeletal assembly and cell-matrix interactions; this phosphorylation leads to Ras-dependent changes in cell morphology and cell migration.
Step 10: Once activated, MAPK disassociates from the scaffold and translocates primarily to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates a number of nuclear proteins that are transcription factors. The result is either enhancement or repression of the DNA binding and transcriptional activity of these nuclear proteins. (5) N3-21

Two other signal-transduction pathways (cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) can modulate the activity of some of the protein intermediates in this MAPK cascade, which suggests multiple points of integration for the various signaling systems.

The Phosphatidylinositol-3-Kinase Pathway The phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) is an SH2 domain-containing protein that commonly signals downstream of RTKs. PI3K is a heterodimer consisting of a p85 regulatory subunit and p110 catalytic subunit. p85 has an SH2 domain for targeting the complex to activated receptors and an SH3 domain that mediates constitutive association with p110. p110 is a lipid kinase that phosphorylates $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ (see p. 58) on the 3 position of the inositol ring to form $\mathbf{P I P}_{3}, \mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ is a relatively common lipid in the inner leaflet of the cell membrane, whereas $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$ constitutes $<1 \%$ of membrane lipids in a quiescent cell.

Following RTK activation, the newly recruited PI3K produces PIP ${ }_{3}$ locally in the membrane, where it serves as a binding site for proteins such as 3-phosphoinositidedependent kinase 1 (PDK1), PKC (see pp. 60-61), and the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Vav. (5) N3-22 The events downstream of the insulin receptor are a good example of PDK1 signaling (see Fig. 51-6). As PDK1 binds to PIP ${ }_{3}$, its kinase activity leads to phosphorylation and activation of the downstream target Akt (also known as protein kinase B or PKB). Akt is itself a serine/threonine kinase that regulates multiple downstream targets, inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase $3-\beta$ (GSK-3 $\beta$ ), activating the mTOR pathway via phosphorylation and inhibition of tuberin (5) N3-23 and inhibiting the proapoptotic proteins BAD and caspase-9 (see Fig. 62-6).

## Tyrosine kinase-associated receptors activate cytosolic tyrosine kinases such as Src and JAK

Some of the receptors for cytokines and growth factors that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation do not themselves have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but can associate with nonreceptor tyrosine kinases (see Fig. 3-12D). Receptors in this class include those for several cytokines, including IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GMCSF), and erythropoietin (EPO). The family also includes receptors for growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), leptin, ciliary neurotrophin factor (CNTF), oncostatin M, and IFN$\alpha$, IFN- $\beta$, and IFN- $\gamma$.

The tyrosine kinase-associated receptors typically comprise multiple subunits that form homodimers ( $\alpha \alpha$ ), heterodimers ( $\alpha \beta$ ), or heterotrimers ( $\alpha \beta \gamma$ ). For example, the IL-3 and the GM-CSF receptors are heterodimers ( $\alpha \beta$ ) that share common $\beta$ subunits with transducing activity. (5) N3-24 However, none of the cytoplasmic portions of the receptor subunits contains kinase domains or other sequences with recognized catalytic function. Instead, tyrosine kinases of the Src family and Janus family (JAK or Janus kinases) associate noncovalently with the cytoplasmic domains of these receptors. Thus, these are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases. Ligand binding to these receptors results in receptor dimerization and activation of the associated tyrosine kinase. The activated kinase then phosphorylates tyrosines on both itself and the receptor. Thus, tyrosine kinase-associated receptors, together with their tyrosine kinases, function much like the RTKs discussed in the previous section. A key difference is that for the tyrosine kinaseassociated receptors, the receptors and kinases are encoded by separate genes and the proteins are only loosely associated with one another.

The Src family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases includes at least nine members. Alternative initiation codons and tissue-specific splicing result in at least 14 related gene products.

The conserved regions of Src-related proteins can be divided into five domains: (1) an N-terminal myristylation site, through which the kinase is tethered to the membrane; (2) an SH3 domain, which binds to proline-rich regions of the kinase itself or to other cytosolic proteins; (3) an SH2 domain, which binds phosphorylated tyrosines; (4) the

## BOX 3-5 Oncogenes

The ability of certain viral proteins (oncogenes) to transform a cell from a normal to a malignant phenotype was initially thought to occur because these viral proteins acted as transcriptional activators or repressors. However, during the last 20 years, only a few of these viral proteins have been found to work in this manner. The majority of oncogenes harbor mutations that transform them into constitutively active forms of normal cellular signaling proteins called protooncogenes. Most of these aberrant proteins (i.e., the oncogenes) encode proteins important in a key signal-transduction pathway. For example, expression of the viral protein v-erb B is involved in fibrosarcomas, and both v-erb A and v-erb B are associated with leukemias. v-erb B resembles a constitutively activated RTK (EGF receptor), and the retroviral v-erb A is derived from a cellular gene encoding a thyroid hormone receptor. Other receptors and signaling molecules implicated in cell transformation include Src, Ras, and PDGF receptor. A mutation in protein tyrosine phosphatase 1C results in abnormal hematopoiesis and an increased incidence of lymphoreticular tumors.
catalytic domain, which has tyrosine kinase activity; and (5) a noncatalytic C terminus. Members of this family are kept in the inactive state by tyrosine phosphorylation at a conserved residue in the C terminus that causes the pY to bind to the N-terminal SH2 domain of the same molecule. The result is a masking of the intervening kinase domain. Dephosphorylation of the pY residue after the activation of such phosphatases as receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase $\alpha(R P T P \alpha)$ or the cytosolic SHP2 releases this inhibition, and the kinase domain can then phosphorylate its intracellular substrates.

Many of the Src family members were first identified in transformed cells or tumors because of mutations that caused them to be constitutively active. When these mutations result in malignant transformation of the cell, the gene in question is designated an oncogene; the normal, unaltered physiological counterpart of an oncogene is called a proto-oncogene.

The Janus family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases in mammals includes JAK1, JAK2, and Tyk2. JAK originally stood for "just another kinase." Major downstream targets of the JAKs include one or more members of the STAT (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family. When phosphorylated, STATs interact with other STAT family members to form a complex that translocates to the nucleus (see p. 90). There, the complex facilitates the transcription of specific genes that are specialized for a rapid response, such as those that are characterized by the acute-phase response of inflammation (see p. 1202). For example, IL-6 binding to the heterodimeric IL6R/GP130 receptor on hepatocytes activates JAK/STAT, which enhances transcription of the acutephase proteins. During inflammation, these acute-phase proteins function to limit tissue damage by inhibiting the proteases that attack healthy cells as well as diseased ones. The pattern of STAT activation provides a mechanism for cytokine individuality. For example, EPO activates STAT5a and STAT5b as part of the early events in erythropoiesis, whereas IL-4 or IL-12 activates STAT4 and STAT6.

## N3-24 Multimeric Composition of Tyrosine Kinase-Associated Receptors

## Contributed by Laurie Roman

In the text, we pointed out that the IL-3 and GM-CSF receptors are heterodimers ( $\alpha \beta$ ) that share a common $\beta$ subunit that has transducing activity. A similar example is the group of three receptors for IL-6, oncostatin M (OncM), and IL-11. These three receptors use a common transducer subunit called gp130 as well as a unique subunit for ligand binding.

## N3-23 Tuberous Sclerosis

Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski
Tuberous sclerosis is a result of the mutation of the gene TSC1 or TSC2.

Attenuation of the cytokine JAK-STAT signaling cascade involves the production of inhibitors that suppress tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of the STATs. For example, IL-6 and LIF both induce expression of the inhibitor SST-1, which contains an SH2 domain and prevents JAK2 or Tyk2 from activating STAT3 in M1 myeloid leukemia cells.

## Receptor tyrosine phosphatases are required for lymphocyte activation

Tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated by the tyrosine kinases described in the preceding two sections are dephosphorylated by PTPs, which can be either cytosolic or membrane spanning (i.e., the receptor tyrosine phosphatases). We discussed the cytosolic PTPs above. Both classes of tyrosine phosphatases have structures very different from the ones that dephosphorylate serine and threonine residues. Because the tyrosine phosphatases are highly active, pY groups tend to have a short half-life and are relatively few in number in unstimulated cells.

The CD45 protein, found at the cell surface of T and B lymphocytes, is an example of a receptor tyrosine phosphatase. CD45 makes a single pass through the membrane. Its glycosylated extracellular domain functions as a receptor for antibodies, whereas its cytoplasmic domain has tyrosine phosphatase activity (see Fig. 3-12E). During their maturation, lymphocytes express several variants of CD45 characterized by different patterns of alternative splicing and glycosylation. CD45 plays a critical role in signal transduction in lymphocytes. For instance, CD45 dephosphorylates and thereby activates Lck and Fyn (two receptor-associated tyrosine kinases of the Src family) and triggers the phosphorylation of other proteins downstream in the signaltransduction cascade. This interaction between receptor tyrosine phosphatases and tyrosine kinase-associated receptors is another example of crosstalk between signaling pathways.

## NUCLEAR RECEPTORS

## Steroid and thyroid hormones enter the cell and bind to members of the nuclear receptor superfamily in the cytoplasm or nucleus

A number of important signaling molecules produce their effects not by binding to receptors on the cell membrane but by binding to nuclear receptors (NRs)—also called intracellular receptors-that can act as transcription regulators, a concept that we will discuss in more depth beginning on p . 81. This family includes receptors for steroid hormones, prostaglandins, vitamin D, thyroid hormones, and retinoic acid (Table 3-6). In addition, this family includes related receptors, known as orphan receptors, whose ligands have yet to be identified. Steroid hormones, vitamin D, and retinoic acid appear to enter the cell by diffusing through the lipid phase of the cell membrane. Thyroid hormones, which are charged amino-acid derivatives, may cross the cell membrane either by diffusion or by carrier-mediated transport. Once inside the cell, these substances bind to intracellular receptors. The ligand-bound receptors are activated transcription factors that regulate the expression of target genes by binding to

specific DNA sequences. In addition, steroid hormones can have nongenomic effects (see p. 989). ( $\bigcirc$ N3-25

The family of nuclear receptors contains at least 48 genes and has been classically divided into two subfamilies based on structural homology. One subfamily consists of receptors for steroid hormones, including the glucocorticoids (see pp. 1018-1026), mineralocorticoids (see pp. 1026-1030), and androgens (see pp. 1097-1100), as well as estrogens and progesterone (see pp. 1116-1120). These receptors function primarily as homodimers (see Table 3-6). The other group includes receptors for retinoic acid, thyroid hormone (see pp. 1006-1010), and vitamin D (see pp. 1063-1067). These receptors appear to act as heterodimers (see Table 3-6). As we will see on page 956, other nuclear receptors recognize a wide range of xenobiotics and metabolites, and thereby modulate the expression of genes that encode transporters and enzymes involved in drug metabolism.

The intracellular localization of the different unoccupied receptors varies. The glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors are mainly cytoplasmic, the estrogen (ER) and progesterone (PR) receptors are primarily nuclear, and the thyroid hormone (TR) and retinoic acid (RAR) receptors are bound to DNA in the nucleus. Cytoplasmic receptors are frequently complexed to chaperone (or "heat shock") proteins. Hormone binding induces a conformational change in these receptors that causes dissociation from the cytoplasmic chaperone and unmasks a nuclear transport signal that allows the hormone-receptor complex to translocate into the nucleus.

Nuclear receptors contain five to six functionally distinct domains (Fig. 3-14) that are differentially conserved among the various members of the family. The N-terminal A/B region differs most widely among receptors and contains the

# N3-25 Nongenomic Effects of Steroid Hormones 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

A theme that is developing in the literature is that certain steroid hormones, when applied to cells in culture, produce biological effects that are too rapid to be mediated by altered gene expression. An example is aldosterone, which-in several cell lines-can cause $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, to decrease so rapidly that the effect simply could not be due to altered protein synthesis. Moreover, treatments that block protein synthesis fail to inhibit the ability of aldosterone to lower $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. It is not clear how such rapid, nongenomic effects of steroid hormones may occur. One possibility is that the aldosterone interacts with an alternate receptor (i.e., not the mineralocorticoid receptor that it would normally bind to in the cytoplasm). Another possibility is that aldosterone might bind to the mineralocorticoid receptor, which could have a rapid effect in addition to the traditional, slower genomic effect. Finally, it is possible that the aldosterone nonspecifically interacts with elements of another signaling cascade. Regardless of the mechanism, the rapid action of aldosterone is an exception to the general rule that all of the actions of steroid-type hormones occur by modulation of transcription.

Figure 3-14 Modular construction of intracellular (or nuclear) receptors. Members of this family exist in the cytoplasm or nucleus and include receptors for several ligands, including retinoic acid, vitamin D, thyroid hormones, and steroid hormones. These receptors have modular construction, with up to six elements. The percentages listed inside the $A / B, C$, and $E$ domains refer to the degrees of amino-acid identity, referenced to the glucocorticoid receptor. Thus, the DNA-binding or C domain of the retinoic acid receptor is $45 \%$ identical to the corresponding domain on the glucocorticoid receptor.
first of two transactivation domains. Transactivation is the process by which a ligand-induced conformational change of the receptor results in a change in conformation of the DNA and thus initiates transcription. The C region, the most highly conserved among receptor types, contains the DNAbinding domain and is also involved in dimerization (see Table 3-6). It is composed of two "zinc finger" structures (see p. 82). The D, or hinge, region contains the "nuclear localization signal" and may also contain transactivation sequences. The E domain is responsible for hormone binding. Like the C region, it is involved in dimerization via its "basic zipper" region (see p. 83). Finally, like the A/B region, the E region contains a transactivation domain. The small C-terminal F domain is present in only some nuclear receptors and is of unknown function.

## Activated nuclear receptors bind to sequence elements in the regulatory region of responsive genes and either activate or repress DNA transcription

One of the remarkable features of nuclear receptors is that they bind very specifically to short DNA sequences-called hormone response elements-in the regulatory region of responsive genes. The various nuclear receptors display specific cell and tissue distributions. Thus, the battery of genes affected by a particular ligand depends on the complement of receptors in the cell, the ability of these receptors to form homodimers or heterodimers, and the affinity of these receptor-ligand complexes for a particular response element on the DNA.

In addition to affecting transcription by directly binding to specific regulatory elements, several nuclear receptors modulate gene expression by acting as transcriptional repressors (see p. 92). For example, the glucocorticoids, acting via their receptor, can attenuate components of the inflammatory response by suppressing the transcriptional activity of other transcription factors such as activator protein 1 (AP-1; see Table 4-1) and nuclear factor $\kappa B$ (NF- $\kappa B$; see pp. 86-87).

# REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION 

Peter Igarashi

In this chapter, we discuss general principles of gene structure and expression as well as mechanisms underlying the regulation of tissue-specific and inducible gene expression. We will see that proteins (transcription factors) control gene transcription by interacting with regulatory elements in DNA (e.g., promoters and enhancers). Because many transcription factors are effector molecules in signal-transduction pathways, these transcription factors can coordinately regulate gene expression in response to physiological stimuli. Finally, we describe the important roles of epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Because many of the proteins and DNA sequences are known by abbreviations, the Glossary at the end of the chapter identifies these entities.

## FROM GENES TO PROTEINS

## Gene expression differs among tissues and-in any tissue-may vary in response to external stimuli

The haploid human genome contains 20,000 to 30,000 distinct genes, but only about one third of these genes are actively translated into proteins in any individual cell. Cells from different tissues have distinct morphological appearances and functions and respond differently to external stimuli, even though their DNA content is identical. For example, although all cells of the body contain an albumin gene, only liver cells (hepatocytes) can synthesize and secrete albumin into the bloodstream. Conversely, hepatocytes cannot synthesize insulin, which pancreatic $\beta$ cells produce. The explanation for these observations is that expression of genes is regulated so that some genes are active in hepatocytes and others are silent. In pancreatic $\beta$ cells, a different set of genes is active; others, such as those expressed only in the liver, are silent. How does the organism program one cell type to express liver-specific genes, and another to express a set of genes appropriate for the pancreas? This phenomenon is called tissue-specific gene expression.

A second issue is that genes in individual cells are generally not expressed at constant, unchanging levels (constitutive expression). Rather, their expression levels often vary widely in response to environmental stimuli. For example, when blood glucose levels decrease, $\alpha$ cells in the pancreas secrete the hormone glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053). Glucagon circulates in the blood until it reaches the liver, where it causes a 15 -fold increase in expression of the gene that encodes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), an enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis (see pp. 1051). Increased gluconeogenesis then contributes to restoration of blood glucose levels toward normal. This simple regulatory loop, which necessitates that the liver cells perceive the presence of glucagon and stimulate PEPCK gene expression, illustrates the phenomenon of inducible gene expression.

## Genetic information flows from DNA to proteins

The "central dogma of molecular biology" states that genetic information flows unidirectionally from DNA to proteins. DNA is a polymer of nucleotides, each containing a nitrogenous base (adenine, A; guanine, G; cytosine, C; or thymine, T) attached to deoxyribose $5^{\prime}$-phosphate. The polymerized nucleotides form a polynucleotide strand in which the sequence of the nitrogenous bases constitutes the genetic information. With few exceptions, all cells in the body share the same genetic information. Hydrogen-bond formation between bases ( A and T , or G and C ) on the two complementary strands of DNA produces a double-helical structure.

DNA has two functions. The first is to serve as a selfrenewing data repository that maintains a constant source of genetic information for the cell. This role is achieved by DNA replication, which ensures that when cells divide, the progeny cells receive exact copies of the DNA. The second purpose of DNA is to serve as a template for the translation of genetic information into proteins, which are the functional units of the cell. This second purpose is broadly defined as gene expression.

Gene expression involves two major processes (Fig. 4-1). The first process-transcription-is the synthesis of RNA from a DNA template, mediated by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II. The resultant RNA molecule is identical in sequence to one of the strands of the DNA template except that the base uracil (U) replaces thymine (T). The second process-translation-is the synthesis of protein from RNA. During translation, the genetic code in the sequence of RNA is "read" by transfer RNA (tRNA), and then amino acids carried by the tRNA are covalently linked together to form a polypeptide chain. In eukaryotic cells, transcription occurs in the nucleus, whereas translation occurs on ribosomes

![bo524543376c](bo524543376c.jpg)

located in the cytoplasm. Therefore, an intermediary RNA, called messenger RNA (mRNA), is required to transport the genetic information from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The complete process, proceeding from DNA in the nucleus to protein in the cytoplasm, constitutes gene expression.

Although the central dogma of molecular biology applies to most protein-coding genes, exceptions exist. For example, RNA viruses (such as the human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome) contain their genetic information in the sequence of an RNA genome. Upon infection with HIV, the cell "reverse transcribes" the RNA genome into double-stranded DNA that then integrates into the host DNA genome. Transcription of the virally encoded DNA by the host transcriptional machinery produces RNA molecules that become part of new HIV particles. Cells transcribe some genes into RNAs that do not encode proteins. So-called noncoding RNAs include ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and transfer RNA (tRNA) that participate in protein translation, small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) that are involved in RNA splicing, and microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate mRNA abundance and translation (see pp. 99-100).

## The gene consists of a transcription unit

Figure 4-2 depicts the structure of a typical eukaryotic protein-coding gene. The gene consists of a segment of DNA that is transcribed into RNA. It extends from the site of transcription initiation to the site of transcription termination. The region of DNA that is immediately adjacent to and upstream (i.e., in the $5^{\prime}$ direction) from the transcription initiation site is called the $5^{\prime}$ flanking region. The corresponding domain that is downstream ( $3^{\prime}$ ) to the transcription termination site is called the $3^{\prime}$ flanking region. (Recall that DNA strands have directionality because of the $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ orientation of the phosphodiester bonds in the sugarphosphate backbone of DNA. By convention, the DNA strand that has the same sequence as the RNA is called the coding strand, and the complementary strand is called the noncoding strand. The $5^{\prime}$ to $3^{\prime}$ orientation refers to the coding strand.) Although the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ flanking regions are not transcribed into RNA, they frequently contain DNA sequences, called regulatory elements, that control gene transcription. The site where transcription of the gene begins, sometimes called the cap site, may have a variant of the nucleotide sequence $5^{\prime}$-ACTT(T/C)TG-3' (called the cap sequence), where T/C means T or C . The A is the transcription initiation site. Transcription proceeds to the transcription termination site, which has a less defined sequence and location in eukaryotic genes. Slightly upstream from the termination site is another sequence called the polyadenylation signal, which often has the sequence $5^{\prime}$-AATAAA-3'.

The RNA that is initially transcribed from a gene is called the primary transcript (see Fig. 4-2) or precursor mRNA (pre-mRNA). Before it can be translated into protein, the primary transcript must be processed into a mature mRNA in the nucleus. Most eukaryotic genes contain exons, DNA sequences that are present in the mature mRNA, alternating with introns, which are not present in the mRNA. The primary transcript is colinear with the coding strand of the gene and contains the sequences of both the exons and the introns. To produce a mature mRNA that can be translated into protein, the cell must process the primary transcript in four steps.

First, the cell adds an unusual guanosine base, which is methylated at the 7 position, via a $5^{\prime}-5^{\prime}$ phosphodiester bond to the $5^{\prime}$ end of the transcript. The result is a $5^{\prime}$ methyl cap. The presence of the $5^{\prime}$ methyl cap is required for export of the mRNA from the nucleus to the cytoplasm as well as for translation of the mRNA.

Second, the cell removes the sequences of the introns from the primary transcript via a process called pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing involves the joining of the sequences of the exons in the RNA transcript and the removal of the

intervening introns. As a result, mature mRNA (see Fig. 4-2) is shorter and not colinear with the coding strand of the DNA template.

The third processing step is cleavage of the RNA transcript about 20 nucleotides downstream from the polyadenylation signal, near the $3^{\prime}$ end of the transcript.

The fourth step is the addition of a string of 100 to 200 adenine bases at the site of the cleavage to form a poly(A) tail. This tail contributes to mRNA stability.

The mature mRNA produced by RNA processing not only contains a coding region-the open-reading frame-that encodes protein but also sequences at the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ ends that are not translated into protein-the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ untranslated regions (UTRs), respectively. Translation of the mRNA on ribosomes always begins at the codon AUG, which encodes methionine, and proceeds until the ribosome encounters one
of the three stop codons (UAG, UAA, or UGA). Thus, the $5^{\prime}$ end of the mRNA is the first to be translated and provides the N terminus of the protein; the $3^{\prime}$ end is the last to be translated and contributes the C terminus.

## DNA is packaged into chromatin

Although DNA is commonly depicted as linear, chromosomal DNA in the nucleus is actually organized into a higher-order structure called chromatin. This packaging is required to fit DNA with a total length of $\sim 1 \mathrm{~m}$ into a nucleus with a diameter of $10^{-5} \mathrm{~m}$. Chromatin consists of DNA associated with histones and other nuclear proteins. The basic building block of chromatin is the nucleosome (Fig. 4-3), each of which consists of a protein core and 147 base pairs (bp) of associated DNA. The protein core is an octamer of

![bo544543376c](bo544543376c.jpg)

Figure 4-3 Chromatin structure.
the histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4. DNA wraps twice around the core histones to form a solenoid-like structure. A linker histone, H1, associates with segments of DNA between nucleosomes. Regular arrays of nucleosomes have a beads-on-a-string appearance and constitute the so-called $11-\mathrm{nm}$ fiber of chromatin, which can condense to form the $30-\mathrm{nm}$ fiber.

Chromatin exists in two general forms that can be distinguished cytologically by their different degrees of condensation. Heterochromatin is a highly condensed form of chromatin that is transcriptionally inactive. In general, highly organized chromatin structure is associated with repression of gene transcription. Heterochromatin contains mostly repetitive DNA sequences and relatively few genes. Euchromatin has a more open structure and contains genes that are actively transcribed. Even in the transcriptionally active "open" euchromatin, local chromatin structure may influence the activity of individual genes.

## Gene expression may be regulated at multiple steps

Gene expression involves eight steps (Fig. 4-4):
Step 1: Chromatin remodeling. Before a gene can be transcribed, some local alteration in chromatin structure
must occur so that the enzymes that mediate transcription can gain access to the genomic DNA. The alteration in chromatin structure is called chromatin remodeling, which may involve loosening of the interaction between histones and DNA, repositioning of nucleosomes, or local depletion of histones.
Step 2: Initiation of transcription. In this step, RNA polymerase is recruited to the gene promoter and begins to synthesize RNA that is complementary in sequence to one of the strands of the template DNA. For most eukaryotic genes, initiation of transcription is the critical, ratelimiting step in gene expression.
Step 3: Transcript elongation. During transcript elongation, RNA polymerase proceeds down the DNA strand and sequentially adds ribonucleotides to the elongating strand of RNA. (1) N4-1
Step 4: Termination of transcription. After producing a full-length RNA, the enzyme halts elongation.
Step 5: RNA processing. As noted before, RNA processing involves (a) addition of a $5^{\prime}$ methylguanosine cap, (b) pre-mRNA splicing, (c) cleavage of the RNA strand, and (d) polyadenylation.
Step 6: Nucleocytoplasmic transport. The next step in gene expression is the export of the mature mRNA through pores in the nuclear envelope (see p. 21) into the

# N4-1 Role of Tat in Transcript Elongation 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

Regulation of elongation appears to be critical for the expression of certain genes, such as some genes of HIV-1, the causative agent of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-1 is a retrovirus (RNA virus) that preferentially infects cells of the immune system. After infection, the RNA viral genome is "reverse" transcribed into double-stranded DNA, which integrates into the host genome. A viral promoter that is located in the long terminal repeat of the viral genome then drives expression of the viral genes. Immediately downstream from the promoter-and within the 5'untranslated region-is a regulatory element known as the transactivation response element (TAR). Unlike the regulatory elements that we have discussed above, this element is active in transcribed RNA. The sequence of TAR contains an inverted repeat,

## A ABSENCE OF Tat

![bo554543376c](bo554543376c.jpg)
and a stretch of nucleotides on one part of the TAR pairs with nucleotides on the other part to create a hairpin structure in this viral transcript (eFig. 4-1). Because the inverted repeat is imperfect, the hairpin contains a "bulge." Elongation of transcription cannot occur unless a virally encoded protein called Tat binds to this bulge in the TAR portion of the RNA transcript. In the absence of Tat, transcription initiates but elongation does not proceed past the TAR; the resulting truncated transcripts do not encode proteins. In the presence of Tat, Pol II can read through the TAR and elongation proceeds normally, producing full-length RNA. It appears that the function of TAR is to recruit Tat to the promoter. Tat, in turn, associates with P-TEFb, a kinase that phosphorylates the CTD of Pol II (see p. 85 and Fig. 4-10) and stimulates transcription elongation.

cytoplasm. Nucleocytoplasmic transport is a regulated process that is important for mRNA quality control.
Step 7: Translation. The mRNA is translated into proteins on ribosomes. During translation, the genetic code on the mRNA is read by tRNA, and then amino acids carried by the tRNA are added to the nascent polypeptide chain.
Step 8: mRNA degradation. Finally, the mRNA is degraded in the cytoplasm by a combination of endonucleases and exonucleases.

Each of these steps is potentially a target for regulation (see Fig. 4-4, right panel):

1. Gene expression may be regulated by global as well as by local alterations in chromatin structure.
2. An important related alteration in chromatin structure is the state of methylation of the DNA.
3. Initiation of transcription can be regulated by transcriptional activators and transcriptional repressors.
4. Transcript elongation may be regulated by premature termination in which the polymerase falls off (or is displaced from) the template DNA strand; such termination results in the synthesis of truncated transcripts.
5. Pre-mRNA splicing may be regulated by alternative splicing, which generates different mRNA species from the same primary transcript.
6. At the step of nucleocytoplasmic transport, the cell prevents expression of aberrant transcripts, such as those with defects in mRNA processing. In addition, mutant

transcripts containing premature stop codons may be degraded in the nucleus through a process called nonsense-mediated decay.
7. Control of translation of mRNA is a regulated step in the expression of certain genes, such as the transferrin receptor gene.
8. Control of mRNA stability contributes to steady-state levels of mRNA in the cytoplasm and is important for the overall expression of many genes.

Although any of these steps may be critical for regulating a particular gene, transcription initiation is the most frequently regulated (step 2) and is the focus of this chapter. At the end of the chapter, we describe examples of epigenetic regulation of gene expression and regulation at steps that are subsequent to the initiation of transcription-posttranscriptional regulation.

## Transcription factors are proteins that regulate gene transcription

A general principle is that gene transcription is regulated by interactions of specific proteins with specific DNA sequences. The proteins that regulate gene transcription are called transcription factors. Many transcription factors recognize and bind to specific sequences in DNA. The binding sites for these transcription factors are called regulatory elements. Because they are located on the same piece of DNA as the genes that they regulate, these regulatory elements are sometimes referred to as cis-acting factors.

Figure 4-5 illustrates the overall scheme for the regulation of gene expression. Transcription requires proteins (transcription factors) that bind to specific DNA sequences (regulatory elements) located near the genes they regulate (target genes). Once the proteins bind to DNA, they stimulate (or inhibit) transcription of the target gene. A particular transcription factor can regulate the transcription of multiple target genes. In general, regulation of gene expression can occur at the level of either transcription factors or regulatory
![bo584543376c](bo584543376c.jpg)

Figure 4-5 Regulation of transcription. Protein A, a transcription factor that is encoded by gene A (not shown), regulates another gene, gene B. Protein A binds to a DNA sequence (a regulatory element) that is upstream from gene B; this DNA sequence is a cis-acting element because it is located on the same DNA as gene B. In this example, protein A stimulates (transactivates) the transcription of gene B. Transcription factors also can inhibit transcription.
elements. Examples of regulation at the level of transcription factors include variations in the abundance of transcription factors, their DNA-binding activities, and their ability to stimulate (or to inhibit) transcription. Examples of regulation at the level of regulatory elements include alterations in chromatin structure (which influences accessibility to transcription factors) and covalent modifications of DNA, especially methylation.

## THE PROMOTER AND REGULATORY ELEMENTS

## The basal transcriptional machinery mediates gene transcription

Protein-coding genes are transcribed by an enzyme called RNA polymerase II (Pol II), which catalyzes the synthesis of RNA that is complementary in sequence to a DNA template. Pol II is a large protein (molecular mass of 600 kDa ) comprising 10 to 12 subunits. Although Pol II catalyzes mRNA synthesis, by itself it is incapable of binding to DNA and initiating transcription at specific sites. The recruitment of Pol II and initiation of transcription requires an assembly of proteins called general transcription factors. Six general transcription factors are known-TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIID, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH-each of which contains multiple subunits. ( $\mathbf{N 4 - 2}$ These general transcription factors are essential for the transcription of all protein-coding genes, which distinguishes them from the transcription factors discussed below that are involved in the transcription of specific genes. Together with Pol II, the general transcription factors constitute the basal transcriptional machinery, which is also known as the RNA polymerase holoenzyme or preinitiation complex because its assembly is required before transcription can begin. The basal transcriptional machinery assembles at a region of DNA that is immediately upstream from the gene and includes the transcription initiation site. This region is called the gene promoter (Fig. 4-6).

## The promoter determines the initiation site and direction of transcription

The promoter is a cis-acting regulatory element that is required for expression of the gene. In addition to locating the site for initiation of transcription, the promoter also determines the direction of transcription. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, no unique sequence defines the gene promoter. Instead, the promoter consists of modules of simple sequences (DNA elements). (○) N4-3 A common DNA element in many promoters is the Goldberg-Hogness TATA box. The TATA box has the consensus sequence $5^{\prime}$-GNGTATA(A/T)A(A/T)-3', where N is any nucleotide. The TATA box is usually located $\sim 30 \mathrm{bp}$ upstream ( $5^{\prime}$ ) from the site of transcription initiation. The general transcription factor TFIID-a component of the basal transcriptional machinery-recognizes the TATA box, which is thus believed to determine the site of transcription initiation. TFIID itself is composed of TATA-binding protein (TBP) and at least 10 TBP-associated factors (TAFs). The TBP subunit is a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein that binds to the TATA box. TAFs are involved in the activation of gene transcription (more on this below).

# N4-2 Sequential Assembly of General Transcription Factors 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

In vitro, the general transcription factors and Pol II assemble in a stepwise, ordered fashion on DNA. The first protein that binds to DNA is TFIID, which induces a bend in the DNA and forms a platform for the assembly of the remaining factors. Once TFIID binds to DNA, the other components of the basal transcriptional machinery assemble spontaneously by protein-protein interactions. The next general transcription factor that binds is TFIIA, which stabilizes the interaction of TFIID with DNA. Assembly of TFIIA is followed by assembly of TFIIB, which interacts with TFIID and also binds DNA. TFIIB then recruits a preassembled complex of Pol II and TFIIF. Entry of the Pol II-TFIIF complex into
the basal transcriptional machinery is followed by binding of TFIIE and TFIIH. TFIIF and TFIIH may assist in the transition from basal transcriptional machinery to an elongation complex, which may involve unwinding of the DNA that is mediated by the helicase activity of TFIIH. Although this stepwise assembly of Pol II and general transcription factors occurs in vitro, the situation in vivo may be different. In vivo, Pol II has been observed in a multiprotein complex containing general transcription factors and other proteins. This preformed complex may be recruited to DNA to initiate transcription.

eFigure 4-3 In this example, specific transcription factors bind to enhancer elements on the DNA and interact with the basal transcriptional machinery to increase the efficiency of gene transcription.

![bo614543376c](bo614543376c.jpg)

Some promoters do not contain a TATA box. Instead, these promoters contain other elements-for example, the initiator (Inr)-that bind general transcription factors. In addition to the TATA box and Inr, gene promoters contain other DNA elements that are necessary for initiating transcription. These elements consist of short DNA sequences and are sometimes called promoter-proximal sequences because they are located within $\sim 100 \mathrm{bp}$ upstream from the transcription initiation site. Promoter-proximal sequences are a type of regulatory element that is required for the transcription of specific genes. Well-characterized examples include the GC box (5'-GGGCGG-3') and the CCAAT box (5'-CCAAT-3'), (5) N4-4 as well as the CACCC box and octamer motif (5'-ATGCAAAT-3'). These DNA elements function as binding sites for additional proteins (transcription factors) that are necessary for initiating transcription of particular genes. The proteins that bind to these sites help recruit the basal transcriptional machinery to the promoter. Examples include the transcription factor NF-Y, which recognizes the CCAAT box, and Sp1 (stimulating protein 1), which recognizes the GC box. The CCAAT box is often located $\sim 50 \mathrm{bp}$ upstream from the TATA box, whereas multiple GC boxes are frequently found in TATA-less gene promoters. Some promoter-proximal sequences are present in genes that are active only in certain cell types. For example, the CACCC box found in gene promoters of $\beta$-globin (see pp. 80-81) is recognized by the erythroid-specific transcription factor EKLF (erythroid Kruppel-like factor).

## Positive and negative regulatory elements modulate gene transcription

Although the promoter is the site where the basal transcriptional machinery binds and initiates transcription, the promoter alone is not generally sufficient to initiate transcription at a physiologically significant rate. High-level gene expression generally requires activation of the basal transcriptional machinery by specific transcription factors, which bind to additional regulatory elements located near the target gene. Two general types of regulatory elements are recognized. First, positive regulatory elements or enhancers represent

DNA-binding sites for proteins that activate transcription; the proteins that bind to these DNA elements are called activators. Second, negative regulatory elements (NREs) or silencers are DNA binding sites for proteins that inhibit transcription; the proteins that bind to these DNA elements are called repressors (see Fig. 4-6).

A general property of enhancers and silencers is that they consist of modules of relatively short sequences of DNA, generally 6 to 12 bp . Regulatory elements are generally located in the vicinity of the genes that they regulate. Typically, regulatory elements reside in the $5^{\prime}$ flanking region that is upstream from the promoter. However, enhancers and silencers may be located downstream from the transcription initiation site or a considerable distance from the gene promoter, many hundreds or thousands of base pairs away. Moreover, the distance between the enhancer or silencer and the promoter can often be varied experimentally without substantially affecting transcriptional activity. In addition, many regulatory elements work equally well if their orientation is inverted. Thus, in contrast to the gene promoter, enhancers and silencers exhibit position independence and orientation independence. Another property of regulatory elements is that they are active on heterologous promoters; that is, if enhancers and silencers from one gene are placed near a promoter for a different gene, they can stimulate or inhibit transcription of the second gene.

After transcription factors (activators or repressors) bind to regulatory elements (enhancers or silencers), they may interact with the basal transcriptional machinery to alter gene transcription. How do transcription factors that bind to regulatory elements physically distant from the promoter interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery? Regulatory elements may be located hundreds of base pairs from the promoter. This distance is much too great to permit proteins that are bound at the regulatory element and promoter to come into contact along a twodimensional linear strand of DNA. Rather, DNA looping explains these long-range effects, whereby the transcription factor binds to the regulatory element, and the basal transcriptional machinery assembles on the gene promoter. Looping out of the intervening DNA permits physical

interaction between the transcription factor and the basal transcriptional machinery, which subsequently leads to alterations in gene transcription.

## Locus control regions and insulator elements influence transcription within multigene chromosomal domains

In addition to enhancers and silencers, which regulate the expression of individual genes, some cis-acting regulatory elements are involved in the regulation of chromosomal domains containing multiple genes.

The first of this type of element to be discovered was the locus control region (LCR), also called the locus-activating region or dominant control region. The LCR is a dominant, positive-acting cis element that regulates the expression of several genes within a chromosomal domain. LCRs were first identified at the $\beta$-globin gene locus, which encodes the $\beta$-type subunits of hemoglobin. Together with $\alpha$-type subunits, these $\beta$-globin-like subunits form embryonic, fetal, and adult hemoglobin (see Box 29-1). The $\beta$-globin gene locus consists of a cluster of five genes ( $\varepsilon, \gamma_{c}, \gamma_{s}, \delta, \beta$ ) that are distributed over 90 kilobases ( kb ) on chromosome 11. (5) N4-5 During ontogeny, the genes exhibit highly regulated patterns of expression in which they are transcribed only in certain tissues and only at precise developmental stages. Thus, embryonic globin ( $\varepsilon$ ) is expressed in the yolk sac, fetal globins $\left(\gamma_{c}, \gamma_{s}\right)$ are expressed in fetal liver, and adult globins $(\delta, \beta)$ are expressed in adult bone marrow. This
tightly regulated expression pattern requires a regulatory region that is located far from the structural genes. This region, designated the LCR, extends from 6 to 18 kb upstream from the $\varepsilon$-globin gene. The LCR is essential for high-level expression of the $\beta$-globin-like genes within red blood cell precursors because the promoters and enhancers near the individual genes permit only low-level expression.

The $\beta$-globin LCR contains five sites, each with an enhancer-like structure that consists of modules of simple sequence elements that are binding sites for the erythrocytespecific transcription factors GATA-1 and NF-E2. It is believed that the LCRs perform two functions: one is to alter the chromatin structure of the $\beta$-globin gene locus so that it is more accessible to transcription factors, and the second is to serve as a powerful enhancer of transcription of the individual genes. In one model, temporally dependent expression of $\beta$-type globin genes is achieved by sequential interactions involving activator proteins that bind to the LCR and promoters of individual genes (Fig. 4-7).

A potential problem associated with the existence of LCRs that can exert transcriptional effects over long distances is that the LCRs may interfere with the expression of nearby genes. One solution to this problem is provided by insulator elements, which function to isolate genes from neighboring regulatory elements. Insulator elements may represent sites of attachment of DNA to the chromosome scaffold, generating loops of physically separated DNA that may correspond to discrete functional domains. A

Figure 4-7 Cis-acting elements that regulate gene transcription. This model shows a loop of chromatin that contains genes $A, B$, and $C$. The matrix-attachment region (MAR) is an insulator element on the DNA. Matrixattachment regions attach to the chromosome scaffold and thus isolate this loop of chromatin from other chromosomal domains. Contained within this loop are several cis-acting elements (i.e., DNA sequences that regulate genes on the same piece of DNA), including promoters, enhancers, negative regulatory elements, and the LCR.

## BOX 4-1 Abnormalities of Regulatory Elements in $\beta$-Thalassemias

The best-characterized mutations affecting DNA regulatory elements occur at the gene cluster encoding the $\beta$-globin-like chains of hemoglobin. Some of these mutations result in thalassemia, whereas others cause hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin. The $\beta$-thalassemias are a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by anemia caused by a deficiency in production of the $\beta$ chain of hemoglobin. The anemia can be mild and inconsequential or severe and life-threatening. The thalassemias were among the first diseases to be characterized at the molecular level. As noted on page 80, the $\beta$-globin gene locus consists of five $\beta$-globinlike genes that are exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells and exhibit temporal colinearity. $\boldsymbol{\Theta} \mathbf{N} 4-\mathbf{S}$ As expected, many patients with $\beta$-thalassemia have mutations or deletions that affect the coding region of the $\beta$-globin gene. These patients presumably have thalassemia because the $\beta$-globin gene product is functionally abnormal or absent. In addition, some patients have a deficiency in $\beta$-globin as a result of inadequate levels of expression of the gene. Of particular interest are patients with the Hispanic and Dutch forms of $\beta$-thalassemia. These patients have deletions of portions of chromosome 11. However, the deletions do not extend to include the $\beta$-globin gene itself. Why, then, do these patients have $\beta$-globin deficiency? It turns out that the deletions involve the region 50 to 65 kb upstream from the $\beta$-globin gene, which contains the LCR. In these cases, deletion of the LCR results in failure of expression of the $\beta$-globin gene, even though the structural gene and its promoter are completely normal. These results underscore the essential role that the LCR plays in $\beta$-globin gene expression.
transcription factor called CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) binds to insulator elements and prevents interactions between regulatory elements and genes located on different sides of the insulator.

Figure 4-7 summarizes our understanding of the arrangement of cis-acting regulatory elements and their functions. Each gene has its own promoter where transcription is initiated. Enhancers are positively acting regulatory elements that may be located either near or distant from the transcription initiation site; silencers are regulatory elements that inhibit gene expression. A cluster of genes within a chromosomal domain may be under the control of an LCR. Finally, insulator elements functionally separate one chromosomal domain from another.

## TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS

## DNA-binding transcription factors recognize specific DNA sequences

The preceding discussion has emphasized the structure of the gene and the cis-acting elements that regulate gene expression. We now turn to the proteins that interact with these DNA elements and thus regulate gene transcription. Because the basal transcriptional machinery-Pol II and the general transcription factors-is incapable of efficient gene transcription alone, additional proteins are required to

stimulate the activity of the enzyme complex. The additional proteins include transcription factors that recognize and bind to specific DNA sequences (enhancers) located near their target genes, as well as others (see pp. 83-84) that do not bind to DNA.

Examples of DNA-binding transcription factors are shown in Table 4-1. The general mechanism of action of a specific transcription factor is depicted in Figure 4-6. After the basal transcriptional machinery assembles on the gene promoter, it can interact with a transcription factor that binds to a specific DNA element, the enhancer (or silencer). Looping out of the intervening DNA permits physical interaction between the activator (or repressor) and the basal transcriptional machinery, which subsequently leads to stimulation (or inhibition) of gene transcription. The specificity with which transcription factors bind to DNA depends on the interactions between the amino-acid side chains of the transcription factor and the purine and pyrimidine bases in DNA. Most of these interactions consist of noncovalent hydrogen bonds between amino acids and DNA bases. A peptide capable of a specific pattern of hydrogen bonding can recognize and bind to the reciprocal pattern in the major (and to a lesser extent the minor) groove of DNA. Interaction with the DNA backbone may also occur and involves electrostatic interactions (salt bridge formation) with anionic phosphate groups. The site that a transcription factor recognizes (see Table 4-1) is generally short, usually less than a dozen or so base pairs.

DNA-binding transcription factors do not recognize single, unique DNA sequences; rather, they recognize a family of closely related sequences. For example, the transcription factor AP-1 (activator protein 1) recognizes the sequences

5'-TGACTCA-3'
5'-TGAGTCA-3'
5'-TGAGTCT-3'
and so on, as well as each of the complementary sequences. That is, some redundancy is usually built into the recognition

![bo664543376c](bo664543376c.jpg)

Figure 4-8 Modular design of specific transcription factors. A, DNA-binding transcription factors have independent domains for binding to DNA regulatory sequences and for activating transcription. In this example, amino acids 1 through 147 of the GAL4 yeast transcription factor bind to DNA, whereas amino acids 768 through 881 activate transcription. B, Replacement of the transactivation domain of GAL4 with that of VP16 results in a chimera that is a functional transcription factor.
sequence for a transcription factor. An important consequence of these properties is that the recognition site for a transcription factor may occur many times in the genome. For example, if a transcription factor recognizes a 6-bp sequence, the sequence would be expected to occur once every $4^{6}$ (or 4096) base pairs, that is, $7 \times 10^{5}$ times in the human genome. If redundancy is permitted, recognition sites will occur even more frequently. Of course, most of these sites will not be relevant to gene regulation but will instead have occurred simply by chance. This high frequency of recognition sites leads to an important concept: transcription factors act in combination. Thus, high-level expression of a gene requires that a combination of multiple transcription factors bind to multiple regulatory elements. Although it is complicated, this system ensures that transcription activation occurs only at appropriate locations. Moreover, this system permits greater fine-tuning of the system, inasmuch as the activity of individual transcription factors can be altered to modulate the overall level of transcription of a gene.

An important general feature of DNA-binding transcription factors is their modular construction (Fig. 4-8A). Transcription factors may be divided into discrete domains that bind DNA (DNA-binding domains) and domains that activate transcription (transactivation domains). (○) N4-6 This property was first directly demonstrated for a yeast transcription factor known as GAL4, which activates certain genes when yeast grows in galactose-containing media. GAL4 has two domains. One is a so-called zinc finger (see p. 82) that mediates sequence-specific binding to DNA. The other domain is enriched in acidic amino acids (i.e., glutamate and aspartate) and is necessary for transcriptional activation. This "acidic blob" domain of GAL4 can be removed and replaced with the transactivation domain from a different transcription factor VP16 (see Fig. 4-8B). The resulting GAL4-VP16 chimera binds to the same DNA sequence as normal GAL4 but mediates transcriptional activation via the VP16 transactivation domain. This type of "domain-swapping" experiment indicates that transcription factors have a modular construction in which physically
distinct domains mediate binding to DNA and transcriptional activation (or repression).

## Transcription factors that bind to DNA can be grouped into families based on tertiary structure

On the basis of sequence conservation as well as structural determinations from x-ray crystallography and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, DNA-binding transcription factors have been grouped into families. Members of the same family use common structural motifs for binding DNA (see Table 4-1). These structures include the zinc finger, basic zipper, basic helix-loop-helix, helix-turn-helix, and $\beta$ sheet. Each of these motifs consists of a particular tertiary protein structure in which a component, usually an $\alpha$ helix, interacts with DNA, especially the major groove of the DNA.

Zinc Finger The term zinc finger describes a loop of protein held together at its base by a zinc ion that tetrahedrally coordinates to either two histidine residues and two cysteine residues or four cysteine residues. Sometimes two zinc ions coordinate to six cysteine groups. Figure 4-9A shows a zinc finger in which $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ coordinates to two residues on an $\alpha$ helix and two residues on a $\beta$ sheet of the protein. The loop (or finger) of protein can protrude into the major groove of DNA, where amino-acid side chains can interact with the base pairs and thereby confer the capacity for sequence-specific DNA binding. Zinc fingers consist of 30 amino acids with the consensus sequences Cys- $\mathrm{X}_{2-4}$-Cys- $\mathrm{X}_{12}$ His- $\mathrm{X}_{5-7}$-His, where X can be any amino acid. Transcription factors of this family contain at least two zinc fingers and may contain dozens. Three amino-acid residues at the tips of each zinc finger contact a DNA subsite that consists of three bases in the major groove of DNA; these residues are responsible for site recognition and binding (see Table 4-1). Zinc fingers are found in many mammalian transcription factors, including several that we discuss in this chapter-Egr-1, Wilms tumor protein (WT-1), and Sp1 (see Table 4-1)—as well as the steroid-hormone receptors (see p. 71).

Figure 4-9 Structures of transcription factors.

Basic Zipper Also known as the leucine zipper family, the basic zipper (bZIP) family consists of transcription factors that bind to DNA as dimers (see Fig. 4-9B). Members include C/EBP $\beta$ (CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein- $\beta$ ), c-Fos, c-Jun, and CREB. Each monomer consist of two domains, a basic region that contacts DNA and a leucine zipper region that mediates dimerization. The basic region contains about 30 amino acids and is enriched in arginine and lysine residues. This region is responsible for sequencespecific binding to DNA via an $\alpha$ helix that inserts into the major groove of DNA. The leucine zipper consists of a region of about 30 amino acids in which every seventh residue is a leucine. Because of this spacing, the leucine residues align on a common face every second turn of an $\alpha$ helix. Two protein subunits that both contain leucine zippers can associate because of hydrophobic interactions between the leucine side chains; they form a tertiary structure called a coiled coil. Proteins of this family interact with DNA as homodimers or as structurally related heterodimers. Dimerization is essential for transcriptional activity because mutations of the leucine residues abolish both dimer formation and the ability to bind DNA and activate transcription. The crystal structure reveals that these transcription factors resemble scissors in which the blades represent the leucine zipper domains and the handles represent the DNA-binding domains (see Fig. 4-9B).

Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Similar to the bZIP family, members of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of transcription factors also bind to DNA as dimers. Each monomer has an extended $\alpha$-helical segment containing the basic region that contacts DNA, linked by a loop to a second $\alpha$ helix that mediates dimer formation (see Fig. 4-9C). Thus, the bHLH transcription factor forms by association of four amphipathic $\alpha$ helices (two from each monomer) into a bundle. The basic domains of each monomer protrude into the major grooves on opposite sides of the DNA. bHLH proteins include the MyoD family, which is involved in muscle differentiation, and E proteins (E12 and E47). MyoD and an E protein generally bind to DNA as heterodimers. (5) N4-7

Helix-Turn-Helix Homeodomain proteins that regulate embryonic development are members of the helix-turn-helix (HTH) family (see Fig. 4-9D). The homeodomain consists of a 60 -amino-acid sequence that forms three $\alpha$ helices. Helices 1 and 2 lie adjacent to one another, and helix 3 is perpendicular and forms the DNA-recognition helix. Particular amino acids protrude from the recognition helix and contact bases in the major groove of the DNA. Examples of homeodomain proteins include the Hox proteins, which are involved in mammalian pattern formation; engrailed homologs, which are important in nervous system development; and the POU family members Pit-1, Oct-1, and unc-86. 6 N4-8

The MyoD family of transcription factors includes MyoD itself as well as myogenin, myf5, and MRF4. All are involved in controlling the differentiation of muscle. MyoD and an E protein generally bind to DNA as heterodimers.

Some bHLH transcription factors contain additional domains-located immediately adjacent to the HLH domainthat mediate protein dimerization. A leucine zipper motif is contained in bHLH-Zip proteins such as c-Myc and SREBP, and a PAS domain is contained in bHLH-PAS proteins such as HIF-1 $\alpha$.

## N4-8 Novel Families of Transcription Factors

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

On pages 82-83 we describe four families of transcription factors: zinc finger, bZIP, bHLH, and HTH. In each case, an $\alpha$ helix in the transcription factor binds in the major groove of the DNA. Some transcription factors use an antiparallel $\beta$-pleated sheet for DNA binding. The $\beta$ sheet fills the major groove of DNA, and amino-acid side chains that are exposed on the face of the $\beta$ sheet contact the DNA bases.

In addition to transcription factors that bind to DNA via $\beta$-pleated sheets, there are several other transcription factors that do not appear to fall into one of the four structural families listed on pages 82-83. Thus, it seems likely that other structural motifs can also mediate DNA binding. One example is the forkhead domain. It is also important to note that some transcription factors bind to DNA through more than one domain. Examples include the POU family, in which the POUspecific domain is required in addition to the POU homeodomain for DNA binding.

proteins are called coactivators. Coactivators work in concert with DNA-binding transcriptional activators to stimulate gene transcription. They function as adapters or protein intermediaries that form protein-protein interactions between activators bound to enhancers and the basal transcriptional machinery assembled on the gene promoter (see Fig. 4-6). Coactivators often contain distinct domains, one that interacts with the transactivation domain of an activator and a second that interacts with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Transcription factors that interact with repressors and play an analogous role in transcriptional repression are called corepressors.

One of the first coactivators found in eukaryotes was the VP16 herpesvirus protein discussed above (see Fig. 4-88). VP16 has two domains. The first is a transactivation domain that contains a region of acidic amino acids that in turn interacts with two components of the basal transcriptional machinery, general transcription factors TFIIB and TFIID. The other domain of VP16 interacts with the ubiquitous activator Oct-1, which recognizes a DNA sequence called the octamer motif (see Table 4-1). Thus, VP16 activates transcription by bridging an activator and the basal transcriptional machinery.

Some coactivators play a general role in the activation of transcription. One example is Mediator, a multiprotein complex consisting of 28 to 30 subunits, which is not required for basal transcription but is essential for transcriptional activation by most activator proteins. Consistent with its essential role, Mediator is present in the basal transcriptional machinery or preinitiation complex.

Another type of coactivator is involved in transcriptional activation by specific transcription factors. This type of coactivator is not a component of the basal transcriptional machinery. Rather, these coactivators are recruited by a DNA-binding transcriptional activator through proteinprotein interactions. An example is the coactivator CBP (CREB-binding protein), which interacts with a DNAbinding transcription factor called CREB (see Table 4-1).

## Transcriptional activators stimulate transcription by three mechanisms

Once transcriptional activators bind to enhancers (i.e., positive regulatory elements on the DNA) and recruit coactivators, how do they stimulate gene transcription? We discuss three mechanisms by which transactivation might be achieved. These mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and more than one mechanism may be involved in the transcription of a particular gene.

Recruitment of the Basal Transcriptional Machinery We have already introduced the concept by which looping out of DNA (see pp. 79-80) permits proteins that are bound to distant DNA enhancer elements to become physically juxtaposed to proteins that are bound to the gene promoter (Fig. 4-10, pathway 1). The interaction between the DNA-binding transcription factor and general transcription factors, perhaps with coactivators as protein intermediaries, enhances the recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery to the promoter. Two general transcription factors, TFIID and TFIIB, are targets for recruitment by transcriptional

Figure 4-10 Mechanisms of transcriptional activation. The transcriptional activator binds to the enhancer and directly or indirectly (via coactivators) activates transcription by recruiting RNA polymerase to the promoter (1), recruiting HATs that remodel chromatin (2), or stimulating the phosphorylation of the CTD of RNA polymerase (3).
activators. For example, the acidic transactivation domain of VP16 binds to TFIIB, and mutations that prevent the interaction between VP16 and TFIIB also abolish transcriptional activation. Conversely, mutations of TFIIB that eliminate the interaction with an acidic activator also abolish transactivation but have little effect on basal transcription.

Chromatin Remodeling A second mechanism by which transcriptional activators may function is alteration of chromatin structure. Gene transcription first requires local disruption of the regular nucleosome structure of chromatin (see p. 76) so that the basal transcriptional machinery can access the promoter and initiate RNA synthesis. One mechanism of chromatin remodeling involves histone acetylation. Acetylation of lysine residues in histones (see p. 88) weakens the electrostatic interaction between histones and the negatively charged DNA. Histone acetyltransferases (HATs) are enzymes that acetylate histones and thus produce local alterations in chromatin structure that are more favorable for transcription. Transcriptional activators may recruit HATs either directly or indirectly through coactivators (see Fig. 4-10, pathway 2). Alternatively, some coactivator proteins that mediate transcriptional activation possess intrinsic histone acetylase activity.

Another mechanism of chromatin remodeling involves the SWI/SNF family of proteins. SWI/SNF (switching mating type/sucrose nonfermenting) are large multiprotein complexes, initially identified in yeast but evolutionarily conserved in all animals. SWI/SNF chromatin-remodeling complexes can inhibit the association between DNA and histones by using the energy of ATP to peel the DNA away from the histones and thereby make this DNA more accessible to transcription factors. Some transcriptional activators promote chromatin remodeling by binding and recruiting subunits of the SWI/SNF complex.

Stimulation of Pol II A third mechanism by which transcriptional activators function is by stimulating RNA polymerase II (see Fig. 4-10, pathway 3). The C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit of Pol II contains 52 repeats of the sequence Tyr-Ser-Pro-Thr-Ser-Pro-Ser, which can be phosphorylated at multiple serine and threonine residues. A cyclin-dependent kinase called positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) phosphorylates the CTD. (○) N4-9 Phosphorylation of the CTD occurs coincident with initiation of transcription and is required for chain elongation. Thus, transcriptional activators that interact with P-TEFb may stimulate the conversion of the Pol II holoenzyme from an initiation complex into an elongation complex.

Taken together, these three mechanisms of interaction lead to the following model for activation of transcription. A transcription factor that is bound to an enhancer presents a functional domain (e.g., an acidic domain) that either directly or via coactivators interacts with chromatinremodeling enzymes and components of the basal transcriptional machinery. These interactions facilitate the assembly of the basal transcriptional machinery on the gene promoter and thereby stimulate the initial transcription of RNA. Subsequent interactions-with the CTD of Pol II, for example-may promote elongation of the nascent RNA transcript.

## Transcriptional activators act in combination

Two or more activators may increase the rate of transcription by an amount that is greater than the sum of the amounts for each of the activators alone. Almost all naturally occurring promoters contain more than one site for binding of transcriptional activators. A promoter region that contains only a single copy of an enhancer element shows only weak stimulation, whereas a promoter containing multiple copies of an enhancer exhibits substantial activation (Fig. 4-11). Two mechanisms for synergy have been proposed.

In the first, synergy may reflect cooperative binding to DNA; that is, binding of one transcription factor to its recognition site enhances binding of a second transcription factor to a different site. This phenomenon occurs with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which binds to a site on DNA known as the glucocorticoid response element (GRE). Binding of GRs to the multiple GREs is cooperative in that binding of the first receptor promotes binding of additional receptors. Thus, the presence of multiple copies of the GRE greatly stimulates gene expression in comparison to a single copy of the GRE.

In the second case, synergy reflects cooperative proteinprotein interactions between transcription factors and multiple sites on the basal transcriptional machinery. For example, a transcriptional activator that recruits TFIID could synergize with another activator that recruits TFIIB. Similarly, a transcriptional activator that interacts with a HAT could synergize with another activator that interacts with components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Here, the effect on transcription depends on the cumulative effects of multiple transcription factors, each bound to its cognate recognition site and interacting with chromatin-remodeling proteins and the basal transcriptional machinery.
![bo704543376c](bo704543376c.jpg)

Figure 4-11 Synergism of transcriptional activators. The promoter contains three DNA enhancer elements $A, B$, and $C$. Binding of a transcription factor to only one of the enhancer elements ( $A, B$, or $C$ ) causes a modest activation of transcription. Simultaneous binding of different transcription factors to each of the three enhancer elements can produce a supra-additive increase in transcription (i.e., synergy).

Transcription factors may act in combination by binding to DNA as homodimers or heterodimers. This synergism is particularly true for members of the bZIP and bHLH families but also for steroid and thyroid hormone receptors. Often, different combinations of monomers have different DNA-binding affinities. For example, the thyroid hormone receptor (TR) can bind to DNA as a homodimer, but the heterodimer formed from the TR and the retinoid X receptor (TR/RXR) has much higher binding affinity. The transcription factor MyoD (see p. 83), which is involved in muscle differentiation, requires heterodimerization with a ubiquitous E protein (e.g., E12 or E47) for maximal DNA binding. Different combinations of monomers may also have different DNA-binding specificities and thus be targeted to different sites on the DNA. Finally, different combinations of monomers may have different transactivational properties. For example, the c-Myc protein can bind to DNA as a homodimer or as a heterodimer with Max, but c-Myc/Max heterodimers have greater transcriptional activity.

## Transcriptional repressors act by competition, quenching, or active repression

Cells can regulate transcription not only positively via transcriptional activators but also negatively via transcriptional repressors. (○) N4-10 Repression of transcription is important for tissue specificity in that it allows cells to silence certain genes where they should not be expressed. Repression is also important for regulating inducible gene expression by

# N4-9 Phosphorylation of the CTD 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

The CTD of the largest subunit of Pol II can be phosphorylated in vitro by TFIIH and by cdc2 kinase (a regulatory component of the cell cycle). However, the identity of the kinase that is responsible for phosphorylation of the CTD in vivo remains uncertain. There is some evidence that phosphorylation of the CTD may mediate responses to viral transcriptional activators, such as VP16.

rapidly turning off transcription after removal of the inducing stimulus.

Transcriptional repressors may act by three mechanisms. First, some repressors inhibit the binding of transcriptional activators because they compete for DNA-binding sites that are identical to, or overlap with, those for activators. An example is the CCAAT displacement protein (CDP), which binds to the CAAT box in the promoter of the $\gamma$-globin gene and thereby prevents binding of the transcriptional activator CP1. This action helps prevent inappropriate expression of the fetal globin gene in adults.

Second, some repressors inhibit the activity of transcriptional activators not by interference with DNA binding but by a direct protein-protein interaction with activators. This form of repression is termed quenching. A classic example in yeast is the GAL80 repressor, which inhibits transcriptional activation by GAL4. By binding to the transactivation domain of GAL4, GAL80 blocks transcriptional activation. Dissociation of GAL80 (which occurs in the presence of galactose) relieves the inhibition of GAL4, which can then induce expression of galactose-metabolizing genes. Transcriptional repression can also be mediated by proteins that prevent transcriptional activators from entering the nucleus. For example, the heat shock protein hsp90 binds to GR and prevents this transcriptional activator from entering the nucleus.

A third class of repressors binds to a silencer (or NRE) and then directly inhibits transcription. This mechanism is referred to as active repression. The opposite of transcriptional activators, these proteins contain domains that mediate repression. Repression domains may directly interact with and inhibit the assembly or activity of the basal transcriptional machinery. Alternatively, transcriptional repressors
may inhibit transcription through protein-protein interactions with corepressors. We have previously seen that transcriptional activators may function by recruiting histone acetylases (HATs) that remodel chromatin and facilitate the initiation of RNA synthesis. Conversely, histone deacetylases (HDACs) are enzymes that remove the acetyl groups from histones, which leads to tighter binding to DNA and inhibition of transcription. Some transcriptional corepressors, such as the N-CoR adapter protein that mediates repression by steroid hormone receptors, can interact with HDAC.

## The activity of transcription factors may be regulated by post-translational modifications

Cells can regulate the activity of transcription factors by controlling the amount of transcription factor they synthesize. In addition, cells can modulate the activity of preformed transcription factors by three general mechanisms of posttranslational modification (Table 4-2).

Phosphorylation The best-studied post-translational modification affecting transcription factor activity is phosphorylation, which increases or decreases (1) transport of the transcription factor from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, (2) the affinity with which the transcription factor binds to DNA, and (3) transcriptional activation.

For transcription factors that reside in the cytoplasm under basal conditions, migration from the cytoplasm into the nucleus is a necessary step. Many proteins that are transported into the nucleus contain a sequence that is relatively enriched in basic amino-acid residues (i.e., arginine and lysine). This sequence, the nuclear localization

Figure 4-12 Regulation of transcription factors by post-translational modification. A, The phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic anchor IкB releases the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- $\kappa B$, which allows them to translocate into the nucleus. B, Proteolytic cleavage of a 105-kDa precursor releases the p50 subunit of NF- $\kappa B$. Together with the p65 subunit, the p50 subunit can now translocate to the nucleus.
signal, is required for transport of the protein into the nucleus. Phosphorylation at sites within or near the nuclear localization signal can dramatically change the rate of nuclear translocation. Phosphorylation can also modulate import into the nucleus by regulating the binding of transcription factors to cytoplasmic anchors. In the case of the transcription factor nuclear factor $\kappa B$ (NF- $\boldsymbol{\kappa B}$; Fig. 4-12A), binding to a cytoplasmic anchor called inhibitor of $\kappa B$ (IкB) conceals the nuclear localization signal on the p50 and p65 subunits of NF- $\kappa B$ from the nuclear translocation machinery. Only after these two other subunits dissociate from the phosphorylated IкB is the transcription factor dimer free to enter the nucleus.

Phosphorylation can also regulate transcription factor activity by altering the affinity of the transcription factor for its target recognition sequences on DNA. As a result, phosphorylation increases or decreases DNA-binding activity. For example, phosphorylation of SRF (serum response factor), a transcription factor that activates the c-fos gene in response to growth factors, enhances DNA binding. In contrast, phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun by casein kinase II inhibits binding to DNA.

Phosphorylation can greatly influence the transactivation properties of transcription factors. c-Jun is an example of a transcription factor whose transcriptional activity is increased by the phosphorylation of serine residues located within the transactivation domain near the N terminus of the protein. Phosphorylation of a transcriptional activator may stimulate its activity by increasing its binding affinity for a coactivator. Phosphorylation can also inhibit
transcriptional activation by reducing transcriptional activation or stimulating active transcriptional repression.

Effects of phosphorylation on nuclear translocation, DNA binding, and transactivation are not mutually exclusive. Moreover, not only phosphorylation by protein kinases but also dephosphorylation by protein phosphatases may regulate transcriptional activity.

Site-Specific Proteolysis Many transcription factors undergo proteolytic cleavage at specific amino-acid residues, particularly in response to exogenous signals. Site-specific proteolysis often converts an inactive precursor protein into an active transcriptional regulator. One example is NF- $\kappa B$. Although phosphorylation can regulate NF- $\kappa B$ by controlling its binding to IкB (see Fig. 4-12A), proteolysis can also regulate NF- $\kappa B$ (see Fig. 4-12B). A 105-kDa precursor of the $50-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit of NF- $\kappa \mathrm{B}$ (p50), which we mentioned above, binds to and thereby retains the $65-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit of NF- $\kappa \mathrm{B}$ (p65) in the cytoplasm. Proteolysis of this larger precursor yields the $50-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit that together with the $65-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit constitutes the active NF- $\kappa B$ transcription factor.

Another form of site-specific proteolysis, which creates active transcription factors from inactive membranetethered precursors, is called regulated intramembranous proteolysis (RIP). One example is the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP), a membrane protein that normally resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. In response to depletion of cellular cholesterol, SREBP undergoes RIP, which releases an N -terminal fragment containing a bHLH motif. The proteolytic fragment translocates to the

Other Post-Translational Modifications In addition to phosphate groups, a variety of other covalent attachments can affect the activity of transcription factors (Table 4-3). These small molecules-such as acetyl groups, methyl groups, sugars or peptides, hydroxyl groups, or nitro groups-attach to specific amino-acid residues in the transcription factor. Post-translational modifications of transcription factors can affect their stability, intracellular localization, dimerization, DNA-binding properties, or interactions with coactivators. For example, acetylation of lysine residues in the p53 transcription factor increases binding to DNA and inhibits degradation. Methylation of an arginine residue in the coactivator CBP inhibits its interaction with the transcription factor CREB. O-linked glycosylation, a covalent modification in which sugar groups attach to serine or threonine residues, stimulates NF- $\kappa B$. Ubiquitin is a small peptide that is covalently attached to lysine groups in proteins. Addition of multiple ubiquitin groups (polyubiquitination) frequently results in degradation of the protein via the proteasome (see pp. 33-34). However, addition of a single ubiquitin group (monoubiquitination) may stimulate the activity of a transcription factor, perhaps by increasing its affinity for transcriptional elongation factors. Conversely, sumoylation, covalent modification of lysine residues with small ubiquitin-like modifiers (SUMOs), may inhibit activity by altering the localization of a transcription factor within the nucleus. As we will see in the next section, extracellular signals often trigger post-translational modifications to regulate the activity of transcription factors.

## The expression of some transcription factors is tissue specific

Some transcription factors are ubiquitous, either because these transcription factors regulate the transcription of genes that are expressed in many different tissues or because they are required for the transcription of many different genes.

Examples of ubiquitous transcription factors are the DNA-binding transcription factors Sp1 and NF-Y, which bind to regulatory elements (i.e., GC boxes and CCAAT boxes, respectively-see p. 79) that are present in many gene promoters. Other transcription factors are present only in certain tissues or cell types; these transcription factors are involved in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression.

Tissue-specific activators bind to enhancers present in the promoters and regulatory regions of genes that are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. Conversely, tissue-specific repressors bind to silencers that prevent transcription of a gene in nonexpressing tissues. Each tissue-specific transcription factor can regulate the expression of multiple genes. Because the short sequences of enhancers and silencers may occur by chance, the combined effect of multiple transcription factors-each binding to distinct regulatory elements near the gene-prevents illegitimate transcription in nonexpressing tissues. In addition to being activated by transcriptional activators, tissue-specific gene expression may also be regulated by transcriptional repression. In this case, transcriptional repressors prevent transcription of a gene in nonexpressing tissues. Tissue-specific expression probably also involves permanent silencing of nonexpressed genes through epigenetic modifications, such as DNA methylation (see pp. 95-96).

Pit-1 is an HTH-type tissue-specific transcription factor that regulates the pituitary-specific expression of genes encoding growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and prolactin. MyoD and myogenin are bHLH-type transcription factors that bind to the E-box sequence CANNTG of promoters and enhancers of many genes expressed in skeletal muscle, such as myosin heavy chain and muscle creatine kinase. EKLF as well as GATA-1 and NF-E2 mediate the erythroid-specific expression of $\beta$-globin genes. The combined effects of HNF-1, HNF-3, HNF-4, C/EBP, and other transcription factors-each of which may individually be present in several tissues-mediate the liver-specific expression of genes such as albumin and $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin. Many tissue-specific transcription factors play important roles in embryonic development. For example, myogenin is required for skeletal muscle differentiation, and GATA-1 is required for the development of erythroid cells.

# N4-11 Examples of RIP 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

In addition to SREBP noted in the text, other proteins that undergo RIP are Notch and APP-all span the membrane at least once.

Notch is a plasma membrane receptor whose cytoplasmic domain is released in response to Delta, a membrane-bound ligand that regulates cell fate during development.

Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a protein of unknown function that is cleaved in the membrane to produce the extracellular amyloid $\beta$ peptide implicated in Alzheimer disease. For Notch and APP, the intramembrane cleavage does not take place until a primary cleavage event removes the bulk of the protein on the extracytoplasmic face. Although the cleaved sites differ in these proteins, the net effect of the first step is to shorten the extracytoplasmic domain to <30 amino acids, which allows the second cleavage to release a portion of the cytoplasmic domain.

The epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel ENaC-a heterotrimer that consists of $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits-also undergoes intramembrane proteolysis. While the ENaC is still in the vesicular subcompartment of the secretory pathway, the protease furin cleaves the extracellular domain of the $\alpha$ subunit twice (after consensus RXXR motifs), releasing a peptide of 26 amino acids. By itself, this modification increases the open probability of ENaC to $\sim 0.30$. Furin also cleaves the $\gamma$ subunit, but only once. A variety of extracellular proteases-including prostasin, elastase, and plasmin-can make a second cut after the protein has reached the plasma membrane. The result of the $\gamma$-subunit cleavages is to increase the open probability to nearly 1.0. Thus, both examples of proteolysis greatly increase the activity of the channel.

## REGULATION OF INDUCIBLE GENE EXPRESSION BY SIGNAL-TRANSDUCTION PATHWAYS

How do cells activate previously quiescent genes in response to environmental cues? How are such external signals transduced to the cell nucleus to stimulate the transcription of specific genes? Transcription factors may be thought of as effector molecules in signal-transduction pathways (see Chapter 3) that modulate gene expression. Several such signaling pathways have been defined. Lipid-soluble steroid and thyroid hormones can enter the cell and interact with specific receptors that are themselves transcription factors. However, most cytokines, hormones, and mitogens cannot diffuse into the cell interior and instead bind to specific receptors that are located on the cell surface. First, we consider three pathways for transducing signals from cell-surface receptors into the nucleus: a cAMP-dependent pathway, a Ras-dependent pathway, and the JAK-STAT pathway. Next, we examine the mechanisms by which steroid or thyroid hormones act via nuclear receptors. Finally, we discuss how transcription factors coordinate gene expression in response to physiological stimuli.

## cAMP regulates transcription via the transcription factors CREB and CBP

cAMP is an important second messenger (see p. 57) in the response to agonists binding to specific cell-surface receptors. Increases in [cAMP]_{i} stimulate the transcription of certain genes, including those that encode a variety of hormones, such as somatostatin (see pp. 993-994), the enkephalins (see p.315), glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (see Table 41-1). Many genes that are activated in response to cAMP contain within their regulatory regions a common DNA element called CRE (cAMP response element) that has the consensus sequence $5^{\prime}$-TGACGTCA-3'. Several different transcription factors bind to CRE, among them CREB (cAMP response elementbinding protein), a $43-\mathrm{kDa}$ member of the bZIP family. As shown in Figure 4-13, increases in [cAMP]_{i} stimulate protein kinase A (PKA) by causing dissociation of the PKA regulatory subunit. The catalytic subunit of PKA then translocates into the nucleus, where it phosphorylates CREB and other proteins. Activation of CREB is rapid ( 30 minutes) and declines gradually during a 24 -hour period. This phosphorylation greatly increases the affinity of CREB for the coactivator CBP, which is a $245-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein containing two domains, one that binds to phosphorylated CREB and another that activates components of the basal transcriptional machinery. Thus, CBP serves as a "bridge" protein that communicates the transcriptional activation signal from CREB to the basal transcriptional machinery. In addition, because CBP has intrinsic HAT activity (see p. 84), its recruitment by CREB also results in chromatin remodeling that facilitates gene transcription. The result of phosphorylation of CREB is a 10 - to 20 -fold stimulation of CREB's ability to induce the transcription of genes containing a CRE.

How is the transcriptional signal terminated? When [cAMP] is high, PKA phosphorylates and activates phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 in the nucleus. When cAMP

levels fall, the still-active phosphatase dephosphorylates CREB.

## Receptor tyrosine kinases regulate transcription via a Ras-dependent cascade of protein kinases

Many growth factors bind to cell-surface receptors that, when activated by the ligand, have tyrosine kinase activity (see pp. 70-71). Examples of growth factors that act through such receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are epidermal growth factor (EGF), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), insulin, insulin-like growth factor type 1 (IGF-1), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and nerve growth factor (NGF). The common

pathway by which activation of RTKs is transduced into the nucleus is a cascade of events that increase the activity of the small GTP-binding protein Ras (see pp. 68). This Ras-dependent signaling pathway culminates in the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), which translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates a number of nuclear proteins that are transcription factors. Phosphorylation of a transcription factor by MAPK can enhance or inhibit binding to DNA and can stimulate either transactivation or transrepression. (5) N4-12 Transcription factors that are regulated by the Ras-dependent pathway include c-Myc, c-Jun, c-Fos, and Elk-1. Many of these transcription factors regulate the expression of genes that promote cell proliferation.

## Tyrosine kinase-associated receptors can regulate transcription via JAK-STAT

A group of cell-surface receptors termed tyrosine kinaseassociated receptors lack intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity (see pp. 70-71). The ligands that bind to these receptors include several cytokines, growth hormone, prolactin, and interferons (IFN- $\alpha$, IFN- $\beta$, and IFN- $\gamma$ ). Although the receptors themselves lack catalytic activity, their cytoplasmic domains are associated with the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine kinases.

Binding of ligand to certain tyrosine kinase-associated receptors activates a member of the JAK family, which results in phosphorylation of cytoplasmic proteins, among which are believed to be latent cytoplasmic transcription factors called signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). When phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, the STAT proteins dimerize and thereby become competent to enter the nucleus and induce transcription.

A well-characterized example of the JAK-STAT pathway is the activation of interferon-responsive genes by IFN- $\alpha$ and IFN- $\gamma$. IFN- $\alpha$ activates the JAK1 and Tyk2 kinases that are associated with its receptor (Fig. 4-14A). Subsequent phosphorylation of two different STAT monomers causes the monomers to dimerize. This STAT heterodimer enters the nucleus, where it combines with a third $48-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein to form a transcription factor that binds to a DNA sequence called the IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). In the case of IFN- $\gamma$ (see Fig. 4-14B), the receptor associates with the JAK1 and JAK2 (rather than Tyk2) kinases, and subsequent phosphorylation of a single kind of STAT monomer causes these monomers to dimerize. These STAT homodimers also enter the nucleus, where they bind to the DNA at IFN- $\gamma$ response elements called IFN- $\gamma$ activation sites (GASs), without requiring the $48-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein.

## Nuclear receptors are transcription factors

Steroid and thyroid hormones are examples of ligands that activate gene expression by binding to cellular receptors that are themselves transcription factors. Members of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily, also called the nuclear receptor superfamily, are grouped together because they are structurally similar and have similar mechanisms of action. After these hormones enter the cell, they bind to receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus. Ligand binding
converts the receptors into active transcription factors. The transcription factors bind to specific regulatory elements on the DNA, called hormone response elements, and activate the transcription of cis-linked genes. The family of nuclear receptors includes receptors that bind glucocorticoids (GR), mineralocorticoids (MR), estrogens (ER), progesterone (PR), androgens (AR), thyroid hormone (TR), vitamin D (VDR), retinoic acid (RAR), lipids (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor, PPAR), and 9-cis-retinoic acid (retinoid X receptor, RXR) as well as bile acids (bile acid receptor, FXR; see p. 964) and xenobiotics (steroid and xenobiotic receptor, SXR; constitutive androstane receptor, CAR; see p. 956).

With the exception of the thyroid hormones, the hormones that bind to these receptors are lipophilic molecules that enter cells by diffusion and do not require interaction with cell-surface receptors. The thyroid hormones differ in that they are electrically charged and may cross the cell membrane via transporters.

Modular Construction The nuclear receptors have a modular construction consisting of an N-terminal transactivation domain, a DNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal ligand-binding domain (see pp. 71-72). These receptors bind to specific DNA sequences through two zinc fingers (see p. 82), each of which contains four cysteine residues rather than the two histidines and two cysteines that are typical of many other zinc finger proteins (see Fig. 4-9A). Particularly important for DNA recognition is the P-box motif in the hormone receptor, a sequence of six amino acids at the C-terminal end of each finger. These P boxes make base pair contacts in the major groove of DNA and determine the DNA-binding specificities of the zinc finger.

Dimerization GR, MR, PR, ER, and AR bind to DNA as homodimers (see Table 3-6). The recognition sites for these receptors (except for ER) consist of two 6-bp DNA sequences that are separated by three other base pairs. The 6-bp DNA sequences, commonly called half-sites, represent binding sites for each zinc-finger monomer.

In contrast, other nuclear receptors preferentially bind to DNA as heterodimers formed with RXR, the receptor for 9-cis-retinoic acid. Examples of such heterodimers are VDR/ RXR, TR/RXR, RAR/RXR, and PPAR/RXR (see Table 3-6). Interestingly, these heterodimers work even in the absence of the ligand of RXR (i.e., 9-cis-retinoic acid). Only the non-RXR part of the dimer needs to be occupied by its hormone ligand. These heterodimers recognize a family of DNA sites containing a DNA sequence such as $5^{\prime}$-AGGTCA$3^{\prime}$, followed by a DNA spacer and then by a direct repeat of the previous 6-bp DNA sequence. Moreover, because VDR/ RXR, TR/RXR, and RAR/RXR may each recognize the same 6-bp sequences, binding specificity also depends on the length of the spacer between the direct repeats. The VDR/ RXR, TR/RXR, and RAR/RXR heterodimers preferentially recognize separations of $3 \mathrm{bp}, 4 \mathrm{bp}$, and 5 bp , respectively, between the repeats of $5^{\prime}$-AGGTCA-3'. This relationship forms the basis for the so-called 3-4-5 rule.

Activation of Transcription Ligand binding activates nuclear receptors through two main mechanisms: regulation

Figure 4-14 JAK-STAT pathway. A, Binding of a ligand such as IFN- $\alpha$ to a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor causes JAK1 and Tyk2 to phosphorylate themselves, the receptor, and two different STAT monomers. The phosphorylation of the STAT monomers leads to the formation of a heterodimer, which translocates to the nucleus and combines with a third protein (p48). The complex binds to ISRE and activates gene transcription. B, Binding of a ligand such as IFN- $\gamma$ to a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor causes JAK1 and JAK2 to phosphorylate themselves, the receptor, and two identical STAT monomers.

of subcellular localization and interactions with coactivators. Some nuclear receptors, such as GR, are normally located in the cytoplasm and are maintained in an inactive state by association with a cytoplasmic anchoring protein (Fig. 4-15A). The protein that retains GR in the cytoplasm is a molecular chaperone, the $90-\mathrm{kDa}$ heat shock protein hsp90. GR must bind to hsp90 to have a high affinity for a glucocorticoid hormone. When glucocorticoids bind to the GR, hsp90 dissociates from the GR and exposes a nuclear localization signal that permits the transport of GR into the nucleus. The receptor must remain hormone bound for receptor dimerization, which is a prerequisite for binding to the GRE on the DNA. Other receptors, such as TR, are normally already present in the nucleus before binding the
hormone (see Fig. 4-15B). For these receptors, binding of hormone is evidently not essential for dimerization or binding to DNA. However, ligand binding is necessary at a subsequent step for transactivation.

Although nuclear receptors may stimulate gene expression by interacting directly with components of the basal transcriptional machinery, full transcriptional activation requires coactivators that interact with the receptor in a ligand-dependent manner. More than 200 coactivators may interact directly or indirectly with nuclear receptors via mechanisms that include the following:

1. Recruitment of basal transcriptional machinery. Coactivators that belong to the SRC (steroid receptor coactivator)/p160 family bind only to the ligand-bound

![bo754543376c](bo754543376c.jpg)

B, The binding of thyroid hormone to a receptor in the nucleus leads to transactivation. The active transcription factor is a heterodimer of the TR and the RXR.
form of the receptor. On binding to the nuclear receptor, SRC/p160 coactivators recruit a second coactivator, CBP (see p. 84), which then promotes recruitment of the basal transcriptional machinery. Nuclear receptors also bind in a ligand-dependent manner to the coactivator TRAP220, a component of Mediator (see p. 84), which is part of the basal transcriptional machinery.
2. Binding to a chromatin-remodeling complex. Nuclear receptors also interact with Brg1 (Brahma-related gene 1), the central motor component of the chromatinremodeling complex SWI/SNF (see p. 84).
3. Histone acetylation. Several coactivators have enzymatic activities that mediate chromatin remodeling. Both SRC-1 and CBP have intrinsic HAT activity.
4. Histone methylation. The coactivator CARM1 is a methyltransferase that methylates specific arginine residues in histones, thereby enhancing transcriptional activation.
5. Ubiquitination. Nuclear receptors recruit components of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (see pp. 33-34 and 88) to the promoter region of nuclear receptor target genes. Ubiquitination appears to promote transcript elongation.

Repression of Transcription Nuclear receptors sometimes function as active repressors, perhaps acting by alternative
mechanisms. First, a receptor may form inactive heterodimers with other members of the nuclear receptor family. Second, a receptor may compete with other transcription factors for DNA-binding sites. For example, when the TRwithout bound thyroid hormone-interacts with its own DNA response element, the TR acts as a repressor. In addition, the TR receptor isoform $\operatorname{TR} \alpha$ can dimerize with one of the retinoic acid receptor isoforms (RXR $\beta$ ) to interfere with binding of ER to its response element. This competition may be one of the mechanisms by which retinoids inhibit estrogen-induced alterations in gene expression and growth in mammary tissue. Finally, nuclear receptors can also inhibit gene transcription by interacting with corepressors, such as N-CoR, Sin3A, and Sin3B. These corepressors can recruit HDACs that enhance nucleosome assembly, which results in transcriptional repression.

## Physiological stimuli can modulate transcription factors, which can coordinate complex cellular responses

In response to physiological stimuli, some transcription factors regulate the expression of several genes (see Table 4-3). As an example, we discuss how oxygen concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]\right)$ controls gene expression.

## BOX 4-2 Role of a Chimeric Transcription Factor in Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia

Correct regulation of gene expression involves both transcription factors and the DNA regulatory elements to which they bind. Abnormalities of either can and do result in abnormal regulation of gene expression, which is often manifested as disease. An example of a transcription factor abnormality is acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a hematological malignant state in which cells of the granulocyte lineage (promyelocytes) fail to differentiate. Normally, retinoic acid (RA) binds to retinoic acid receptor- $\alpha$ (RAR $\alpha$ ), a member of the steroid and thyroid hormone receptor superfamily. RAR $\alpha$ forms heterodimers with retinoid $X$ receptor (RXR) and binds to retinoic acid response elements (RAREs) that are present in genes involved in cell differentiation. In the absence of RA, RAR $\alpha /$ RXR heterodimers bind to RAREs and recruit the corepressor N-CoR, which in turn recruits HDACs that inhibit gene transcription. Binding of RA to RAR $\alpha$ leads to dissociation of N-CoR, which permits binding of the coactivator CBP (see p. 89) and activation of RAR $\alpha$-responsive genes that promote cell differentiation. Ninety percent of patients with APL have a translocation affecting chromosomes 15 and 17, t(15;17), that produces a chimeric transcription factor containing the DNA- and hormone-binding domains of RAR $\alpha$, fused to the promyelocytic leukemia protein (PML). The PML/RAR $\alpha$ chimeric protein also binds to RA and forms heterodimers with RXR but has an abnormally high affinity for N-CoR. At physiological levels of RA, N-CoR remains bound to PML/RAR $\alpha$, blocking promyelocytic differentiation. However, high concentrations of RA induce dissociation of N-CoR and permit differentiation. This mechanism explains why high concentrations of exogenous RA can be used to induce clinical remissions in patients with APL.

When chronically exposed to low $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$ (hypoxia), many cells undergo dramatic changes in gene expression. For example, cells switch from oxidative metabolism to glycolysis, which requires the induction of genes encoding glycolytic enzymes. Many tissues activate the gene encoding the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which stimulates angiogenesis (see p. 481) and improves the blood supply to chronically hypoxic tissues. The kidney activates the gene encoding erythropoietin (see pp. 431-433), a hormone that stimulates red cell production in the bone marrow. These changes in gene expression promote survival of the cell or organism in a hypoxic environment. A key mediator in the response to hypoxia is a transcription factor called hypoxiainducible factor $1 \alpha$ (HIF-1 $\alpha$ ).

HIF-1 $\alpha$ (Fig. 4-16A) belongs to the bHLH family of transcription factors (see p. 83). In addition, it contains a PAS domain $\bigcirc$ N4-7 that mediates dimerization. HIF-1 $\alpha$ binds to DNA as a heterodimer with HIF-1 $\beta$. HIF-1 $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is expressed at constant levels in cells, but the abundance of HIF-1 $\alpha$ changes markedly in response to changes in $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$. At a normal $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$ (normoxia), HIF-1 $\alpha$ levels are low. Under hypoxic conditions, the abundance of HIF-1 $\alpha$ increases. HIF-1 $\alpha$ together with HIF-1 $\beta$ binds to an enhancer, called a hypoxia response element, that is present in many genes activated during hypoxia, including genes encoding glycolytic enzymes, VEGF, and erythropoietin.

Figure 4-16 Regulation of HIF-1 $\alpha$ by oxygen. A, In the presence of oxygen, HIF-1 $\alpha$ is hydroxylated on proline and asparagine by hydroxylases. B, Hydroxylation of HIF-1 $\alpha$ promotes its degradation and inhibits its interaction with coactivators. C, In hypoxic conditions, dehydroxylation of HIF-1 $\alpha$ promotes its stabilization and transcriptional activity.

The cell regulates the abundance of HIF-1 $\alpha$ by hydroxylation-a post-translational modification-at specific proline and asparagine residues. Oxygen activates the prolyl and asparaginyl hydroxylases (see Fig. 4-16A). Proline hydroxylation stimulates the interaction of HIF-1 $\alpha$ with VHL, a protein that targets HIF-1 $\alpha$ for proteasomal degradation (see Fig. 4-16B). Asparagine hydroxylation inhibits the interaction of HIF-1 $\alpha$ with the transcriptional coactivator CBP. Because both of these hydroxylations reduce transcriptional activity, normoxic conditions lower the expression of HIF-1 $\alpha$ target genes.

In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, the hydroxylases are inactive, and HIF-1 $\alpha$ is not hydroxylated on proline and asparagine residues. HIF-1 $\alpha$ accumulates in the nucleus and interacts with CBP, which activates the transcription of

downstream target genes, including VEGF and erythropoietin (see Fig. 4-16C). The net result is a system in which the expression of multiple hypoxia-inducible genes is coordinately and tightly regulated through post-translational modification of a common transcriptional activator.

## EPIGENETIC REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION

Although genetic information can flow from parent to child, or from parental cells to progeny cells, via the sequence of nucleotides in DNA, it can also flow via mechanisms that are independent of DNA sequence and yet stably inherited. This form of inheritance is referred to as epigenetic regulation of gene expression. We have already introduced one form of epigenetic gene regulation, which is the separation of chromatin into transcriptionally active euchromatin and transcriptionally inactive heterochromatin (see p. 76). Although shifting between euchromatin and heterochromatin does not change the DNA sequence, the progeny cells maintain this distinction. Thus, the formation of heterochromatin and euchromatin is an example of epigenetic gene regulation.

## Epigenetic regulation can result in long-term gene silencing

Epigenetic regulation can have a long-term influence on gene expression. The following are three examples of long-term regulation of gene expression:

1. X-inactivation. Females carry two X chromosomes (see p. 1074), whereas males carry only one copy. To express X-linked genes at the same levels as males, females during development permanently inactivate one of the X chromosomes by globally converting one X chromosome from euchromatin to heterochromatin.
2. Imprinting. Cells contain two copies of every autosomal gene, one inherited from each parent, and usually express each copy identically. In a few cases, however, genes are differentially expressed, depending on whether they are inherited from the mother or the father. This phenomenon is called genomic imprinting. (1) 88-12 For example, the insulin-like growth factor 2 gene (IGF2; see pp. 996-997) is maternally imprinted-only the copy inherited from the father is expressed; the maternal copy is silenced (i.e., not expressed).
3. Tissue-specific gene silencing. Many tissue-specific genes are globally inactivated during embryonic development, later to be reactivated only in particular tissues. For example, globin genes are silenced except in erythroid cells. The silencing of genes in nonexpressing tissues is associated with chromatin modifications that are similar to those found in heterochromatin.

X-inactivation, imprinting, and tissue-specific silencing require long-term inactivation of gene expression and the maintenance of this inactivation during DNA replication and cell division. For example, the inactivated X chromosome remains inactivated in the two progeny cells after mitosis. Similarly, genes silenced by imprinting or by tissuespecific silencing remain inactive in progeny cells.

## Alterations in chromatin structure may mediate epigenetic regulation, stimulating or inhibiting gene transcription

DNA in the nucleus is organized into a higher-order structure called chromatin, which consists of DNA and associated histones (see p. 75-76). The building block of chromatin, the nucleosome, is composed of DNA wrapped twice around core histones to form a solenoid-like structure (see Fig. 4-3). Nucleosomes present a physical barrier to gene transcription by blocking access of transcription factors to their binding sites in DNA and by interfering with elongation of nascent RNA transcripts. In general, a high density of tightly packed nucleosomes, or a nucleosome positioned at the transcription start site, is associated with gene inactivation. Conversely, repositioning or removal of nucleosomes, creating a nucleosome-free region at the promoter, can lead to gene activation. ATP-dependent chromatin-remodeling enzymes-belonging to the SWI/SNF, ISWI, IO80, and CHD families-can alter the density and location of nucleosomes. Because chromatin remodeling does not change the underlying DNA sequence, it represents a form of epigenetic gene regulation.

Covalent modifications of histones or DNA can also produce alterations in chromatin structure that mediate epigenetic gene regulation. These chemical modifications are sometimes referred to as epigenetic marks. We have already introduced one type of epigenetic mark, histone acetylation (see p. 84). The N termini of core histone proteins contain many lysine residues that impart a highly positive charge. These positively charged domains can bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA via electrostatic interactions (Fig. 4-17). Tight binding between DNA and histones is associated with gene inactivity. However, if the $\varepsilon$-amino groups of lysine side chains are chemically modified by acetylation, the positive charge is neutralized and the interaction with DNA is relaxed, which facilitates the binding of transcription factors and the basal transcriptional machinery. We have already seen that many transcriptional coactivators have intrinsic histone acetylase activity, whereas transcriptional corepressors may function as histone deacetylases (see pp. 85-86). In general, euchromatin is characterized by high levels of histone acetylation, whereas heterochromatin is characterized by low levels of acetylation.

## Histone methylation may stimulate or inhibit gene expression

In addition to acetylation, histones are subject to other posttranslational modifications that influence epigenetic gene regulation. Especially important is methylation, in which a methyltransferase covalently attaches methyl groups to arginine residues and, most significantly, to specific lysine residues in the core histones. Histone methylation is associated with gene activation or repression, depending on the specific amino-acid residue that is modified. Methylation of histone H3 at Lys-4, Lys-36, and Lys-79 on histone H3 correlates with transcriptionally active chromatin. Demethylation of these H3 residues-but methylation of Lys-9 and Lys-27 on histone H3-correlates with transcriptionally inactive chromatin (i.e., repression). This pattern of differential

# N4-13 Genomic Imprinting 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep, Walter Boron, and Sam Mesiano

Genomic imprinting is the process by which certain genesabout $1 \%$ of the genome-are silenced; particular genes are silenced only in female gametes, and others, only in male gametes. Thus, these genes are expressed in a manner specific to the parent of origin.

Note that a female diploid oogonium has some paternal genes imprinted or silenced (i.e., only the maternal gene is active) and some maternal genes silenced (i.e., only the paternal gene is active). When the 2 N genome splits into two 1 N genomes, it is important that all genes in the oocyte have the female pattern of imprinting, which occurs during oocyte maturation.

Failure of proper genomic imprinting causes aberrant gene expression and is associated with several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann, Prader-Willi, and Angelman syndromes. For example, the IGF2 gene is normally mater-nally imprinted (i.e., silenced). In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the maternal IGF2 gene becomes reactivated (by removal of methyl tags) during oocyte formation in the mother or early embryonic development. The result is that the offspring has two (rather than one) active copies of IGF2 and thus excess IGF-2 protein. The most obvious sign is macrosomia (large body size) in the newborn.

Figure 4-17 Effect of histone acetylation on the interaction between histone proteins and DNA. When the histone octamer is deacetylated (top), positively charged lysine groups on the histone strongly attract a strand of DNA. When the histone octamer becomes acetylated (bottom), the acetyl groups neutralize the positive charge on the histone and allow the DNA strand to loosen.
methylation in transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin is referred to as a histone code, inasmuch as it can be inherited just as the genetic code in DNA.

Methylation of histones affects gene expression by recruiting proteins that alter chromatin structure. For example, trimethylation of Lys-4 on histone H 3 , which is often found at active gene promoters, is specifically recognized by a subunit of the nucleosome-remodeling factor (NURF) chromatin-remodeling complex. Recruitment of the NURF complex results in the displacement of nucleosomes in the region and promotes gene transcription. Conversely, trimethylation of histone H3 at Lys-9 (H3-K9) is found in heterochromatin and is also characteristic of gene silencing by X-inactivation, imprinting, and tissue-specific silencing. Trimethylated H3-K9 recruits heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1), which then self-dimerizes to produce higher-order structures (Fig. 4-18A). In addition, HP1 recruits HDAC (see pp. 85-86), which promotes nucleosome assembly. Together, these modifications produce a closed chromatin conformation. Cells maintain this H3-K9 methylation during division, possibly by using the HP1. After it binds to methylated histones, HP1 recruits a histone methyltransferase (HMT) that methylates other K9 residues on other H3 histones (see Fig. 4-18B); this provides a mechanism for propagation of histone methylation. During DNA replication, the HMT recruited to a silenced gene on a parental strand of chromatin adds methyl groups to histones on the daughter strands, which maintains gene silencing in the progeny.

## DNA methylation is associated with gene inactivation

Methylation of cytosine residues at its 5 position is the only well-documented postsynthetic modification of DNA in higher eukaryotes. Approximately 5\% of cytosine residues are 5-methylcytosines in mammalian DNA. Methylation usually occurs on a cytosine residue that is immediately upstream from a guanosine (i.e., a CpG dinucleotide on one DNA strand).

Several lines of evidence implicate DNA methylation in the control of gene expression.

1. Although CpG dinucleotides are relatively underrepresented in mammalian genomes, they are frequently clustered near the $5^{\prime}$ ends of genes, forming so-called $\mathbf{C p G}$ islands. Moreover, methylation of cytosines in these locations is associated with inhibition of gene expression. For example, the inactivated X chromosome in females contains heavily methylated genes.
2. Methylation/demethylation may explain tissue-specific and stage-dependent gene expression. For example, globin genes are methylated in nonexpressing tissues but hypomethylated in erythroid cells. During fetal

4. Chemical demethylating agents, such as 5 -azacytidine, can activate previously inactive genes.

How does DNA methylation cause gene inactivation? One simple mechanism is that methylation inhibits the binding of an essential transcriptional activator. For example, methylation of CpG dinucleotides within the GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) promoter prevents STAT3 binding. A more common mechanism is that methylation produces
binding sites for proteins that promote gene inactivation. Cells contain a protein called MeCP2 that binds specifically to methylated CpG dinucleotides as well as to the HDAC (see pp. 85-86). Thus, DNA methylation may silence genes by promoting histone deacetylation. In addition, methylated DNA binds to methyl-CpG-binding protein 1 (MBD1), a protein that complexes with HMT (see Fig. 4-18C). These last two interactions provide mechanisms coupling DNA methylation to histone modifications that promote heterochromatin formation and gene silencing.

The cell maintains patterns of DNA methylation during division. To illustrate, imagine that the DNA at a particular locus is initially methylated on both strands. After replication, the two double strands of daughter DNA are each methylated on only one of the two strands. This hemimethylated DNA recruits proteins that in turn recruit DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) to copy the methylation pattern onto the newly synthesized DNA strand. This mechanism ensures that epigenetic marks in a parent cell are maintained in the progeny cells.

## POST-TRANSLATIONAL REGULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION

Although initiation of transcription (see Fig. 4-4, step 2) is the most frequently regulated step in gene expression, for certain genes subsequent steps are more important for determining the overall level of expression. These processes are generally classified as post-transcriptional regulation. The mechanisms for regulating these steps are less well understood than are those for regulating transcription initiation, but some information comes from the study of model genes. Post-transcriptional processes that we review here are premRNA splicing (step 5) and transcript degradation (step 8).

## Alternative splicing generates diversity from single genes

Eukaryotic genes contain introns (see p. 74) that must be removed from the primary transcript to create mature mRNA; this process is called pre-mRNA splicing. Splicing involves the joining of two sites on the RNA transcript, the $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor site and the $3^{\prime}$ splice-acceptor site, and removal of the intervening intron. The first step involves cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor site. Second, joining of the $5^{\prime}$ end of the intron to an adenosine residue located within the intron forms a "lariat" structure. Third, ligation of the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ splice sites releases the lariat intron. The splicing reaction occurs in the nucleus, mediated by ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs) that are composed of proteins and small nuclear RNA (snRNA). Together, the assembly of pre-mRNA and snRNPs forms a large complex called the spliceosome. (1) N4-14

Many genes undergo alternative splicing, which refers to differential splicing of the same primary transcript to produce mature transcripts that contain different combinations of exons. If the coding region is affected, the resulting splicing variants will encode proteins with distinct primary structures that may have different physiological functions. Thus, alternative splicing is a mechanism for increasing the

The location of the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ splice sites is based, at least in part, on the sequences at the ends of the introns. The $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor site has the consensus sequence $5^{\prime}-(\mathrm{C} / \mathrm{A}) \mathrm{AG} \downarrow \mathrm{G} \mathrm{U}(\mathrm{G}) / \mathrm{A}) \mathrm{AGU}-3^{\prime}$; the vertical arrow represents the boundary between the exon and the intron. The $3^{\prime}$ splice-acceptor site has the consensus sequence $5^{\prime}$ Y $_{\mathrm{n}}$ NCAG $\downarrow \mathrm{G}-3^{\prime} ; \mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{n}}$ represents a polypyrimidine tract (i.e., a long sequence of only C and U ), and N represents any nucleotide. An intronic site located $>17$ nucleotides upstream from the $3^{\prime}$ acceptor site ( $5^{\prime}$-YNCUG-4C-3'), called the branch point, is also present and contains the adenosine (red background in eFig 4-7) that contributes to formation of the lariat structure.

eFigure 4-7 Mechanism of pre-mRNA splicing. This example illustrates how a $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor site at one end of exon 1 can link to the $3^{\prime}$ spliceacceptor site at the end of exon 2 and thereby splice out the intervening intron. The process can be divided into three steps: (1) cleavage of the pre-mRNA at the $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor site; (2) joining of the $5^{\prime}$ end of the intron to an adenosine residue that is located within the intron, forming a lariat structure; and (3) ligation of the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ splice sites and release of the lariat intron.

diversity of proteins that a single gene can produce. Figure 4-19 summarizes seven patterns of alternative splicing.

Retained Intron In some cases, the cell may choose whether to splice out a segment of RNA. For example, the $\gamma \mathrm{A}$ isoform of rat $\gamma$-fibrinogen lacks the seventh intron, whereas the $\gamma \beta$ isoform retains the intron, which encodes a unique C terminus of 12 amino acids (see Fig. 4-19A).

Alternative 3' Splice Sites In this case, the length of an intron is variable because the downstream boundary of the intron can be at either of two or more different $3^{\prime}$ spliceacceptor sites (see Fig. 4-19B). For example, in rat fibronectin, a single donor site may be spliced to any of three acceptor sites. The presence or absence of the amino acids encoded by the sequence between the different splice-acceptor sites results in fibronectin isoforms with different cell adhesion properties.

Alternative 5' Splice Sites Here also, the length of the intron is variable. However, in this case, it is the upstream
boundary of the intron that can be at either of two or more different $5^{\prime}$ splice-donor sites (see Fig. 4-19C). For example, cells can generate mRNA encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (see p. 968) with different $5^{\prime}$ UTRs by splicing from multiple donor sites for the first intron to a single acceptor site.

Cassette Exons In some cases, the cell may choose either to splice in an exon or group of exons (cassette exons) or not to splice them in (see Fig. 4-19D). An example is the $\alpha$-tropomyosin gene, which contains 12 exons. All $\alpha$-tropomyosin transcripts contain the invariant exons 1,4 to 6,8 , and 9 . All muscle-like cells splice in exon 7 , but hepatoma (i.e., liver tumor) cells do not splice in exon 7; they directly link exon 6 to exon 8.

Mutually Exclusive Exons In yet other cases, the cell may splice in mutually exclusive exons (see Fig. 4-19E). One of the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter genes ( $N K C C 2$ ) is an example. Isoforms containing distinct 96-bp exons are differentially expressed in the kidney cortex and medulla. Because the

encoded amino-acid sequence is predicted to reside in the membrane, the isoforms may have different kinetic properties. The $\alpha$-tropomyosin gene again is another example. Smooth-muscle cells splice in exon 2 but not exon 3. Striatedmuscle cells and myoblasts splice in exon 3 but not exon 2. Fibroblasts and hepatoma cells do not splice in either of these two exons.

Alternative 5' Ends Cells may select among different alternative promoters, creating alternative $5^{\prime}$ ends, and then splice the selected end to a downstream portion of the premRNA (see Fig. 4-19F). For example, the SLC4A4 gene that encodes the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter 1 (see p. 122) has 26 exons. The transcript that encodes the NBCe1-A variant expressed heavily in the renal proximal tubule (see p. 829) initiates from a promoter located upstream from exon 4 and then continues with exons 5 through 26. The transcript that encodes the NBCe1-B variant expressed heavily in pancreatic ducts (see pp. 885-886) initiates from a promoter located upstream from exon 1 and then continues with exons 2 through 26. This use of alternative promoters permits differential regulation of gene expression in kidney versus pancreas. The genes encoding myosin light chain (see p. 233-234) and $\alpha$-amylase (see p. 916) are additional examples. (5) N4-15

Alternative 3' Ends Finally, cells may differentially splice the transcript near the $3^{\prime}$ end of the gene (see Fig. 4-19G) and thereby alter the site of cleavage and polyadenylation. Such splicing may also affect the coding region. Again, $\alpha$-tropomyosin is an example. Striated-muscle cells splice in exon 11, which contains one alternative $3^{\prime}$ UTR. Smoothmuscle cells splice in exon 12 instead of exon 11. Another example is the calcitonin gene, which encodes both the hormone calcitonin (see pp. 1067-1068) and calcitonin gene-related peptide- $\alpha$ (CGRP $\alpha$ ). Thyroid C cells produce one splice variant that includes exons 1 to 4 and encodes calcitonin. Sensory neurons, on the other hand, produce another splice variant that excludes exon 4 but includes exons 5 and 6. It encodes a different protein, CGRP $\alpha$.

These examples illustrate that some splicing variants are expressed only in certain cell types and not in others. Clearly, control of alternative splicing must involve steps other than initiation of transcription because many splice variants have identical $5^{\prime}$ ends. In some genes, the control elements that are required for alternative splicing have been identified, largely on the basis of deletion mutations that result in aberrant splicing. These control elements can reside in either introns or exons and are located within or near the splice sites. The proteins that interact with such elements remain largely unknown, although some RNA-binding proteins that may be involved in regulation of splicing have been identified.

## Regulatory elements in the $3^{\prime}$ untranslated region control mRNA stability

Degradation of mRNA is mediated by enzymes called ribonucleases. These enzymes include $3^{\prime}-5^{\prime}$ exonucleases, which digest RNA from the $3^{\prime}$ end; $5^{\prime}-3^{\prime}$ exonucleases, which digest from the $5^{\prime}$ end; and endonucleases, which digest at internal sites. The stability of mRNA in cytoplasm varies widely for different transcripts. Transcripts that encode cytokines and immediate-early genes are frequently short-lived, with halflives measured in minutes. Other transcripts are much more stable, with half-lives that exceed 24 hours. Moreover, cells can modulate the stability of individual transcripts and thus use this mechanism to affect the overall level of expression of the gene. (5) N4-16

Regulatory elements that stabilize mRNA, as well as elements that accelerate its degradation, are frequently located in the $3^{\prime}$ UTR of the transcripts. A well-characterized example of a gene that is primarily regulated by transcript stability is the transferrin receptor (Fig. 4-20). The transferrin receptor is required for uptake of iron into most of the cells of the body (see p. 42). During states of iron deprivation, transferrin receptor mRNA levels increase, whereas transcript levels decrease when iron is plentiful. Regulation of expression of the gene encoding the transferrin receptor is primarily post-transcriptional: changes in the half-life (i.e.,

## N4-15 Myosin Light Chain Alternative Splicing

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

In the case of the myosin light chain (MLC) gene (see pp. 233-234), which consists of nine exons, one transcript is initiated from a promoter that is located upstream from exon 1, skips exons 2 and 3, and includes exons 4 to 9 . The other transcript is initiated instead at a promoter located in the first intron and consists of exons 2,3 , and 5 to 9 . Because the coding region is affected, the two transcripts encode proteins that differ at their N -terminal ends. These splice variants are found in different cells or different developmental stages.

## N4-16 Degradation of mRNA by Ribonucleases

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

A structural feature of typical mRNA that contributes to its stability in cytoplasm is the $5^{\prime}$ methyl cap, in which the presence of the $5^{\prime}-5^{\prime}$ phosphodiester bond makes it resistant to digestion by $5^{\prime}-3^{\prime}$ exonucleases. Similarly, the poly(A) tail at the $3^{\prime}$ end of the transcript often protects messages from degradation. Deadenylation (i.e., removal of the tail) is often a prerequisite for mRNA degradation. Accordingly, transcripts with long poly(A) tails may be more stable in cytoplasm than are transcripts with short poly(A) tails.

stability) of the message lead to alterations in the level of the mRNA.

Regulation of transferrin receptor mRNA stability depends on elements that are located in the $3^{\prime}$ UTR called iron response elements (IREs). An IRE is a stem-loop structure that is created by intramolecular formation of hydrogen bonds. The human transferrin receptor transcript contains five IREs in the $3^{\prime}$ UTR. The IRE binds a cellular protein called IRE-binding protein (IRE-BP), which stabilizes transferrin receptor mRNA in the cytoplasm. When IRE-BP dissociates, the transcript is rapidly degraded. IRE-BP can also bind to iron, and the presence of iron decreases its affinity for the IRE. During states of iron deficiency, less iron binds to IRE-BP, and thus more IRE-BP binds to the IRE on the mRNA. The increased stability of the transcript allows the cell to produce more transferrin receptors. Conversely, when iron is plentiful and binds to IRE-BP, IRE-BP dissociates from the IRE, and the transferrin receptor transcript is rapidly degraded. This design prevents cellular iron overload.

## MicroRNAs regulate mRNA abundance and translation

A major form of post-transcriptional gene regulation occurs via small RNA molecules called microRNAs (miRNAs), which mediate a type of post-transcriptional gene regulation. miRNAs are typically $\sim 22$ nucleotides in length, too short to encode proteins. Instead, miRNAs play regulatory functions in many physiological and pathophysiological processes. They bind to specific mRNA targets and regulate mRNA abundance and translation. Because this regulation occurs after the transcription of mRNA, it is post-transcriptional in nature.

Figure 4-21 shows the biogenesis and function of miRNAs. Transcription of genomic DNA initially gives rise to a longer primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) transcript, which the endonuclease Drosha then cleaves to produce a precursor miRNA (pre-miRNA), typically 50 to 70 nucleotides in length. The pre-miRNA forms a hairpin structure because of intramolecular base pairing. The pre-miRNA, complexed with exportin-5 and Ran-GTP, then exits the nucleus via nuclear pores. In the cytoplasm, a second endonuclease called Dicer cleaves the pre-miRNA to produce the mature, singlestranded miRNA.

In the cytoplasm, the newly synthesized miRNA associates with a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). Once complexed with RISC, the miRNA binds via base pairing to an mRNA target. Usually, miRNAs bind to sites located in the $3^{\prime}$ UTR of mRNA, although occasionally it binds to sites in the $5^{\prime}$ UTR (see Fig. 4-2). Recall that the $5^{\prime}$ and $3^{\prime}$ UTRs flank the coding region of the mRNA. Binding of the miRNA and the associated RISC complex results in degradation of the mRNA target or inhibits translation of the mRNA. In some cases, the targeted mRNA may be sequestered in subcellular organelles, called processing bodies ( $\mathbf{P}$ bodies), where it is no longer available for translation. Regardless of the exact mechanism, the net result is that the expression of the protein encoded by the mRNA is inhibited. (○) N4-17

The inhibition of gene expression by miRNAs represents a form of RNA interference. RNA interference refers to a process, found in most animal and plant species, in which short RNA molecules silence the expression of specific genes.

# N4-17 Small Interfering RNA 

## Contributed by Peter Igarashi

Small interfering RNAs (siRNA) may modulate gene expression both at the post-transcriptional level and at the level of chromatin structure. These siRNAs are short ( $\sim 22 \mathrm{bp}$ ), double-stranded RNA molecules, one strand of which is complementary in sequence to a target mRNA. The process in which siRNAs silence the expression of specific genes is called RNA interference (RNAi).

Recall that RNA is usually single stranded. However, certain non-protein-coding sequences in the genome may yield RNA transcripts that contain inverted repeats, which allows doublestranded hairpins to form via intramolecular hydrogen bonds (eFig. 4-8). Cleavage of the hairpin structure by an endonuclease called Dicer produces the mature siRNA.

Mature siRNA can assemble into a ribonucleoprotein complex called RISC, which specifically cleaves a target mRNA that is
complementary in sequence to one of the strands of the siRNA (see eFig. 4-8). In addition, the binding of an siRNA to a complementary mRNA can inhibit translation of the mRNA into protein (see eFig. 4-8). Finally, siRNAs can assemble into another ribonucleoprotein complex called RNA-induced transcriptional silencing (RITS) complex, which promotes DNA and histone methylation and thus the formation of heterochromatin (see eFig. 4-8).

Hundreds of genes that are potentially regulated by RNAi have been identified, and it is likely that this number will continue to grow. Because the expression of siRNAs is often tissue specific and developmentally regulated, RNAi may be an important mechanism for silencing gene expression during cell differentiation.

The siRNA is produced from hairpin RNA by Dicer. 1, Assembly of siRNA in the RISC results in cleavage of the target mRNA. 2, The siRNA can also inhibit mRNA translation. 3, Assembly of siRNA in the RITS complex promotes DNA methylation and gene silencing.

Andrew Fire and Craig Mello-who shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (1) N4-18-discovered RNA interference in 1998 in the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans.

Since the discovery of the first mammalian miRNA in 2000, hundreds of miRNAs have been identified in humans and other species. The sequences of miRNAs are often evolutionarily conserved, consistent with their important functions. The binding of a particular miRNA to its mRNA targets is primarily dependent on a short seven-nucleotide sequence, the seed sequence, at the $5^{\prime}$ end of the miRNA. Different miRNAs contain different seed sequences and thereby recognize and inhibit distinct mRNA targets. Because the seed sequence is relatively short, an individual miRNA can bind many, perhaps hundreds, of different mRNA targets. miRNAs are thought to fine-tune gene expression, and the magnitude of their effects on individual mRNAs is relatively modest, typically less than 2-fold. However, the cumulative effect produced by targeting multiple mRNA targets in the same pathway may produce physiologically significant effects. miRNAs regulate hundreds of genes and, according to some estimates, may regulate more than one third of human genes.
miRNAs play important roles in embryonic development, stem-cell differentiation, cell proliferation, and cell death. Other physiological processes under the control of miRNAs include insulin secretion, the stress response, renin secretion, and lipid metabolism. By fine-tuning mRNA abundance and translation, miRNAs work in concert with gene transcription to maintain the levels of proteins in cells within an optimal range. Dysregulation of miRNAs commonly plays a role in pathological conditions such as cancer, viral infection, diabetes, and Alzheimer disease.

## BOX 4-3 Roles of miRNAs in Cardiac Stress Responses

Elevated blood pressure imposes stress on the heart that, if sustained, results in pathological remodeling, leading to cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, heart failure, and increased arrhythmias. miRNAs play an important role in the cardiac response to stress, in which cardiac myocytes switch their expression of myosin heavy chains from the normally dominant adult $\alpha \mathrm{MHC}$ to $\beta \mathrm{MHC}$, which is normally weakly expressed (see Table 9-1). Embedded in one of the introns of the $\alpha \mathrm{MHC}$ gene is the miRNA called miR-208. Therefore, expression of $\alpha \mathrm{MHC}$ results in coexpression of miR-208, which targets a transcriptional corepressor called thyroid hormone receptor-associated protein 1 (THRAP1). Normally, THRAP1 interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor (see pp. 1010-1011) to inhibit transcription of the MYH7 gene, which encodes $\beta \mathrm{MHC}$. Thus, by reducing THRAP1 expression, miR-208 disinhibits $\beta \mathrm{MHC}$ transcription. Indeed, miR-208 is necessary for expression of the $\beta \mathrm{MHC}$ and cardiac remodeling. Mice lacking miR-208 cannot upregulate $\beta \mathrm{MHC}$ and are protected from pathological remodeling in response to cardiac stress.

Pathological cardiac remodeling also results in increased cardiac fibrosis. The miRNA miR-29 inhibits the expression of collagen and other components of the extracellular matrix. Cardiac stress inhibits miR-29 expression, which results in increased production of extracellular matrix and fibrosis.

Peter S. Aronson, Walter F. Boron, and Emile L. Boulpaep

The cells of the human body live in a carefully regulated fluid environment. The fluid inside the cells, the intracellular fluid (ICF), occupies what is called the intracellular compartment, and the fluid outside the cells, the extracellular fluid (ECF), occupies the extracellular compartment. The barriers that separate these two compartments are the cell membranes. For life to be sustained, the body must rigorously maintain the volume and composition of the intracellular and extracellular compartments. To a large extent, such regulation is the result of transport across the cell membrane. In this chapter, we discuss how cell membranes regulate the distribution of ions and water in the intracellular and extracellular compartments.

## THE INTRACELLULAR AND EXTRACELLULAR FLUIDS

## Total-body water is the sum of the ICF and ECF volumes

Total-body water (TBW) (1) N5-1 is $\sim 60 \%$ of total-body weight in a young adult human male, $\sim 50 \%$ of total-body weight in a young adult human female (Table 5-1), and $65 \%$ to $75 \%$ of total-body weight in an infant. TBW accounts for a lower percentage of weight in females because they typically have a higher ratio of adipose tissue to muscle, and fat cells have a lower water content than does muscle. Even if gender and age are taken into consideration, the fraction of total-body weight contributed by water is not constant for all individuals under all conditions. For example, variability in the amount of adipose tissue can influence the fraction. Because water represents such a large fraction of body weight, acute changes in TBW can be detected simply by monitoring body weight.

The anatomy of the body fluid compartments is illustrated in Figure 5-1. The prototypical $70-\mathrm{kg}$ male has $\sim 42 \mathrm{~L}$ of TBW ( $60 \%$ of 70 kg ). Of these $42 \mathrm{~L}, \sim 60 \%$ ( 25 L ) is intracellular and $\sim 40 \%$ ( 17 L ) is extracellular. ECF is composed of blood plasma, interstitial fluid, and transcellular fluid.

Plasma Volume Of the $\sim 17 \mathrm{~L}$ of ECF, only $\sim 20 \%(\sim 3 \mathrm{~L})$ is contained within the cardiac chambers and blood vessels, that is, within the intravascular compartment. The total volume of this intravascular compartment is the blood volume, $\sim 6 \mathrm{~L}$. The extracellular 3 L of the blood volume is the plasma volume. The balance, $\sim 3 \mathrm{~L}$, consists of the cellular elements of blood: erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. The fraction of blood volume that is occupied by these cells is called the hematocrit. The hematocrit is determined by centrifuging blood that is treated with an anticoagulant and measuring the fraction of the total volume that is occupied by the packed cells.

Interstitial Fluid About $75 \%$ ( 13 L ) of the ECF is outside the intravascular compartment, where it bathes the nonblood cells of the body. Within this interstitial fluid are two smaller compartments that communicate only slowly with the bulk of the interstitial fluid: dense connective tissue, such as cartilage and tendons, and bone matrix.

The barriers that separate the intravascular and interstitial compartments are the walls of capillaries. Water and solutes can move between the interstitium and blood plasma by crossing capillary walls and between the interstitium and cytoplasm by crossing cell membranes.

Transcellular Fluid Finally, $\sim 5 \%$ ( 1 L ) of ECF is trapped within spaces that are completely surrounded by epithelial cells. This transcellular fluid includes the synovial fluid within joints and the cerebrospinal fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Transcellular fluid does not include fluids that are, strictly speaking, outside the body, such as the contents of the gastrointestinal tract or urinary bladder.

## ICF is rich in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, whereas ECF is rich in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$

Not only do the various body fluid compartments have very different volumes, they also have radically different compositions, as summarized in Figure 5-1. Table 5-2 is a more comprehensive listing of these values. ICF is high in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and low in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-} ; \mathrm{ECF}$ (interstitial and plasma) are high in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and low in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The cell maintains a relatively high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration ( $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ ) and low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}\right)$, not by making its membrane totally impermeable to these ions but by using the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump to extrude $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$actively from the cell and to transport $\mathrm{K}^{+}$actively into the cell.

Transcellular fluids differ greatly in composition, both from each other and from plasma, because they are secreted

# N5-1 Determination of the Volume of Body Fluid Compartments 

## Contributed by Peter Aronson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

The TBW can be determined by the use of a volume-of-distribution technique. The first step is to infuse intravenously a known quantity of a tracer for water (deuterium oxide $\left[{ }^{3} \mathrm{HOH}\right.$ ) or tritiated water $\left[{ }^{3} \mathrm{HOH}\right.$ ) that will distribute everywhere there is water. Because water readily permeates most cell membranes, a tracer for water distributes into both the extracellular and ICF.

For example, suppose a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ male is injected with $10^{8}$ counts per minute (cpm) of ${ }^{3} \mathrm{HOH}$ contained in a small volume of physiological saline. After an equilibration period of 2 hours, a sample of the blood plasma is drawn and the ${ }^{3} \mathrm{HOH}$ concentration in the plasma is found to be $2.5 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{cpm} / \mathrm{mL}$ plasma. Measurement also reveals that $5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{cpm}$ of ${ }^{3} \mathrm{HOH}$ has been lost in urine, as well as from the skin and lungs. From this information, we can calculate the volume of distribution of the tracer, which is the same as the TBW:

TBW $=$ Volume of distribution

$$
=\frac{(\text { Quantity infused) }-(\text { Quantity excreted })}{(\text { Concentration in the plasma) }} \quad(\text { NE 5-1) }
$$

$$
=\frac{\left(10^{9} \mathrm{cpm}\right)-\left(5 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{cpm}\right)}{\left(2.5 \times 10^{3} \mathrm{cpm} / \mathrm{mL}\right)}=39.8 \mathrm{~L}
$$

In this male, the TBW of 39.8 L is $57 \%$ of the $70-\mathrm{kg}$ body weight.

How can we determine how this water is distributed among the various fluid compartments? In particular, we need to know the fraction of the TBW that is intracellular and the fraction that is extracellular. In practice, the ICF volume is calculated as the difference between TBW and ECF volume. The ECF volume is determined by using a marker that distributes uniformly throughout the compartments accessible to water but that does not enter the cells. Unfortunately, different markers thought to distribute within the ECF yield different values. For example, large polysaccharides (e.g., inulin) or polyalcohols (e.g., mannitol) that cannot cross cell membranes do not penetrate fully into dense connective tissue and bone. On the other hand, ions that are largely extracellular (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) are able to enter cells to some extent. Using the above techniques, the best estimate is that the total ECF represents between $20 \%$ and $25 \%$ of body weight ( $\sim 40 \%$ of TBW). This leaves about $35 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the body weight ( $\sim 60 \%$ of TBW) as intracellular water or ICF volume.

The plasma volume can be determined by measuring the volume of distribution of labeled albumin. Because albumin escapes only very slowly from the vascular compartment, measuring the final concentration of labeled albumin in the plasma and then using the above equation to compute the volume of distribution of the albumin label will yield the plasma volume.

TBW is divided into four major compartments: ICF (green), interstitial fluid (blue), blood plasma (red), and transcellular water such as synovial fluid (tan).

by different epithelia. The two major constituents of ECF, the plasma and the interstitial fluid, have similar composition as far as small solutes are concerned. For most cells, it is the composition of the interstitial fluid enveloping the cells that is the relevant parameter. The major difference between plasma and interstitial fluid is the absence of plasma proteins from the interstitium. These plasma proteins, which cannot equilibrate across the walls of most capillaries, are responsible for the usually slight difference in small-solute concentrations between plasma and interstitial fluid. Plasma
proteins affect solute distribution because of the volume they occupy and the electrical charge they carry.

Volume Occupied by Plasma Proteins The proteins and, to a much lesser extent, the lipids in plasma ordinarily occupy $\sim 7 \%$ of the total plasma volume. Clinical laboratories report the plasma composition of ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$) in units of milliequivalents (meq) per liter of plasma solution. However, for cells bathed by interstitial fluid, a more meaningful unit would be milliequivalents per liter of protein-free plasma

solution because it is only the protein-free portion of plasma-and not the proteins dissolved in this water-that can equilibrate across the capillary wall. For example, we can obtain $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in protein-free plasma (which clinicians call plasma water) by dividing the laboratory value for plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$by the plasma water content (usually 93\%):

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\text {plasma water }} } & =\frac{142 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma }}{0.93} \\
& =153 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma water }
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\text {plasma water }} } & =\frac{102 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma }}{0.93} \\
& =110 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma water }
\end{aligned}
$$

Table 5-2 lists solute concentrations in terms of both liters of plasma and liters of plasma water. If the plasma water fraction is $<93 \%$ because of hyperproteinemia (high levels of protein in blood) or hyperlipemia (high levels of lipid in blood), the values that the clinical laboratory reports for electrolytes may appear abnormal even though the physiologically important concentration (solute concentration per liter of plasma water) is normal. For example, if a patient's plasma proteins and lipids occupy $20 \%$ of plasma volume and consequently plasma water is only $80 \%$ of plasma, a correction factor of 0.80 (rather than 0.93 ) should be used in Equation 5-1. If the clinical laboratory were to report a very low plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$of $122 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L}$ plasma, the patient's $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$relevant to interstitial fluid would be $122 / 0.80=153 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L}$ plasma water, which is quite normal.

Effect of Protein Charge For noncharged solutes such as glucose, the correction for protein and lipid volume is the only correction needed to predict interstitial concentrations from plasma concentrations. Because plasma proteins carry a net negative charge and because the capillary wall confines them to the plasma, they tend to retain cations in plasma. Thus, the cation concentration of the protein-free solution of the interstitium is lower by $\sim 5 \%$. Conversely, because these negatively charged plasma proteins repel anions, the anion concentration of the protein-free solution of the interstitium is higher by $\sim 5 \%$. We consider the basis for these $5 \%$ corrections in the discussion of the Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium (see pp. 128-129).

Thus, for a monovalent cation such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the interstitial concentration is $95 \%$ of the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$of the protein-free plasma water, the value from Equation 5-1:

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\text {interstitium }} } & =153 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma water } \times 0.95 \\
& =145 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { interstitial fluid }
\end{aligned}
$$

For a monovalent anion such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the interstitial concentration is $105 \%$ of the $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$of the protein-free water of plasma, a value already obtained in Equation 5-2:

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\text {interstitium }} } & =110 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { plasma water } \times 1.05 \\
& =116 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L} \text { interstitial fluid }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, for cations (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), the two corrections (0.95/0.93) nearly cancel each other. On the other hand, for anions (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), the two corrections (1.05/0.93) are cumulative and yield a total correction of $\sim 13 \%$.

## All body fluids have approximately the same osmolality, and each fluid has equal numbers of positive and negative charges

Osmolality Despite the differences in solute composition among the intracellular, interstitial, and plasma compartments, they all have approximately the same osmolality. Osmolality describes the total concentration of all particles that are free in a solution. (5) NS-2 Thus, glucose contributes one particle, whereas fully dissociated NaCl contributes two. Particles bound to macromolecules do not contribute at all to osmolality. In all body fluid compartments, humans have an osmolality-expressed as the number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of water-of $\sim 290$ milliosmoles/ $\mathrm{kg} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}(290 \mathrm{mOsm})$.

Plasma proteins contribute $\sim 14 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L}$ (see Table 5-2). However, because these proteins usually have many negative charges per molecule, not many particles ( $\sim 1 \mathrm{mM}$ ) are necessary to account for these milliequivalents. Moreover, even though the protein concentration-measured in terms of grams per liter-may be high, the high molecular weight of the average protein means that the protein concentration-measured in terms of moles per literis very low. Thus, proteins actually contribute only slightly to the total number of osmotically active particles $(\sim 1 \mathrm{mOsm})$.

Summing the total concentrations of all the solutes in the cells and interstitial fluid (including metabolites not listed in Table 5-2), we would see that the total solute concentration of the intracellular compartment is higher than that of the interstitium. Because the flow of water across cell membranes is governed by differences in osmolality across the membrane, and because the net flow is normally zero, intracellular and extracellular osmolality must be the same. How, then, do we make sense of this discrepancy? For some ions, a considerable fraction of their total intracellular store is bound to cellular proteins or complexed to other small solutes. In addition, some of the proteins are themselves attached to other materials that are out of solution. In computing osmolality, we count each particle once, whether it is a free ion, a complex of two ions, or several ions bound to a protein. For example, most of the intracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and phosphate and virtually all the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are either complexed or bound. Some of the electrolytes in blood plasma are also bound to plasma proteins; however, the bound fraction is generally much lower than the fraction in the cytosol.

Electroneutrality All solutions must respect the principle of bulk electroneutrality: the number of positive charges in the overall solution must be the same as the number of negative charges. If we add up the major cations and anions in the cytosol (see Table 5-2), we see that the sum of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, greatly exceeds the sum of $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$. The excess positive charge reflected by this difference is balanced by the negative charge on intracellular macromolecules (e.g., proteins) as well as smaller anions such as organic phosphates.

There is a similar difference between major cations and anions in blood plasma, where it is often referred to as the anion gap. The clinical definition of anion gap is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Anion gap }_{\text {plasma }} & =\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\text {plasma }} \\
& \left.-\left(\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\text {plasma }}+\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {plasma }}\right)\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is ignored. The anion gap, usually 9 to $14 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{L}$, is the difference between ignored anions and ignored cations. Among the ignored anions are anionic proteins as well as small anionic metabolites. Levels of anionic metabolites, such as acetoacetate and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, can become extremely high, for example, in type 1 diabetic patients with very low levels of insulin (see Box 51-5). Thus, the anion gap increases under these conditions.

The differences in ionic composition between the ICF and ECF compartments are extremely important for normal functioning of the body. For example, because the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradient across cell membranes is a major determinant of electrical excitability, clinical disorders of extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$can cause life-threatening disturbances in the heart rhythm. Disorders of extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$cause abnormal extracellular osmolality, with water being shifted into or out of brain cells; if uncorrected, such disorders lead to seizures, coma, or death.

These examples of clinical disorders emphasize the absolute necessity of understanding the processes that control the volume and composition of the body fluid compartments. These processes are the ones that move water and solutes between the compartments and between the body and the outside world.

## SOLUTE TRANSPORT ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES

## In passive, noncoupled transport across a permeable membrane, a solute moves down its electrochemical gradient

We are all familiar with the way that water can flow from one side of a dike to another, provided the water levels on the two sides of the dike are different and the water has an open pathway (a breach in the dike) to move from one side to the other. In much the same way, a substance can passively move across a membrane that separates two compartments when there is both a favorable driving force and an open pathway through which the driving force can exert its effect.

When a pathway exists for transfer of a substance across a membrane, the membrane is said to be permeable to that substance. The driving force that determines the passive transport of solutes across a membrane is the electrochemical gradient or electrochemical potential energy difference acting on the solute between the two compartments. This electrochemical potential energy difference includes a contribution from the concentration gradient of the solute-the chemical potential energy difference-and, for charged solutes (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$), a contribution from any difference in voltage that exists between the two compartments-the electrical potential energy difference.

This concept of how force and pathway determine passive movement of solutes is most easily illustrated by the example of passive, noncoupled transport. Noncoupled transport of a substance X means that movement of X across the membrane is not directly coupled to the movement of any other solute or to any chemical reaction (e.g., the hydrolysis of

# N5-2 Osmolality versus Osmolarity 

## Contributed by Peter Aronson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Osmolality is a measure of the number of osmotically active particles per kilogram of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The number of particles is expressed in units of moles. Thus, 1 osmole is 1 mole of osmotically active particles. Note that we express osmolality in terms of the mass of solvent $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$, not the mass of the entire solution (i.e., solutes and solvent). Unfortunately, it is rather impractical to measure the mass of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in a solution (e.g., you could weigh the material before and after evaporating all the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). For that reason, chemists have introduced osmolarity, the number of osmotically active particles per liter of total solution. It is easy to determine this volume. For very dilute solutions, the osmolality and osmolarity are quantitatively almost identical. Even for interstitial fluid, osmolality and osmolarity differ by $<1 \%$. Thus, for all practical purposes, one could use these terms interchangeably. On the other hand, the osmometers used to determine the number of osmoles in body fluids are usually calibrated with standards that are labeled in terms of osmoles per kilogram of
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (i.e., osmolality). Therefore, in this text, we express the osmotic activity of solutions in terms of osmolality.

Blood plasma presents a special problem. Plasma proteins occupy $\sim 7 \%$ of the total volume of plasma, but cannot cross the capillary wall. The solution that equilibrates across the capillary wall is the protein-free part of the blood plasma, which clinicians refer to as "plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$." Therefore, the osmolality of the interstitial fluid will be the same as the osmolality of the protein-free portion of blood plasma. This value is $\sim 290$ milliosmoles/kg or 290 mOsm . The osmolality of the total volume of the blood plasma (i.e., the protein-free portion plus the proteins) is only 291 mOsm . The extra 1 mOsm is the osmotic pressure of the plasma proteins. This extra 1 mOsm has a special name: colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure (p. 128). The reason that the plasma proteins contribute so little is that-although they have a large mass-they have a high molecular weight and thus represent very few particles.

Figure 5-2 Uncoupled transport of a solute across a cell membrane. The net passive movement of a solute ( X ) depends on both the difference in concentration between the inside of the cell $\left(\mathrm{X}_{1}\right)$ and the outside of the cell $\left(\mathrm{X}_{0}\right)$ and the difference in voltage between the inside of the cell $\left(\psi_{i}\right)$ and the outside of the cell $\left(\psi_{o}\right)$.

ATP). What, then, are the driving forces for the net movement of X? Clearly, if the concentration of X is higher in the outside compartment $\left(\left[\mathrm{X}_{1}\right]_{o}\right)$ than in the inside compartment $\left(\left[\mathrm{X}_{2}\right]_{i}\right)$, and assuming no voltage difference, the concentration gradient will act as the driving force to bring about the net movement of X across the membrane from outside to inside (Fig. 5-2). If $[\mathrm{X}]$ is the same on both sides but there is a voltage difference across the membrane-that is, the electrical potential energy on the outside $\left(\psi_{o}\right)$ is not the same as on the inside $\left(\psi_{i}\right)$-this voltage difference will also drive the net movement of X , provided X is charged. The concentration gradient for X and the voltage difference across the membrane are the two determinants of the electrochemical potential energy difference for X between the two compartments. Because the movement of X by such a noncoupled mechanism is not directly coupled to the movement of other solutes or to any chemical reactions, the electrochemical gradient for X is the only driving force that contributes to the transport of X. Thus, the transport of X by a noncoupled, passive mechanism must always proceed "downhill," in the direction down the electrochemical potential energy difference for X .

Regardless of how X moves passively through the membrane-whether X moves through lipid or through a membrane protein-the direction of the overall driving force acting on X determines the direction of net transport. In the example in Figure 5-2, the overall driving force favors net transport from outside to inside (influx). However, X may still move from inside to outside (efflux). Movement of X across the membrane in one direction or the other is known as unidirectional flux. The algebraic sum of the two unidirectional fluxes is the net flux, or the net transport rate. Net transport occurs only when the unidirectional fluxes are unequal. In Figure 5-2, the overall driving force makes unidirectional influx greater than unidirectional efflux, which results in net influx.

When no net driving force is acting on X , we say that X is at equilibrium across the membrane and there is no net transport of X across the membrane. However, even when X is in equilibrium, there may be and usually are equal and opposite movements of X across the membrane. Net transport takes place only when the net driving force acting on X is displaced from the equilibrium point, and transport
proceeds in the direction that would bring X back to equilibrium.

Equilibrium is actually a special case of a steady state. In a steady state, by definition, the conditions related to X do not change with time. Thus, a transport system is in a steady state when both the driving forces acting on it and the rate of transport are constant with time. Equilibrium is the particular steady state in which there is no net driving force and thus no net transport.

How can a steady state persist when X is not in equilibrium? Returning to the dike analogy, the downhill flow of water can be constant only if some device, such as a pump, keeps the water levels constant on both sides of the dike. A cell can maintain a nonequilibrium steady state for X only when some device, such as a mechanism for actively transporting X , can compensate for the passive movement of X and prevent the intracellular and extracellular concentrations of X from changing with time. This combination of a pump and a leak maintains both the concentrations of X and the passive flux of X .

## At equilibrium, the chemical and electrical potential energy differences across the membrane are equal but opposite

As noted in the preceding section, the driving force for the passive, uncoupled transport of a solute is the electrochemical potential energy difference for that solute across the membrane that separates the inside (i) from the outside (o). We define the electrochemical potential energy difference as follows: (1) NS-3

$$
\frac{\Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\text { Electrochemical }}=\underbrace{R T \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{i}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Chemical } \\
\text { potential energy } \\
\text { difference }
\end{array}}+\underbrace{z_{\mathrm{X}} F\left(\psi_{1}-\psi_{\mathrm{o}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Electrical } \\
\text { potential energy } \\
\text { difference }
\end{array}}
$$

where $z_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the valence of $\mathrm{X}, T$ is absolute temperature, $R$ is the gas constant, and $F$ is the Faraday constant. The first term on the right-hand side of Equation 5-6, the difference in chemical potential energy, describes the energy change (joules per mole) as X moves across the membrane if we disregard the charge-if any-on X . The second term, the difference in electrical potential energy, describes the energy change as a mole of charged particles (each with a valence of $z_{\mathrm{X}}$ ) moves across the membrane. The difference $\left(\psi_{1}-\psi_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ is the voltage difference across the membrane $\left(V_{m}\right)$, also known as the membrane potential.

By definition, X is at equilibrium when the electrochemical potential energy difference for X across the membrane is zero:

$$
\Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{X}}=0
$$

Thus, $\Delta \tilde{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the net driving force (units: joules/mole). When $\Delta \tilde{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is not zero, X is not in equilibrium and will obviously tend either to enter the cell or to leave the cell, provided a pathway exists for X to cross the membrane.

It is worthwhile to consider two special cases of the equilibrium state (see Equation 5-7). First, when either the

where $[X]$ is the concentration (more precisely, the chemical activity) of the solute, $R$ is the gas constant ( $R=8.314$ joules/ [K - mole]), and $T$ is the temperature in kelvins $\left(\mathrm{K}=273.16+{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Thus, $\mu_{\mathrm{K}}$ has the units of energy per mole of $X$ (joule/mole). Note that "potential" in the often-used term chemical potential is shorthand for "chemical potential energy." In the case of a cell, we must consider the chemical potential energy both on the inside $\left(\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{I}}\right)$ and on the outside $\left(\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{o}}\right)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{I}}=R T \ln [\mathrm{X}]_{0} \\
& \mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{o}}=R T \ln \left[\mathrm{X}_{0}\right.
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, if $\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{o}}>\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{I}}$ (i.e., if $\left[\mathrm{X}_{0}\right.$ > [X]), then X will spontaneously move from the outside to the inside. On the other hand, if $\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{o}}<$ $\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{I}}$, then $X$ will spontaneously move from the inside to the outside.

We can define the chemical potential energy difference $\left(\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}} & =\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{I}}-\mu_{\mathrm{K}, \mathrm{O}} \\
& =R T \ln [\mathrm{X}]_{0}-R T \ln [\mathrm{X}]_{0} \\
& =R T \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}
\end{aligned}
$$

If solute $X$ is charged, we must also consider the difference in partial molar free energy $\left(\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}, \text { elec }}\right)$ due to the voltage difference across the cell membrane. If the voltage inside the cell is $\psi$, and the voltage outside the cell is $\psi_{0}$, then this voltage difference is $\left(\psi_{0}-\psi_{0}\right)$, which is also known as the membrane voltage $\left(V_{m}\right)$. This electrical portion of the partial molar free energy change is the electrical work (joules/mole) needed to move the charge, which is on $X$, across the membrane and into the cell. According to the laws of physics, the electrical work per mole is the product of the voltage difference and the amount of charge/mole moved. Thus, we must multiply the voltage difference (joules/coulomb) by the Faraday constant, $F$ (coulombs/mole), and the valence of the ion $\mathrm{X}, z_{0}$ (unitary charges/ion):

$$
\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}, \text { Elec }}=z_{0} F\left(\phi_{1}-\phi_{0}\right)
$$

The total free energy change $\left(\Delta \Omega_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ required to move $X$ into the cell is simply the sum of the chemical and electrical terms:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{K}} & =\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}}+\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{K}, \text { Elec }} \\
& =R T \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}{\left[\mathrm{X}_{0}\right]_{0}}+z_{0} F\left(\phi_{1}-\phi_{0}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation NE 5-6 is the same as Equation 5-6 on page 106 in the main text.

chemical or the electrical term in Equation 5-6 is zero, the other must also be zero. For example, when X is uncharged $\left(z_{\mathrm{X}}=0\right)$, as in the case of glucose, equilibrium can occur only when $[\mathrm{X}]$ is equal on the two sides of the membrane. Alternatively, when X is charged, as in the case of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, but the voltage difference (i.e., $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ ) is zero, equilibrium likewise can occur only when $[\mathrm{X}]$ is equal on the two sides of the membrane. Second, when neither the chemical nor the electrical term in Equation 5-6 is zero, equilibrium can occur only when the two terms are equal but of opposite sign. Thus, if we set $\Delta \tilde{\Omega}_{\mathrm{X}}$ in Equation 5-6 to zero, as necessary for a state of equilibrium,

$$
\begin{gathered}
0=R T \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}+z_{\mathrm{X}} F V_{\mathrm{m}} \\
-\frac{R T}{z_{\mathrm{X}} F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}=V_{\mathrm{m}} \\
V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{X}}=-\frac{R T}{z_{\mathrm{X}} F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

This relationship is the Nernst equation, which describes the conditions when an ion is in equilibrium across a membrane. Given values for $[\mathrm{X}]$, and $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}} \mathrm{X}$ can be in equilibrium only when the voltage difference across the membrane equals the equilibrium potential $\left(\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$, also known as the Nernst potential. Stated somewhat differently, $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the value that the membrane voltage would have to have for X to be in equilibrium. (5) N5-4 If we express the logarithm to the base 10, then for the special case in which the temperature is $29.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$,

$$
V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{X}}=-\frac{(60 \mathrm{mV})}{z_{\mathrm{X}}} \log _{10} \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}
$$

At normal body temperature $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, the coefficient is -61.5 mV instead of 60 mV . At $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, it is -58.1 mV . (5) N5-5

To illustrate the use of Equation 5-9 we compute $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ for a monovalent cation, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. If $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ is 100 mM and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is 10 mM , a 10 -fold concentration gradient, then

$$
E_{\mathrm{K}}=-\frac{(60 \mathrm{mV})}{1} \log _{10} \frac{100}{10}=-60 \mathrm{mV}
$$

Thus, a 10 -fold gradient of a monovalent ion such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is equivalent, as a driving force, to a voltage difference of 60 mV . For a divalent ion such as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, a 10 -fold concentration gradient can be balanced as a driving force by a voltage difference of $60 \mathrm{mV} / 2$, or only 30 mV .

## $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$ is the net electrochemical driving force acting on an ion

When dealing with an ion $(\mathrm{X})$, it is more convenient to think about the net driving force in voltage (units: millivolts) rather than electrochemical potential energy difference (units: joules per mole). If we divide all terms in Equation $5-6$ by the product of valence and the Faraday constant $\left(z_{\mathrm{X}} F\right)$, we obtain

$$
\frac{\frac{\Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathrm{Net}_{\text {driving }}}{ }_{\text {force }}=\frac{\frac{R T}{z_{\mathrm{X}} F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}}{-E_{\mathrm{X}}}+\frac{\left(\psi_{1}-\psi_{\mathrm{o}}\right)}{V_{\mathrm{m}}}
$$

Because the energy terms previously expressed as joules per mole were divided by coulombs per mole (i.e., $z_{\mathrm{X}} F$ )—all three energy terms enclosed in braces are now in units of joules per coulomb or volts. The term on the left is the net electrochemical driving force acting on ion X . The first term on the right, as defined in Equation 5-8, is the negative of the Nernst equilibrium potential $\left(-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$. The second term on the right is the membrane voltage $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$. Thus, a convenient equation expressing the net driving force is

$$
\text { Net driving force in volts }=\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)
$$

In Table 5-3, we use this equation-along with the values in Table 5-2 for extracellular (i.e., interstitial) and intracellular concentrations and a typical $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of -60 mV - to compute the net driving force of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. When the net driving force is negative, cations will enter the cell and anions will exit. Stated differently, when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more negative than $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ (i.e., the cell is too negative for X to be in equilibrium), a cation will tend to enter the cell and an anion will tend to exit.

## N5-4 Difference Between $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{x}}$

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Equation 5-6 on page 106 in the text (shown here as Equation NE 5-7) states that-for ion X-the electrochemical potential energy difference across the cell membrane is

$$
\frac{\Delta \bar{\mu}_{X}}{\frac{\text { Electrochemical }}{\text { potential energy }} \frac{R T \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}+\frac{2 \mu F\left(\psi_{1}-\psi_{0}\right)}{\frac{\text { Chemical }}{\text { potential energy }} \frac{\text { (NE 5-7) }}{\text { difference }}}
$$

Here, each of the three major terms enclosed by horizontal braces has the dimension of energy per mole (e.g., joules/ mole or kcal/mole). If we divide Equation NE 5-7 through by $z_{0} F$ we obtain:

Each of the three major terms in Equation NE 5-8 now has the dimension of voltage. In other words, in dividing an energy term (units: joules/mole) by $z_{0} F$ (units: coulombs/ mole), we are left with joules/coulomb, which is the definition of a volt. The first term on the right side of Equation NE 5-7 is nothing more than the negative of the Nernst potential that we introduced in Equation 5-8. The second term on the right side of Equation NE 5-8 is, of course, membrane potential. When $V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{b}}$, the ion is in equilibrium. Otherwise, the difference $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{b}}\right)$ is the net electrochemical driving forceexpressed in units of volts-that acts on ion $X$ as the ion crosses the membrane. On page 151 of the text, we use this force to derive an expression in Equation 6-15 for the electrical current carried by ion $X$ as the ion crosses the membrane:

$$
I_{X}=G_{0}\left(V_{m}-E_{b}\right)
$$

(NE 5-9)

Equation NE 5-9 is written in such a way that an inward current (i.e., the movement of a positively charged species into the cell or of a negatively charged species out of the cell) is negative.

Equation NE 5-9 allows us to predict the direction that ion $X$ will passively move (if indeed it can move at all) across the membrane. Of course, if $V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{b}}$, there will be no net movement of the ion at all. If $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more negative than $E_{\mathrm{b}}$, then the membrane voltage is too negative for $X$ to be in equilibrium. As a result, if $X$ is positive, the cation will tend to passively enter the cell. For example, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$generally tends to enter cells passively because $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ (e.g., -80 mV ) is generally more negative than $E_{\mathrm{be}}$ (e.g., +67 mV in Fig. 6-10). If $X$ is negative, the anion will tend to passively exit the cell. For example, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$generally tends to exit cells passively because, in most cells, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ $(-60 \mathrm{mV})$ is generally more negative than $E_{\mathrm{O}}$ (e.g., -47 mV ).

The opposite is true, of course, if $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more positive than $E_{\mathrm{b}}$.

## N5-5 60 mV per 10-fold Concentration Change

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

We start with Equation 5-8 (shown here as Equation NE 5-10):

$$
V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{X}}=-\frac{R T}{z_{0} F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}
$$

(NE 5-10)
$R$ is 8.314 joules/(K $\cdot$ mole), $F$ is 96,484 coulombs/mole, and $T$ is the temperature in kelvins $\left(\mathrm{K}=273.16+{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. In order to convert the natural logarithm to the logarithm in base 10, we must multiply the "In" term by $\ln (10)$, which is -2.303 . For the term 2.303 RTIF to be exactly 60 mV , the temperature must be $29.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(302.66 \mathrm{~K})$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
V_{\mathrm{m}} & =-\frac{1}{z_{\mathrm{X}}} \times-\frac{8.314 \text { joule }}{\mathrm{K} \cdot \text { mole }} \times 302.66 \mathrm{~K} \\
& \times \frac{\text { mole }}{96,484 \text { coulomb }} \times 2.303 \times \log _{10} \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}} \\
V_{\mathrm{m}} & =-\frac{1}{z_{\mathrm{X}}} \times-\frac{0.060 \text { joule }}{\text { coulomb }} \times \log _{10} \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}} \\
V_{\mathrm{m}} & =-\frac{1}{z_{\mathrm{X}}} \times 0.060 \text { volt } \times \log _{10} \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}} \\
V_{\mathrm{m}} & =E_{\mathrm{X}}=-\frac{(60 \mathrm{mV})}{z_{\mathrm{X}}} \times \log _{10} \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{1}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{0}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Indeed, this is Equation 5-9.

## In simple diffusion, the flux of an uncharged substance through membrane lipid is directly proportional to its concentration difference

The difference in electrochemical potential energy of a solute X across the membrane is a useful parameter because it allows us to predict whether X is in equilibrium across the cell membrane (i.e., Is $\Delta \overline{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}=0$ ?) or, if not, whether X would tend to passively move into the cell or out of the cell. As long as the movement of X is not coupled to the movement of another substance or to some biochemical reaction, the only factor that determines the direction of net transport is the driving force $\Delta \overline{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}=0$. The ability to predict the movement of X is independent of any detailed knowledge of the actual transport pathway mediating its passive transport. In other words, we can understand the overall energetics of X transport without knowing anything about the transport mechanism itself, other than knowing that it is passive.

So far, we have discussed only the direction of net transport, not the rate. How will the rate of X transport vary if we vary the driving force $\Delta \overline{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}$ ? Unlike determining the direction, determining the rate-that is, the kinetics-of transport requires knowing the peculiarities of the actual mechanism that mediates passive X transport.

Most transport systems are so complicated that a straightforward relationship between transport rate and $\Delta \overline{\mathrm{u}}_{\mathrm{X}}$ may not exist. Here we examine the simplest case, which is simple diffusion. How fast does an uncharged, hydrophobic solute move through a lipid bilayer? Gases (e.g., $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ), a few endogenous compounds (e.g., steroid hormones), and many drugs (e.g., anesthetics) are both uncharged and hydrophobic. Imagine that such a solute is present on both sides of the membrane but at a higher concentration on the outside (see Fig. 5-2). Because X has no electrical charge and because $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is greater than $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}$, the net movement of X will be into the cell. How fast X moves is described by its flux $\left(J_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$; namely, the number of moles of X crossing a unit area of membrane (typically $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ ) per unit time (typically 1 second). Thus, $J_{\mathrm{X}}$ has the units of moles/(square centimeter $\cdot$ second). The better that X can dissolve in the membrane lipid (i.e., the higher the lipid-water partition coefficient of X ), the more easily X will be able to traverse the membrane-lipid barrier. The flux of X will also be greater if X moves more readily once it is in the membrane (i.e., a higher diffusion coefficient) and if the distance that it must traverse is short (i.e., a smaller membrane thickness). We can combine these three factors into a single parameter called the permeability coefficient of $\mathbf{X}\left(\boldsymbol{P}_{\mathbf{X}}\right)$.
(5) NS-6 Finally, the flux of X will be greater as the difference in $[\mathrm{X}]$ between the two sides of the membrane increases (a large gradient).

These concepts governing the simple diffusion of an electrically neutral substance were quantified by Adolf Fick in the 1800s and applied by others to the special case of a cell membrane. They are embodied in the following equation, which is a simplified version of Fick's law:

$$
J_{\mathrm{X}}=P_{\mathrm{X}}\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}\right)
$$

As already illustrated in Figure 5-2, we can separate the net flux of X into a unidirectional influx $\left(J_{\mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{i→} \mathrm{H}}\right)$ and a
unidirectional efflux $\left(J_{\mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{i} \rightarrow \mathrm{n}}\right)$. The net flux of X into the cell is simply the difference between the unidirectional fluxes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Unidirectional influx: } J_{\mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{o} \rightarrow \mathrm{i}}=P_{\mathrm{X}}[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}} \\
& \text { Unidirectional efflux: } J_{\mathrm{X}}^{\mathrm{i} \rightarrow \mathrm{ni}}=P_{\mathrm{X}}[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}} \\
& \text { Net flux: } J_{\mathrm{X}}=P_{\mathrm{X}}\left([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, unidirectional influx is proportional to the outside concentration, unidirectional efflux is proportional to the inside concentration, and net flux is proportional to the concentration difference (not the ratio $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}} /[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}$, but the difference $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}$ ). In all cases, the proportionality constant is $P_{\mathrm{X}}$.

A description of the kinetic behavior of a transport system (see Equation 5-14)-that is, how fast things move-cannot violate the laws of energetics, or thermodynamics (see Equation 5-6)-that is, the direction in which things move to restore equilibrium. For example, the laws of thermodynamics (see Equation 5-6) predict that when the concentration gradient for a neutral substance is zero (i.e., when $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}} /$ $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}=1$ ), the system is in equilibrium and therefore the net flux must be zero. The law of simple diffusion (see Equation 5-14), which is a kinetic description, also predicts that when the concentration gradient for a neutral substance is zero (i.e., $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}=0$ ), the flux is zero.

## Some substances cross the membrane passively through intrinsic membrane proteins that can form pores, channels, or carriers

Because most ions and hydrophilic solutes of biological interest partition poorly into the lipid bilayer, simple passive diffusion of these solutes through the lipid portion of the membrane is negligible. Noncoupled transport across the plasma membrane generally requires specialized pathways that allow particular substances to cross the lipid bilayer. In all known cases, such pathways are formed from integral membrane proteins. Three types of protein pathways through the membrane are recognized:

1. The membrane protein forms a pore that is always open (Fig. 5-3A). Physiological examples are the porins in the outer membranes of mitochondria, cytotoxic poreforming proteins such as the perforin released by lymphocytes, and perhaps the aquaporin water channels. A physical equivalent is a straight, open tube. If you look though this tube, you always see light coming through from the opposite side.
2. The membrane protein forms a channel that is alternately open and closed because it is equipped with a movable barrier or gate (see Fig. 5-3B). Physiological examples include virtually all ion channels, such as the ones that allow $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to cross the membrane. The process of opening and closing of the barrier is referred to as gating. Thus, a channel is a gated pore, and a pore is a nongated channel. A physical equivalent is a tube with a shutter near one end. As you look through this tube, you see the light flickering as the shutter opens and closes.
3. The membrane protein forms a carrier surrounding a conduit that never offers a continuous transmembrane path because it is equipped with at least two gates that are

# N5-6 Definition of the Permeability Coefficient 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The permeability coefficient $(P)$ is

$$
P=\frac{D \times \beta}{a}
$$

$D$ is the diffusion coefficient (in $\mathrm{cm}^{2} / \mathrm{s}$ ), $\beta$ is the partition coefficient (concentration in the lipid divided by the concentration in the bulk aqueous phase; a dimensionless number), and $a$ is the thickness of the membrane (in cm). Thus, the units of the permeability coefficient are $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{s}$.

$$

Carriers are conduits that are gated by two "doors" that are never open at the same time.

never open at the same time (see Fig. 5-3C). Between the two gates is a compartment that can contain one or more binding sites for the solute. If the two gates are both closed, one (or more) of the transiting particles is trapped, or occluded, in that compartment. Physiological examples include carriers that move single solutes through the membrane by a process known as facilitated diffusion, which is discussed in the next section. A physical equivalent is a tube with shutters at both ends. As you look through this tube, you never see any light passing through because both shutters are never open simultaneously.

## Water-filled pores can allow molecules, some as large as 45 kDa , to cross membranes passively

Some membrane proteins form pores that provide an aqueous transmembrane conduit that is always open (see Fig. 5-3A). Among the large-size pores are the porins (Fig. 5-4) found in the outer membranes of gram-negative bacteria and mitochondria. Mitochondrial porin allows solutes as large as 5 kDa to diffuse passively from the cytosol into the mitochondria's intermembrane space.

One mechanism by which cytotoxic T lymphocytes kill their target cells is the release of monomers of a pore-forming

Figure 5-4 Structure of the PhoE porin of Escherichia coli. A, Top view of a porin trimer that shows the backbones of the polypeptide chains. Each of the three identical monomers, which are shown in different colors, contains 330 amino acids. The center of each monomer is a pore. B, Side view of a porin trimer. The extracellular surface is shown at the top. Each monomer consists of a $\beta$ barrel with 16 antiparallel $\beta$ sheets (i.e., adjacent polypeptide strands are oriented in opposite directions) surrounding a large cavity that at its narrowest point has an oval cross section (minimum and maximum internal diameters, $0.7 \times 1.1 \mathrm{~nm}$ ). The images are based on high-resolution electron microscopy at a resolution of $3.5 \AA(0.35 \mathrm{~nm})$. (From Jap BK, Walian PJ: Structure and functional mechanisms of porins. Physiol Rev 76:1073-1088, 1996.)
protein known as perforin. Perforin monomers polymerize within the target cell membrane and assemble like staves of a barrel to form large, doughnut-like channels with an internal diameter of 16 nm . The passive flow of ions, water, and other small molecules through these pores kills the target cell. A similar pore plays a crucial role in the defense against bacterial infections. The binding of antibodies to an invading bacterium ("classic" pathway), or simply the presence of
native polysaccharides on bacteria ("alternative" pathway), triggers a cascade of reactions known as the complement cascade. This cascade culminates in the formation of a doughnut-like structure with an internal diameter of 10 nm . This pore is made up of monomers of C9, the final component of the complement cascade.

The nuclear pore complex (NPC), which regulates traffic into and out of the nucleus (see p. 21), is remarkably large. The NPC is made up of at least 30 different proteins and has a molecular mass of $10^{8} \mathrm{Da}$ and an outer diameter of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~nm}$. It can transport huge molecules (approaching $10^{6}$ $\mathrm{Da})$ in a complicated process that involves ATP hydrolysis. In addition to this active component of transport, the NPC also has a passive component. Contained within the massive NPC is a simple aqueous pore with an internal diameter of $\sim 9 \mathrm{~nm}$ that allows molecules $<45 \mathrm{kDa}$ to move between the cytoplasm and nucleus but almost completely restricts the movement of globular proteins that are larger than $\sim 60 \mathrm{kDa}$.

The plasma membranes of many types of cells have proteins that form channels just large enough to allow water molecules to pass through. The first water channel to be studied was aquaporin 1 (AQP1), a $28-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein. AQP1 belongs to a larger family of aquaporins (AQPs) that has representatives in organisms as diverse as bacteria, plants, and animals. In mammals, the various AQPs have different tissue distributions, different mechanisms of regulation, and varying abilities to transport small neutral molecules other than water. In the lipid bilayer, AQP1 (Fig. 5-5) exists as tetramers. Each monomer consists of six membranespanning helices as well as two shorter helices that dip into the plane of the membrane. These structures form a permeation pathway for the single-file diffusion of water. For his discovery of the aquaporins, Peter Agre shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (5) NS-7

## Gated channels, which alternately open and close, allow ions to cross the membrane passively

Gated ion channels, like the AQPs just discussed, consist of one or more polypeptide subunits with $\alpha$-helical membranespanning segments. These channels have several functional components (see Fig. 5-3B). The first is a gate that determines whether the channel is open or closed, with each state reflecting a different conformation of the membrane protein. Second, the channel generally has one or more sensors that can respond to one of several different types of signals: (1) changes in membrane voltage, (2) second-messenger systems that act at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane protein, or (3) ligands, such as neurohumoral agonists, that bind to the extracellular face of the membrane protein. These signals regulate transitions between the open and closed states. A third functional component is a selectivity filter, which determines the classes of ions (e.g., anions or cations) or the particular ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) that have access to the channel pore. The fourth component is the actual open channel pore (see Fig. 5-3B). Each time that a channel assumes the open conformation, it provides a continuous pathway between the two sides of the membrane so that ions can flow through it passively by diffusion until the channel closes again. During each channel opening, many ions flow through the channel pore, usually a sufficient number to be

Na ${ }^{+}$Channels Because the electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathrm{m}}-\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ is always strongly negative (see Table 5-3), a large, inwardly directed net driving force or gradient favors the passive movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into virtually every cell of the body. Therefore, an open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel will act as a conduit for the passive entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. One physiological use for channel-mediated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry is the transmission of information. Thus, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are responsible for generating the action potential (e.g., "nerve impulse") in many excitable cells. Another physiological use of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels can be found in epithelial cells such as those in certain segments of the renal tubule and intestine. In this case, the $\mathrm{ENaC} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are largely restricted to the apical surface of the cell, where they allow $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to enter the epithelial cell from the renal tubule lumen or intestinal lumen. This passive influx is a key step in the movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the entire epithelium, from lumen to blood.
$\mathrm{K}^{+}$Channels The electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ is usually fairly close to zero or somewhat positive
(see Table 5-3), so $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is either at equilibrium or tends to move out of the cell. In virtually all cells, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels play a major role in generating a resting membrane voltage that is inside negative. Other kinds of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels play a key role in excitable cells, where these channels help terminate action potentials.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Channels The electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\left(\boldsymbol{V}_{\mathrm{m}}-\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{Ca}}\right)$ is always strongly negative (see Table 5-3), so $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ tends to move into the cell. When $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are open, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ rapidly enters the cell down a steep electrochemical gradient. This inward movement of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ plays a vital role in transmembrane signaling for both excitable and nonexcitable cells as well as in generating action potentials in some excitable cells.

Proton Channels The plasma membranes of many cell types contain $\mathrm{Hv} 1 \mathrm{H}^{+}$channels. Under normal conditions, the electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$generally tends to move $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into cells if Hv 1 channels are open (see Table 5-3). However, Hv1 channels tend to be closed under normal conditions and activate only when the membrane depolarizes or the cytoplasm acidifies-that is, when the driving force favors the outward movement of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Hv1 channels may therefore help mediate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$extrusion from the cell during states of strong membrane depolarization (e.g., during an action potential) or severe intracellular acidification.

Anion Channels Most cells contain one or more types of anion-selective channels through which the passive, noncoupled transport of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-and, to a lesser extent, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}-$ can take place. The electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-\boldsymbol{E}_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right)$ in most cells is modestly negative (see Table 5-3), so $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$tends to move out of these cells. In certain epithelial cells with $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels on their basolateral membranes, the passive movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$through these channels plays a role in the transepithelial movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from lumen to blood.

## Some carriers facilitate the passive diffusion of small solutes such as glucose

Carrier-mediated transport systems transfer a broad range of ions and organic solutes across the plasma membrane. Each carrier protein has a specific affinity for binding one or a small number of solutes and transporting them across the bilayer. The simplest passive carrier-mediated transporter is one that mediates facilitated diffusion. Below, we will introduce cotransporters (which carry two or more solutes in the same direction) and exchangers (which move them in opposite directions).

All carriers that do not either hydrolyze ATP or couple to an electron transport chain are members of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, $\bigcirc$ N5-8 which is organized according to the homology of the deduced amino-acid sequences (Table 5-4). Each of the 52 SLC families contains up to 53 genes that encode proteins that share a relatively high amino-acid sequence identity ( $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ ). Moreover, each gene may encode multiple variants (see Fig 4-19). Members of an SLC family may differ in molecular mechanism (i.e., facilitated diffusion, cotransport, exchange), kinetic properties (e.g., solute specificity and affinity),

regulation (e.g., phosphorylation), sites of membrane targeting (e.g., plasma membrane versus intracellular organelles), tissues in which they are expressed (e.g., kidney versus brain), or developmental stage at which they are expressed.

Carrier-mediated transport systems behave according to a general kinetic scheme for facilitated diffusion that is outlined in Figure 5-3C. This model illustrates how, in a cycle of six steps, a carrier can passively move a solute $X$ into the cell.

This mechanism can mediate only the downhill, or passive, transport of X. Therefore, it mediates a type of diffusion, called facilitated diffusion. When $[\mathrm{X}]$ is equal on the two sides of the membrane, no net transport will take place, although equal and opposite unidirectional fluxes of X may still occur.

In a cell membrane, a fixed number of carriers is available to transport X. Furthermore, each carrier has a limited speed with which it can cycle through the steps illustrated in Figure 5-3C. Thus, if the extracellular X concentration is gradually increased, for example, the influx of X will eventually reach a maximal value once all the carriers have become loaded with X. This situation is very different from the one that exists with simple diffusion-that is, the movement of a solute through the lipid phase of the membrane. Influx by simple diffusion increases linearly with increases in $[\mathrm{X}]_{\infty}$ with no maximal rate of transport. As an example, if X is initially absent on both sides of the membrane and we gradually increase $[\mathrm{X}]$ on one side, the net flux of $\mathrm{X}\left(J_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ is described by a straight line that passes through the origin (Fig. 5-6A). However, with carrier-mediated transport, $J_{\mathrm{X}}$ reaches a maximum $\left(J_{\max }\right)$ when $[\mathrm{X}]$ is high enough to occupy all the carriers in the membrane (see Fig. 5-6B). Thus, the relationship describing carrier-mediated transport follows the same Michaelis-Menten kinetics as do enzymes:

$$
V=\frac{[\mathrm{S}] V_{\max }}{K_{\mathrm{m}}+[\mathrm{S}]}
$$

This equation describes how the velocity of an enzymatic reaction $(V)$ depends on the substrate concentration ([S]), the Michaelis constant $\left(K_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, and the maximal velocity $\left(V_{\max }\right)$. The comparable equation for carrier-mediated transport is identical, except that fluxes replace reaction velocities:

Figure 5-7 Structure of the GLUT family of glucose transporters. The 12 membrane-spanning segments are connected to each other by intracellular and extracellular loops.

$$
J_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{[\mathrm{X}] J_{\max }}{K_{\mathrm{m}}+[\mathrm{X}]}
$$

Thus, $K_{m}$ is the solute concentration at which $J_{X}$ is half of the maximal flux $\left(J_{\max }\right)$. The lower the $K_{m}$, the higher the apparent affinity of the transporter for the solute.

Historically, the name carrier suggested that carriermediated transport occurs as the solute binds to a miniature ferryboat that shuttles back and forth across the membrane. Small polypeptides that act as shuttling carriers exist in nature, as exemplified by the antibiotic valinomycin. Such "ion carriers," or ionophores, bind to an ion on one side of the membrane, diffuse across the lipid phase of the membrane, and release the ion on the opposite side of the membrane. Valinomycin is a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ionophore that certain bacteria produce to achieve a selective advantage over their neighbors. However, none of the known carrier-mediated transport pathways in animal cell membranes are ferries.

Examples of membrane proteins that mediate facilitated diffusion are the GLUT glucose transporters (Fig. 5-7), members of the SLC2 family (see Table 5-4). The GLUTs have 12 membrane-spanning segments as well as multiple hydrophilic polypeptide loops facing either the ECF or the ICF. They could not possibly act as a ferryboat shuttling back and forth across the membrane. Instead, some of the membrane-spanning segments of carrier-mediated transport proteins most likely form a permeation pathway through the lipid bilayer, as illustrated by the amphipathic membranespanning segments 7,8 , and 11 in Figure 5-7. These membrane-spanning segments, as well as other portions of the protein, probably also act as the gates and solute-binding sites that allow transport to proceed in the manner outlined in Figure 5-3C.

The SLC2 family includes 14 transporters (GLUTs). Whereas GLUT1 is constitutively expressed on the cell surface, GLUT4 in the basal state is predominantly present in the membranes of intracellular vesicles, which represent

a storage pool for the transporters. Because a solute such as glucose permeates the lipid bilayer so poorly, its uptake by the cell depends strictly on the activity of a carrier-mediated transport system for glucose. Insulin increases the rate of carrier-mediated glucose transport into certain cells by recruiting the GLUT4 isoform to the plasma membrane from the storage pool (see p. 1047).

Two other examples of transporters that mediate facilitated diffusion are the urea transporter (UT) family, which are members of the SLC14 family (see Table 5-4), and the organic cation transporter (OCT) family, which are members of the SLC22 family. Because OCT moves an electrical charge (i.e., carries current), it is said to be electrogenic.

## The physical structures of pores, channels, and carriers are quite similar

Pores, ion channels, and carriers all have multiple transmembrane segments surrounding a solute permeation pathway. Moreover, some channels also contain binding sites within their permeation pathways, so transport is saturable with respect to ion concentration. However, pores, channels, and carriers are fundamentally distinct kinetically (Table 5-5). Pores, such as the porins, are thought to be continuously open and allow vast numbers of particles to cross the membrane. No evidence suggests that pores have conformational states. Channels undergo conformational transitions between closed and open states. When they are open, they are open to both intracellular and extracellular solutions simultaneously. Thus, while the channel is open, it allows multiple ions, perhaps millions, to cross the membrane per open event. Because the length of time that a particular channel remains open varies from one open event to the next, the number of ions flowing through that channel per open event is not fixed. Carriers have a permeation pathway that is virtually never open simultaneously to both intracellular and extracellular solutions. Whereas the fundamental event for a channel is opening, the fundamental event for a carrier is a complete cycle of conformational changes. Because the binding sites in a carrier are limited, each cycle of a carrier can transport only one or a small, fixed number of solute particles. Thus, the number of particles per second that can move across the membrane is generally several orders of magnitude lower for a single carrier than for a single channel.

We have seen how carriers can mediate facilitated diffusion of glucose, which is a passive or downhill process. However, carriers can also mediate coupled modes of
transport. The remainder of this section is devoted to these carriers, which act as pumps, cotransporters, and exchangers.

## The Na-K pump, the most important primary active transporter in animal cells, uses the energy of ATP to extrude $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and take up $\mathrm{K}^{+}$

Active transport is a process that can transfer a solute uphill across a membrane-that is, against its electrochemical potential energy difference. In primary active transport, the driving force needed to cause net transfer of a solute against its electrochemical gradient comes from the favorable energy change that is associated with an exergonic chemical reaction, such as ATP hydrolysis. In secondary active transport, the driving force is provided by coupling the uphill movement of that solute to the downhill movement of one or more other solutes for which a favorable electrochemical potential energy difference exists. A physical example is to use a motor-driven winch to lift a large weight into the air (primary active transport) and then to transfer this large weight to a seesaw, on the other end of which is a lighter child. The potential energy stored in the elevated weight will then lift the child (secondary active transport). For transporters, it is commonly the favorable inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient, which itself is set up by a primary active transporter, that drives the secondary active transport of another solute. In this and the next section, we discuss primary active transporters, which are also referred to as pumps. The pumps discussed here are all energized by ATP hydrolysis and hence are ATPases.

As a prototypic example of a primary active transporter, consider the nearly ubiquitous Na-K pump (or Na,KATPase, NKA). This substance was the first enzyme recognized to be an ion pump, a discovery for which Jens Skou shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (5) N5-9 The $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump is located in the plasma membrane and has both $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits (Fig. 5-8A). The $\alpha$ subunit, which has 10 transmembrane segments, is the catalytic subunit that mediates active transport. The $\beta$ subunit, which has one transmembrane segment, is essential for proper assembly and membrane targeting of the Na-K pump. Four $\alpha$ isoforms and two $\beta$ isoforms have been described. These isoforms have different tissue and developmental patterns of expression as well as different kinetic properties.

With each forward cycle, the pump couples the extrusion of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and the uptake of two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to the intracellular hydrolysis of one ATP molecule. By themselves, the

transport steps of the Na-K pump are energetically uphill; that is, if the pump were not an ATPase, the transporter would run in reverse, with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$leaking into the cell and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ leaking out. Indeed, under extreme experimental conditions, the Na-K pump can be reversed and forced to synthesize ATP! However, under physiological conditions, hydrolysis of one ATP molecule releases so much free energy-relative to the aggregate free energy needed to fuel the uphill movement of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions-that the pump is poised far from its equilibrium and brings about the net active exchange of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the desired directions.

Although animal cells may have other pumps in their plasma membranes, the Na-K pump is the only primary active transport process for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The Na-K pump is also the most important primary active transport mechanism for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. In cells throughout the body, the Na-K pump is responsible for maintaining a low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and a high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, relative to ECF. In most epithelial cells, the Na-K pump is restricted to the basolateral side of the cell.

The Na-K pump exists in two major conformational states: $\mathrm{E}_{1}$, in which the binding sites for the ions face the inside of the cell; and $\mathrm{E}_{2}$, in which the binding sites face the outside. The Na-K pump is a member of a large superfamily of pumps known as $\mathbf{E}_{1}-\mathbf{E}_{2}$ ATPases or P-type ATPases. It is the ordered cycling between these two states that underlies the action of the pump. Figure 5-8B is a simplified model showing the eight stages of this catalytic cycle of the $\alpha$ subunit:

Stage 1: ATP-bound $\mathbf{E}_{1} \cdot$ ATP state. The cycle starts with the ATP-bound $E_{1}$ conformation, just after the pump has released its bound $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to the ICF. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-binding sites face the ICF and have high affinities for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.
Stage 2: $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-bound $\mathrm{E}_{1} \cdot$ ATP $\cdot 3 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$state. Three intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions bind.
Stage 3: Occluded $\mathbf{E}_{1}-\mathbf{P} \cdot\left(\mathbf{3 N a}^{+}\right)$state. The ATP previously bound to the pump phosphorylates the pump at an aspartate residue. Simultaneously, ADP leaves. This phosphorylation triggers a minor conformational change in which the $E_{1}$ form of the pump now occludes the three bound $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions within the permeation pathway. In this state, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-binding sites are inaccessible to both the ICF and ECF.
Stage 4: Deoccluded $\mathbf{E}_{2}-\mathbf{P} \cdot \mathbf{3 N a}^{+}$state. A major conformational change shifts the pump from the $E_{1}$ to the $E_{2}$ conformation and has two effects. First, the pump becomes deoccluded, so that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-binding sites now communicate with the extracellular solution. Second, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$affinities of these binding sites decrease.
Stage 5: Empty $\mathbf{E}_{2}-\mathbf{P}$ state. The three bound $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions dissociate into the external solution, and the protein undergoes a minor conformational change to the empty $\mathbf{E}_{2}-\mathbf{P}$ form, which has high affinity for binding of extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. However, the pore still communicates with the extracellular solution.
Stage 6: $\mathbf{K}^{+}$-bound $\mathbf{E}_{2}-\mathbf{P} \cdot \mathbf{2 K}^{+}$state. Two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions bind to the pump.
Stage 7: Occluded $\mathbf{E}_{2} \cdot\left(\mathbf{2 K}^{+}\right)$state. Hydrolysis of the acylphosphate bond, which links the phosphate group to the aspartate residue, releases the inorganic phosphate into the intracellular solution and causes a minor
conformational change. In this $\mathrm{E}_{2} \cdot\left(2 \mathrm{~K}^{+}\right)$state, the pump occludes the two bound $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions within the permeation pathway so that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-binding sites are inaccessible to both the ECF and ICF.
Stage 8: Deoccluded $\mathbf{E}_{1} \cdot$ ATP $\cdot 2 \mathbf{K}^{+}$state. Binding of intracellular ATP causes a major conformational change that shifts the pump from the $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ back to the $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ state. This conformational change has two effects. First, the pump becomes deoccluded, so that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-binding sites now communicate with the intracellular solution. Second, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$affinities of these binding sites decrease.
Stage 1: ATP-bound $\mathbf{E}_{1} \cdot$ ATP state. Dissociation of the two bound $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions into the intracellular solution returns the pump to its original $\mathrm{E}_{1} \cdot$ ATP state, ready to begin another cycle.

Because each cycle of hydrolysis of one ATP molecule is coupled to the extrusion of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions from the cell and the uptake of two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions, the stoichiometry of the pump is three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and each cycle of the pump is associated with the net extrusion of one positive charge from the cell. Thus, the Na-K pump is electrogenic.

Just as glucose flux through the GLUT1 transporter is a saturable function of [glucose], the rate of active transport by the Na-K pump is a saturable function of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$. The reason is that the number of pumps is finite and each must bind three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions. The transport rate is also a saturable function of [ATP], and therefore depends on the metabolic state of the cell. In cells with high Na-K pump rates, such as renal proximal tubules, a third or more of cellular energy metabolism is devoted to supplying ATP to the Na-K pump.

A hallmark of the Na-K pump is that it is blocked by a class of compounds known as cardiac glycosides, examples of which are ouabain and digoxin; digoxin is widely used for a variety of cardiac conditions. These compounds have a high affinity for the extracellular side of the $\mathrm{E}_{2}-\mathrm{P}$ state of the pump, which also has a high affinity for extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Thus, the binding of extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$competitively antagonizes the binding of cardiac glycosides. An important clinical correlate is that hypokalemia (a low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in blood plasma) potentiates digitalis toxicity in patients.

## Besides the Na-K pump, other P-type ATPases include the H-K and Ca pumps

The family of P-type ATPases-all of which share significant sequence similarity with the $\alpha$ subunit of the Na-K pumpincludes several subfamilies.

H-K Pump Other than the Na-K pump, relatively few primary active transporters are located on the plasma membranes of animal cells. In the parietal cells of the gastric gland, an H-K pump (HKA) extrudes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the apical membrane into the gland lumen. Similar pumps are present in the kidney and intestines. The H-K pump mediates the active extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and the uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, all fueled by ATP hydrolysis, probably in the ratio of two $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions, two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions, and one ATP molecule. Like the Na-K pump, the H-K pump is composed of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits, each with multiple isoforms. The $\alpha$ subunit of the H-K pump also undergoes

phosphorylation through $\mathrm{E}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ intermediates during its catalytic cycle (see Fig. 5-8B) and, like the $\alpha$ subunit of the Na-K pump, is a member of the P2C subfamily of P-type ATPases. The Na-K and H-K pumps are the only two P-type ATPases with known $\beta$ subunits, all of which share significant sequence similarity.

Ca Pumps Most, if not all, cells have a primary active transporter at the plasma membrane that extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell. These pumps are abbreviated (for plasma-membrane Ca-ATPase), and at least four PMCA isoforms appear in the P2B subfamily of P-type ATPases. These pumps exchange one $\mathrm{H}^{+}$for one $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for each molecule of ATP that is hydrolyzed.

Ca pumps (or Ca-ATPases) also exist on the membrane surrounding such intracellular organelles as the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in muscle cells and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in other cells, where they play a role in the active sequestration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into intracellular stores. The SERCAs (for sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPases) appear to transport two $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and two $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions for each molecule of ATP hydrolyzed. (5) N5-10 The three known SERCAs, which are in the P2A subfamily of P-type ATPases, are expressed in different muscle types (see Table 9-1).

Other Pumps Among the other P-type ATPases is the copper pump ATP7B. This member of the P1B subfamily of P-type ATPases is mutated in Wilson disease (see Box 46-5).

## The F-type and the V-type ATPases transport $\mathrm{H}^{+}$

F-type or $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPases The ATP synthase of the inner membrane of mitochondria, also known as an F-type or $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase, catalyzes the final step in the ATP synthesis pathway. (1) N5-11

The $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase of mitochondria (Fig. 5-9A) looks a little like a lollipop held in your hand. The hand-like $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ portion is embedded in the membrane and serves as the pathway for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transport. The $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ portion has at least three different subunits ( $\mathrm{a}, \mathrm{b}$, and c ), for an overall stoichiometry of $\mathrm{ab}_{2} \mathrm{c}_{10-12}$. The lollipop-like $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ portion is outside the plane of the membrane and points into the mitochondrial matrix. The "stick" consists of a $\gamma$ subunit, with an attached $\varepsilon$ subunit. The "candy" portion of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$, which has the ATPase activity, consists of three alternating pairs of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits as well as an attached $\delta$ subunit. Thus, the overall stoichiometry of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ is $\alpha_{1} \beta_{1} \gamma \delta \varepsilon$. The entire $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ complex has a molecular mass of $\sim 500 \mathrm{kDa}$.

A fascinating property of the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase is that parts of it rotate. We can think of the hand, stick, and candy portions of the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase as having three distinct functions. (1) The hand (the c proteins of $\mathrm{F}_{0}$ ) acts as a turbine that rotates in the plane of the membrane, driven by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions that flow through the turbine-down the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$electrochemical gradient-into the mitochondrion. (2) The stick is an axle ( $\gamma$ and $\varepsilon$ subunits of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ ) that rotates with the turbine. (3) The candy (the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ ) is a stationary chemical factory-energized by the rotating axle-that synthesizes one ATP molecule for each 120-degree turn of the turbine/
axle complex. In addition, the a and b subunits of $\mathrm{F}_{0}$, and possibly the $\delta$ subunit of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$, form a stator that holds the candy in place while the turbine/axle complex turns. Paul Boyer and John Walker shared part of the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for elucidating this "rotary catalysis" mechanism. (1) N5-12

Under physiological conditions, the mitochondrial $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase runs as an ATP synthase (i.e., "backward" for an H pump)-the final step in oxidative phosphorylationbecause of a large, inwardly directed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane (see Fig. 5-9B). The citric acid cycle captures energy as electrons and transfers these electrons to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) (1) N5-13 and reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{FADH}_{2}\right)$. NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ transfer their high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain, which consists of four major complexes on the inner membrane of the mitochondrion (see Fig. 5-9B). As this "respiratory chain" transfers the electrons from one electron carrier to another, the electrons gradually lose energy until they finally combine with $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$and $1 / 2 \mathrm{O}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Along the way, three of the four major complexes of the respiratory chain (I, III, IV) pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the inner membrane into the intermembrane space (i.e., the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes). These "pumps" are not ATPases. The net result is that electron transport has established a large out-to-in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase-which is complex V in the respiratory chain-can now use this large electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions then flow backward (i.e., down their electrochemical gradient) into the mitochondrion through the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase, which generates ATP in the matrix space of the mitochondrion from ADP and inorganic phosphate. The entire process by which electron transport generates an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient and the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase harnesses this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient to synthesize ATP is known as the chemiosmotic hypothesis. Peter Mitchell, who proposed this hypothesis in 1961, received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in 1978. (1) N5-14

The precise stoichiometry is unknown but may be one ATP molecule synthesized for every three $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions flowing downhill into the mitochondrion (one $\mathrm{H}^{+}$for each pair of $\alpha \beta$ subunits of $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ ). (1) N5-15 If the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane reverses, the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase will actually function as an ATPase and use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out of the mitochondrion. Similar $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPases are also present in bacteria and chloroplasts.

V-type H Pump The membranes surrounding such intracellular organelles as lysosomes, endosomes, secretory vesicles, storage vesicles, and the Golgi apparatus contain a so-called vacuolar-type (or V-type) H-ATPase that pumps $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cytoplasm to the interior of the organelles. The low pH generated inside these organelles is important for sorting proteins, dissociating ligands from receptors, optimizing the activity of acid hydrolases, and accumulating neurotransmitters in vesicles. The apical membranes of certain renal tubule cells as well as the plasma membranes of certain other cells also have V-type H pumps that extrude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cell. These V-type H pumps, unlike the gastric

## N5-10 Crystal Structure of SERCA1

SERCA is a P-type ATPase, as is the Na-K pump. In 2000, Toyoshima and colleagues determined the x-ray crystal structure of SERCA with two $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions bound. This was the first crystal structure identified for any P-type pump or ATPase. In 2002, Toyoshima and Nomurai determined the x-ray crystal structure again, but with no $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ bound. In their 2004 paper, Toyoshima and Mizutani crystallized the protein with a bound nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP (adenylylimidodiphosphate) and one $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (under physiological conditions, ATP-the energy source-binds as a complex with $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ ), as well as two $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions (the transported species) occluded within a channel in the protein.

## N5-11 ATP Synthase: A Pump in Reverse

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The apparent paradox of how the same "pump" protein can act both as an ATPase and an ATP synthase can be resolved if we recognize that the pump can either hydrolyze ATP and use the energy to pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out of the mitochondrion or-in the physiological direction-use the energy of the inwardly directed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient to synthesize ATP.

## N5-13 NADH/NAD+ versus NADPH/NADP+

## Contributed by Alisha Bouzaher

NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$are, respectively, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and their close analogs are NADPH and NADP+, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The coenzymes NADH and NADPH each consist of two nucleotides joined at their phosphate groups by a phosphoanhydride bond. NADPH is structurally distinguishable from NADH by the additional phosphate group residing on the ribose ring of the nucleotide, which allows enzymes to preferentially interact with either molecule.

Total concentrations of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}\left(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\right)$ are higher in the cell by approximately 10 -fold compared to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}$ $\left(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\right)$. Ratios of the oxidized and reduced forms of these coenzymes offer perspective into the metabolic activity of the cell. The high NAD $+/ \mathrm{NADH}$ ratio favors the transfer of a hydride from a substrate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH, the reduced form of the molecule and oxidizing agent. Therefore, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is highly prevalent within catabolic reaction pathways where reducing equivalents (carbohydrate, fats, and proteins) transfer protons and electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. NADH acts as an energy carrier, transferring electrons from one reaction to another. Conversely, the NADP+/NADPH ratio is low, favoring the transfer of a hydride to a substrate oxidizing NADPH to NADP+ ${ }^{+}$. Thus, NADPH is utilized as a reducing agent within anabolic reactions, particularly the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

# N5-15 ATP Molecules Synthesized per NADH 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Glycolysis and the citric acid cycle generate the reducing equivalents NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, and then the inner membrane of the mitochondria converts the energy of these reducing equivalents to ATP in two steps. First, the electron transport chain uses the energy from NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ to pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space between the mitochondrial inner and outer membranes, converting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the final step. Second, the ATP synthase uses the energy stored in the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient to generate ATP from ATP plus inorganic phosphate.

## Generation of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$Gradient

For each NADH consumed in the inner matrix of the mitochondrion, it appears that complex I and complex III of the electron transport chain (see Fig. 5-9) each pump $4 \mathrm{H}^{+}$from the matrix, across the inner membrane, and into the intermembrane space, and complex IV pumps out an additional $2 \mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, for each NADH, the consensus is that the mitochondrion pumps $10 \mathrm{H}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ from succinate feeds into the electron transport chain at complex II (which is actually succinate dehydrogenase), bypassing complex I. Thus, for each $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, the consensus is that the mitochondrion pumps $6 \mathrm{H}^{+}$.

## Generation of ATP

Regardless of whether the reducing equivalents come from NADH or $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, the result of their being processed by the electron transport chain is a steep electrochemical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient across the inner membrane. The $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase, also located in the inner membrane, uses the energy in this inwardly directed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ gradient to synthesize ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate. In other words, the $\mathrm{F}_{0} \mathrm{~F}_{1}$ ATPase usually functions as an ATP synthase. As outlined in the text on page 118 and in Figure 5-9, the ATP synthase consists of (1) a group of 10 to 12 c subunits that forms an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$channel, which rotates like a turbine in the plane of the membrane as protons pass through the channel; (2) a shaft (consisting of the $\gamma$ and $\varepsilon$ subunits), which rotates with the turbine and extends into the mitochondrial matrix; the shaft also projects deeply into (3) a stationary globular structure that consists of three pairs of $\alpha \beta$ subunits. In addition, one a subunit, two b subunits, and a $\delta$ subunit hold the complex together.

At any one time, the $\beta$ subunit of one $\alpha \beta$ pair is empty ( $\beta$ empty), the $\beta$ subunit of another binds ADP + P, ( $\beta$-ADP), and the $\beta$ subunit of the third binds ATP ( $\beta$-ATP). (Note: P, is inorganic phosphate.) It is believed that each time three $\mathrm{H}^{+}$pass through the ATP synthase, the turbine ( 10 to 12 c subunits) and the shaft ( $\gamma$ and $\varepsilon$ subunits) rotate together by 120 degrees. This rotation brings the tip of the $\gamma$ subunit into contact with a new pair of $\alpha \beta$ subunits in the stationary $F_{1}$ portion of the ATP synthase, causing this $\beta$ subunit to shift from the $\beta$-ATP to the $\beta$-empty conformation-and release a just-synthesized ATP. Simultaneously, the previously empty $\beta$ subunit shifts from the $\beta$-empty to the $\beta$-ADP conformation (ready to create a new ATP), and the $\beta$ subunit that previously was binding ADP + P, creates a new ATP by shifting to the $\beta$-ATP conformation. Thus, each time a trio of protons passes through the ATP synthase into the mitochondrial inner matrix, the shaft rotates by 120 degrees and completes the synthesis of one ATP molecule. A complete 360degree rotation of the shaft (which would require nine protons) would generate three new ATP molecules, with each $\alpha \beta$ pair passing through each of the three possible conformations. It is important to note that the above $\mathrm{H}^{+} /$ATP stoichiometry is inferred
from the structure of the ATP synthase (three pairs of $\alpha \beta$ subunits) as well as a wealth of biochemical experiments.

## Ancillary Transport Processes

Even though the ATP synthase per se appears to have a stoichiometry of one ATP for every three protons, we have not addressed the overall process of ATP synthesis. As we shall see, the mitochondrion must accomplish two additional tasks in order to complete the process.

First, the mitochondrion must transport one $P$, into its inner matrix for each ATP to be synthesized. This uptake of $P_{i}$ appears to be accomplished by an $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$cotransporter. In other words, the mitochondrion must take up one $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(previously pumped out by the electron transport chain) to energize the uptake of each $P_{i}$.

Second, the mitochondrion must import one ADP ${ }^{3-}$ molecule for each ATP to be synthesized. In addition, the mitochondrion must export the newly synthesized ATP ${ }^{4-}$ molecule. Both jobs are accomplished by the same ADP-ATP exchanger, which is energized in part by the electrical gradient ( $\Delta \varphi$ ) that the electron transport chain generates along with the chemical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient as it pumps $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out across the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Thus, the consensus is that the mitochondrion needs to import four $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to synthesize one ATP molecule:

1. Three $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to energize a 120-degree turn of the ATP synthase and thus convert one ADP + one $P_{i}$ to one ATP.
2. One $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to take up the $P_{0}$

## Overall ATP/NADH Stoichiometry

In summary, it appears that, for each NADH processed, the electron transport chain extrudes 10 protons. Furthermore, it appears that the ATP synthase and ancillary transporters can generate one ATP molecule from the inward movement of four protons. Thus, the overall ATP/NADH stoichiometry would be 2.5 ATP molecules for each NADH molecule. Because the processing of $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ results in the extrusion of only six protons, the overall ATP/FADH 2 stoichiometry would be 1.5 ATP molecules for each $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ molecule. Keep in mind that these figureswhich we use in examples throughout the text after the first three printings of the text-are the best current estimates; more about this below.

## NADH Shuttle Mechanisms

An additional consideration is the access of NADH to complex I in the respiratory chain. In animal cells, the NADH must approach complex I from the matrix side of the mitochondrial inner membrane. This is not a problem for NADH generated inside the mitochondrial matrix by pyruvate dehydrogenase or the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 58-11). However, NADH generated by glycolysis (see Fig. 58-6A) cannot directly cross the mitochondrial inner membrane. As a result, animal cells use two complicated shuttle mechanisms to move the NADH reducing equivalents indirectly across the mitochondrial inner membrane.

Cells throughout most of the body-but not skeletal muscle or brain-use the malate-aspartate shuttle to bring NADH equivalents across the mitochondrial inner membrane into the mitochondrial matrix. The process, which is described in comprehensive biochemistry texts, involves six steps: (1) Malate dehydrogenase uses NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to convert oxaloacetate to malate in the intermembrane space, regenerating $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in the process. (2) The malate- $\alpha$-ketoglutarate exchanger in the

# N5-15 ATP Molecules Synthesized per NADH—cont'd 

mitochondrial inner membrane imports the malate into the matrix. (3) Malate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix uses $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to convert the newly imported malate back to oxaloacetate, regenerating $\mathrm{NADH}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the process. (4) Aspartate aminotransferase in the matrix converts the oxaloacetate and a glutamate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and aspartate. (5) The aforementioned malate- $\alpha$-ketoglutarate exchanger recycles the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate back to the intermembrane space, and the glutamate-aspartate exchanger does the same for aspartate. (6) In the intermembrane space, aspartate aminotransferase converts the newly exited aspartate and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate to glutamate and oxaloacetate, completing the cycle.

The net effect is to shuttle NADH indirectly into the matrix, where it can approach complex I. Using NADH shuttled in this way, the electron transport chain can pump 10 protons from the matrix into the intermembrane space, a number that can produce 2.5 ATP molecules.

Skeletal muscle and brain use a very different two-step method to process the NADH that is produced by glycolysis, the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle: (1) The cytosolic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase uses NADH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to convert dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol-3-phosphate, regenerating $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$in the process. (2) The enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane converts glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in the intermembrane space to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, thereby regenerating the latter and releasing it into the intermembrane space. In the process, the dehydrogenase converts FAD to $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$. Because this $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ enters the electron transport chain at complex III, it can fuel the extrusion of only six
protons across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Thus, using reducing equivalents shuttled this way, the electron transport chain has an ATP/NADH stoichiometry of only 1.5 ATP molecules per NADH molecule.

Note that after the third printing of the book, we have used the values of 2.5 or 1.5 ATP per NADH to indicate that the energy yield depends on the shuttle system. In the brain, of course, we can simply refer to the value of 1.5 (see Fig. 11-10).

## Our Confidence in the Cited Figures for the ATP/NADH Stoichiometry

Although the figures of 2.5 or 1.5 ATP molecules per NADH are the consensus, they should not be considered absolute at this time. Although investigators have invested considerable effort in attempting to determine the stoichiometry experimentally, the task is a daunting one for several reasons. First, some of the protons extruded by the electron transport chain can leak back into the mitochondrial matrix by pathways other than the ATP synthase. In fact, brown fat cells make use of this bypass to generate heat (see Fig. 57-6). Second, the proton traffic is computed from measured pH changes and values of buffering power that are sometimes difficult to know with certainty. Third, the precise stoichiometry of the $\mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$cotransporter depends on the precise pH values on either side of the mitochondrial inner membrane because the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ has a $\mathrm{p} K$ of $\sim 6.8$. Fourth, the intricacies of the ATP synthase have yet to be fully worked out (i.e., the stoichiometry may not always be precisely one ATP synthesized for every three protons entering through the ATP synthase per se).

Figure 5-9 The $F_{0} F_{1}$ ATPase and its role as the ATP synthase in the mitochondrial synthesis of ATP. A, A cartoon of the $F_{0} F_{1}$ ATPase. The pump has two functional units, $F_{0}$ (which historically stood for oligomycin-sensitive factor) and $F_{1}$ (which historically stood for factor 1). $F_{0}$ is the transmembrane portion that contains the ion channel through which the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$passes. The $\mathrm{F}_{1}$ is the ATPase. In one complete cycle, the downhill movement of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions causes the c subunits of $F_{0}$ and the axle formed by the subunits of F1 to rotate 360 degrees in three 120-degree steps, which causes the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits to sequentially synthesize and release 3 ATP molecules, for a synthase stoichiometry of $-3 \mathrm{H}^{+}$per ATP. However, the mitochondrion uses -1 additional $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to import inorganic phosphate ( P ) and to exchange cytosolic ADP for mitochondrial ATP. Thus, a total of $-4 \mathrm{H}^{+}$would be needed per ATP. B, Complexes I, III, and IV of the respiratory chain use the energy of NADH to pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out of the mitochondrial matrix; the consensus is $10 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ ions per NADH molecule. The resulting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient causes the mitochondrial $F_{0} F_{1}$ ATPase to run as an ATP synthase. Thus, the mitochondrion synthesizes $\left(10 \mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}\right) \times\left(1 \mathrm{ATP} / 4 \mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=2.5 \mathrm{ATP} / \mathrm{NADH}$. Similarly, the consensus is that complexes III and IV use the energy of $1 \mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ molecule to pump $6 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ions out of the mitochondrial matrix (not shown). Thus, the mitochondrion synthesizes $\left(6 \mathrm{H}^{+} / \mathrm{FADH}_{2}\right) \times\left(1 \mathrm{ATP} / 4 \mathrm{H}^{+}\right)=1.5 \mathrm{ATP} / \mathrm{FADH}_{2}$.

H-K pump, are independent of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Instead, the V-type H pump is similar to the hand-held lollipop-like structure of the F-type ATPase, with which it shares a significantalthough low-level of amino-acid homology. For example, the hand of the V-type pump has only six subunits, but each is twice as large as a c subunit in the F-type ATPase.

## ATP-binding cassette transporters can act as pumps, channels, or regulators

The so-called ABC proteins all have a motif in their aminoacid sequence that is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC). In
humans, this family includes at least 49 members in seven subfamilies named ABCA through ABCG (Table 5-6). Some are pumps that presumably hydrolyze ATP to provide energy for solute transport. Some may hydrolyze ATP, but they do not couple the liberated energy to perform active transport. In other cases, ATP regulates ABC proteins that function as ion channels or regulators of ion channels or transporters.

ABCA Subfamily ABC 1 (ABCA1) is an important transporter for mediating the efflux of phospholipids and cholesterol from macrophages and certain other cells.

*In parentheses is the number of human genes in the family.
${ }^{+}$The nomenclature of the MDRs is especially confusing because different and conflicting numbering systems have been used for different species; we use the human numbering system.

MDR Subfamily The multidrug-resistance transporters (MDRs) are ATPases and primary active transporters. The MDR proteins are tandem repeats of two structures, each of which has six membrane-spanning segments and a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) that binds ATP. MDR1, also called P-glycoprotein, extrudes cationic metabolites and drugs across the cell membrane. The substrates of MDR1 appear to have little in common structurally, except that they are hydrophobic. A wide variety of cells express MDRs, including those of the liver, kidney, and gastrointestinal tract. MDR1 plays an important and clinically antagonistic role in cancer patients in that it pumps a wide range of anticancer drugs out of cancer cells, thereby rendering cells resistant to these drugs.

MRP/CFTR Subfamily Another member of the ABC superfamily that is of physiological interest is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which is mutated in the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis (Box 43-1). CFTR is a $170-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein that is present at the apical

A large cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain separates the two halves of the molecule, each of which has an ATP-binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2). The most common mutation in cystic fibrosis is the deletion of the phenylalanine at position 508 (ΔF508) in the NBD1 domain.

membrane of many epithelial cells. CFTR functions as a lowconductance $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel as well as a regulator of other ion channels.

Like MDR1, CFTR has two membrane-spanning domains (MSD1 and MSD2), each composed of six membranespanning segments (Fig. 5-10). Also like MDR1, CFTR has two NBDs (NBD1 and NBD2). Unlike MDR1, however, a large cytoplasmic regulatory (R) domain separates the two halves of CFTR. The regulatory domain contains multiple potential protein kinase A and protein kinase C phosphorylation sites. Phosphorylation of these sites, under the influence of neurohumoral agents that control fluid and electrolyte secretion, promotes activation of CFTR. The binding of ATP to the NBDs also controls channel opening and closing. Thus, ATP regulates the CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel by two types of mechanisms: protein phosphorylation and interaction with the NBDs. (5) NS-16

## Cotransporters, one class of secondary active transporters, are generally driven by the energy of the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient

Like pumps or primary active transporters, secondary active transporters can move a solute uphill (against its electrochemical gradient). However, unlike the pumps, which fuel the process by hydrolyzing ATP, the secondary active transporters fuel it by coupling the uphill movement of one or more solutes to the downhill movement of other solutes. The two major classes of secondary active transporters are cotransporters (or symporters) and exchangers (or

# N5-16 Regulation of the CFTR Channel by ATP

CFTR is phosphorylated by protein kinase A (PKA) at several sites within its R domain (eFig. 5-1). Modest phosphorylation causes a conformational change in the R domain that makes NBD1 accessible to ATP. Additional phosphorylation also makes NBD2 accessible to ATP. When ATP binds to NBD1 and is subsequently hydrolyzed, the channel opens, but it then rapidly closes once the ADP and phosphate dissociate ("flickery opening"). However, if a second ATP binds to NBD2, the channel is stabilized in its open state ("long opening"). ATP hydrolysis at NBD2 terminates
the long opening and is thus necessary for CFTR to return to its closed state. Dephosphorylation of the R domain by protein phosphatases returns CFTR to its resting state. The control of CFTR by ATP hydrolysis is reminiscent of the control of G-protein activity by GTP hydrolysis (see p. 53).

The R domain of CFTR can also be phosphorylated by PKC. PKC enhances the stimulatory effect of PKA on CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transport, but alone it appears to have little direct effect on CFTR function.

antiporters). Cotransporters are intrinsic membrane proteins that move the "driving" solute (the one whose gradient provides the energy) and the "driven" solutes (which move uphill) in the same direction.

Na/Glucose Cotransporter The Na/glucose cotransporter (SGLT) is located at the apical membrane of the cells that line the proximal tubule and small intestine (Fig. 5-11A). The SGLTs, which belong to the SLC5 family (see Table 5-4), consist of a single subunit with 14 membrane-spanning segments. SGLT2 moves one $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion with each glucose molecule (i.e., $1: 1$ stoichiometry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to glucose), whereas the SGLT1 isoform moves two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions with each glucose molecule. Drugs that inhibit SGLT2 are useful in treating type 2 diabetes in adults because these agents reduce glucose reabsorption in the kidney, thereby lowering plasma [glucose]. (5) N5-17

For an $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter with $1: 1$ stoichiometry, the overall driving force is the sum of the electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and the chemical potential energy difference for glucose. Thus, the highly favorable, inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient can drive the uphill accumulation of glucose from the lumen of the kidney tubule or gut into the cell. Figure 5-12 shows how the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient drives glucose accumulation into membrane vesicles derived from the brush border of renal proximal tubules. Equilibrium is achieved when the electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in one direction is balanced by the chemical potential energy difference for glucose in the opposite direction:

$$
\Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}}=-\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}
$$

We can express $\Delta \tilde{\mathbf{u}}_{\mathrm{Na}}$ in terms of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations and membrane voltage and can express $\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}$ in terms of the glucose concentrations. (5) N5-18 If we substitute these expressions into Equation 5-17, we derive the following relationship for the maximal glucose concentration gradient that can be generated by a given electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$:

$$
\frac{[\text { Glucose }]_{i}}{[\text { Glucose }]_{0}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{0}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}} \times 10^{-V_{\mathrm{in}} /(60 \mathrm{mV})}
$$

In an epithelial cell that has a 10 -fold $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration gradient and a $60-\mathrm{mV}$ inside-negative voltage across the apical membrane, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient can generate a $10 \times 10^{1}$, or 100 -fold, glucose concentration gradient across the plasma membrane. In other words, the $10: 1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ concentration gradient buys a 10 -fold glucose gradient, and the $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ of $\sim 60 \mathrm{mV}$ buys another 10 -fold. However, the leakage of glucose out of the cell by other pathways at the basolateral membrane prevents the $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter from coming to equilibrium.

An $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter with $2: 1$ stoichiometry is capable of generating an even larger concentration gradient for glucose across the plasma membrane. Such a cotransporter would be in equilibrium when

# N5-17 Clinical Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

SGLT2 inhibitors are novel "glucuretics" that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The low-affinity, high-capacity cotransporter SGLT2 reabsorbs the bulk of the filtered glucose in the S1/S2 segments of the proximal convoluted tubule, whereas the low-affinity, high-capacity cotransporter SGLT1 in the S3 segment reabsorbs the remainder. Thus, specific SGLT2 inhibition causes the bulk of filtered glucose to be excreted in the urine, whereas about $10 \%$ of filtered glucose is still reabsorbed by SGLT1, so that [glucose] ${ }_{\text {plasma }}$ is prevented from falling below normal. However, in clinical practice, SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of renal glucose reabsorption.

Phlorizin, the $2^{\prime}$-glucoside of phloretin, is a natural compound in the bark of fruit trees and a competitive inhibitor of both SGLT1
and SGLT2. Before the discovery of insulin, phlorizin was used in the treatment of diabetes, although the compound is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract and not stable. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two specific SGLT2 inhibitors for oral use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: canagliflozin and dapagliflozin (Farxiga®). Urinary tract infections and genital fungal infections are common adverse effects of this treatment due to chronically high glucose concentration in the urine.

## N5-18 Maximal Glucose Gradient Achievable by SGLT1 and SGLT2

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

## SGLT2

As noted on page 121 (see Equation 5-17; shown here as Equation NE 5-14), SGLT2-the Na/glucose cotransporter with a 1:1 stoichiometry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to glucose-is in equilibrium when

$$
\Delta \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}}=-\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{Glucose}}
$$

(NE 5-14)
$\Delta \overline{\mathbf{u}}_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is the electrochemical energy difference across the cell membrane for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}$ is the chemical energy difference for glucose (because glucose has no charge, the electrical energy difference for glucose across the membrane is zero). Starting from the definition of electrochemical energy difference in Equation 5-6, we can express $\Delta \overline{\mathbf{u}}_{\mathrm{Na}}$ in terms of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations and membrane potential:

$$
\Delta \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}}=R T \ln \left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{ic}}}\right)+z F V_{\mathrm{an}}
$$

(NE 5-15)
Similarly, we can express $\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}$ in terms of the glucose concentrations:

$$
\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}=R T \ln \left(\frac{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{c}}}{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{ic}}}\right)
$$

(NE 5-16)
If we substitute these last two expressions into Equation NE 5-14, we obtain the following equation, which describes the
relationships between the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose concentrations when SGLT2 is in equilibrium:

$$
\frac{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{c}}}{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{ic}}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}} \times 10^{\left(\bar{\alpha}_{\mathrm{c}}-4 / 2000 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / 2\right)}
$$

## SGLT1

As noted in the text in Equation 5-19 (shown here as Equation NE 5-18), SGLT1-the Na/glucose cotransporter with a 2:1 stoichiometry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to glucose-is in equilibrium when

$$
2 \Delta \bar{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}}=-\Delta \mu_{\text {glucose }}
$$

(NE 5-18)
If we substitute Equations NE 5-15 and NE 5-16 into Equation NE 5-18, we obtain the following equation, which describes the relationships between the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose concentrations when SGLT1 is in equilibrium:

$$
\frac{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{c}}}{[\text { Glucose }]_{\mathrm{ic}}}=\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)^{2} \times 10^{-2 V_{\mathrm{in}} / 80 \mathrm{~m}^{2} / 2)} \quad(\text { NE 5-19) }
$$

We can use Equation NE 5-17 (for SGLT2) and Equation 5-6 (for SGLT1) to compute the maximum achievable glucose gradients. Simply insert the values for $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}},\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{ic}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ as discussed on page 121 .

![bo1104543376c](bo1104543376c.jpg)

Figure 5-12 $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven glucose uptake into brush-border membrane vesicles. (0) NS-22

The maximal glucose gradient is

$$
\frac{[\text { Glucose }]_{o}}{[\text { Glucose }]_{o}}=\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{o}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}}\right)^{2} \times 10^{-2 V_{m} /(60 \mathrm{mV})}
$$

In the same epithelial cell with a 10 -fold $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration gradient and a $V_{m}$ of -60 mV , the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient can generate a glucose concentration gradient of $10^{2}$ $\times 10^{3}$, or 10,000 -fold! In other words, the $10: 1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration gradient-when squared for two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions-buys a 100 -fold glucose gradient, and the -60 mV membrane voltage-when multiplied by two for the effective charge on two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions-buys another 100 -fold.

Because the cotransporter protein has specific sites for binding $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose and because the number of transporters is fixed, the rate of transport by SGLT is a saturable function of the glucose and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations.
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-Driven Cotransporters for Organic Solutes Functionally similar, but structurally distinct from one another, are a variety of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$cotransporters in the proximal tubule and small intestine. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven amino-acid transporters (see Fig. 5-11B) belong to both the SLC6 and SLC38 families (see Table 5-4). SLC13 includes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransporters for monocarboxylates, dicarboxylates, and tricarboxylates; SLC5 includes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransporters for monocarboxylates.
$\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Cotransporters The $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (NBCs) belong to the SLC4 family. (5) NS-19 and are a key group of acid-base transporters. In the basolateral membranes of certain epithelial cells, the electrogenic NBCs (NBCe1/e2, $e$ for electrogenic) appear to operate with an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of 1:3 (see Fig. 5-11D) and-for typical ion and voltage gradients-mediate electrogenic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$efflux. Here, these NBCs mediate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$absorption into the blood. In most other cells, these same two transporters operate with a stoichiometry of $1: 2$-probably because of the absence of a key protein partner-and mediate the electrogenic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$influx (see Fig. 5-11E). Finally, the electroneutral NBCs (NBCn1/n2, $n$ for electroneutral) operate with an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of 1:1 (see Fig. 5-11F) and also mediate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$influx. In these last two cases, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient drives the uphill accumulation of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, which is important for epithelial $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion and for the regulation of intracellular $\mathrm{pH}(\mathrm{pH}$.) to relatively alkaline values.
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-Driven Cotransporters for Other Inorganic Anions Important examples of other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven cotransporters include the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{I}$ cotransporter (SLC5A5), the sulfate cotransporter (SLC13 family; see Table 5-4), and the inorganic phosphate cotransporter (NaPi; see Fig. 5-11C)which are members of the SLC17, SLC20, and SLC34 families.
$\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ Cotransporter The three types of cation-coupled $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$cotransporters all belong to the SLC12 family. The first is the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NKCC), which harnesses the energy of the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient to drive the accumulation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 5-11G). One variant of this cotransporter, NKCC1 (SLC12A2), is present in a wide variety of nonepithelial cells (see p. 131), as well as in the basolateral membranes of some epithelial cells. Another variant of this cotransporter, NKCC2 (SLC12A1), is present on the apical membrane of cells lining the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney (see p. 757). A characteristic of the NKCCs is that they are inhibited by furosemide and bumetanide, which are called loop diuretics because they increase urine flow by inhibiting transport at the loop of Henle. Because of its sensitivity to bumetanide, NKCC is sometimes called the bumetanidesensitive cotransporter (BSC).

# N5-19 $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Transporters in the SLC4 Family 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

So far, investigators have identified ten human genes in the SLC4 family of solute carriers. These genes include three that encode $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers (the so-called anion exchangers, or AE1, AE2, and AE3), and five that encode $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters. In addition, one gene encodes an Na/borate cotransporter, and another gene encodes a protein-termed AE4-of controversial function. For a discussion of these subjects, consult the review by Romero and colleagues.

The five $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters include the two electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (NBCe1 and NBCe2), two electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (NBCn1 and NBCn2), and a single $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (NDCBE).

NBCe1 and NBCe2 appear to be able to transport $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of either $1: 3$ (as in the renal proximal tubule; see Fig. 39-4A) or 1:2 (as in most other cells, including the pancreatic duct; Fig. 43-6). Preliminary evidence from the laboratory of Boron suggests that NBCe1 and NBCe2at least when operating with a stoichiometry of $1: 2$-in fact transport $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ rather than $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Of course, $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ arises from $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the reaction $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$, which has a pK of $\sim 10.3$.

NDCBE appears to move $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions into the cell in exchange for $1 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(which moves out of the cell). Extensive kinetic data are consistent with the hypothesis that the NDCBE from the squid axon in fact transports either $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$plus $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ (in exchange for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) or perhaps the $\mathrm{NaCO}_{3}^{-}$ion pair (in exchange for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$). The $\mathrm{NaCO}_{3}$ forms rapidly, and reversibly, from $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}: \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{NaCO}_{3}^{-}$

Work on NBCn2 (Parker et al, 2008) is consistent with the hypothesis that this electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporterwhich appears to transport $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the cell-may in fact mediate the uptake of $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ in exchange for 1 intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The net effect of exchanging 1 extracellular $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ for 1 intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$would be the uptake of $1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. In fact, it is intriguing to speculate that all members of the SLC4 family are in fact exchangers, and that the proteins that appear to mediate cotransport in fact mediate an exchange that "nets out" as apparent cotransport.

In addition to the SLC4 family, several members of the SLC26 family can also carry $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, although these SLC26 proteins tend to be less selective in the anions that they transport. For a review of this gene family, consult Alper and Sharma.

## N5-22 Using Membrane Vesicles to Study Glucose Transport

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

We describe the membrane-vesicle technique in $\bigcirc$ N33-5. Figure 5-12 illustrates the use of this technique to explore how the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient affects glucose uptake. The vesicles are made from brush-border membrane vesicles (i.e., made from the apical membrane of the proximal tubule). In the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the experimental medium, glucose enters renal brush-border membrane vesicles slowly until reaching an equilibrium value (green curve in the central graph of Fig. 5-12). At this point, internal and external glucose concentrations are identical. The slow increase in intravesicular [glucose] occurs by diffusion in the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In contrast, adding $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the external medium establishes a steep inwardly directed Na gradient, which dramatically accelerates glucose uptake (red curve in the central graph of Fig. 5-12). The result is a transient "overshoot" during which glucose
accumulates above the equilibrium level. Thus, in the presence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the vesicle clearly transports glucose uphill. Similar gradients of other cations, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, have no effect on glucose movement beyond that expected from diffusion alone.
A negative cell voltage can also drive Na/glucose cotransport, even when there is no $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient. In experiments in which the internal and external $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations are the same, making the inside of the vesicles electrically negative accelerates glucose uptake (not shown in Fig. 5-12).

In vesicle experiments performed on vesicles made from the basolateral membrane, the overshoot in intravesicular [glucose] does not occur, even in the presence of an inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient. Thus, the Na/glucose cotransporter is restricted to the apical membrane.

$\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ Cotransporter The second type of cation-coupled $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$cotransporter is found in the apical membrane of the early distal tubule of the kidney (see p. 758). This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$independent $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NCC or SLC12A3) is blocked by thiazide diuretics rather than by loop diuretics (see Fig. 5-11H). For this reason, NCC has also been called the thiazide-sensitive cotransporter (TSC).

K/Cl Cotransporter The third type of cation-coupled $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ cotransporter is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (KCC) family (KCC1 to KCC4 or SLC12A4 to SLC12A7). Because the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump causes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to accumulate inside the cell, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$electrochemical gradient is outwardly directed across the plasma membrane (see Fig. 5-11f). In addition, pathways such as the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter and the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ anion exchanger (see below) bring $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the cell, so that in most cells the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$electrochemical gradient is also outwardly directed. Thus, the net driving force acting on the KCC favors the exit of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from the cell (see pp. 131-132).

H+-Driven Cotransporters Although the majority of known cotransporters in animal cells are driven by the inward movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, some are instead driven by the downhill, inward movement of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The H/oligopeptide cotransporter PepT1 and related proteins are members of the SLC15 family. PepT1 is electrogenic and responsible for the uptake of small peptides (see Fig. 5-11f) from the lumen into the cells of the renal proximal tubule (see pp. 777-778) and small intestine (see p. 923). The $\mathbf{H}^{+}$-driven amino-acid cotransporters (e.g., PAT1) are members of the SLC36 family. The monocarboxylate cotransporters, such as MCT1, are members of the SLC16 family. They mediate the electroneutral, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-coupled flux of lactate, pyruvate, or other monocarboxylates across the cell membranes of most tissues in the body (see Fig. 5-11K). In the case of lactate, MCT1 can operate in either the net inward or net outward direction, depending on the lactate and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradients across the cell membrane. MCT1 probably moves lactate out of cells that produce lactate by glycolysis but into cells that consume lactate. The divalent metal-ion cotransporter (DMT1), a member of the SLC11 family, couples the influx of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the influx of ferrous iron $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$ as well as to the influx of a variety of other divalent metals, some of which $\left(\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}, \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}\right)$ are toxic to cells (see Fig. 5-11L). DMT1 is expressed at high levels in the kidney and proximal portions of the small intestine.

## Exchangers, another class of secondary active transporters, exchange ions for one another

The other major class of secondary active transporters is the exchangers, or antiporters. Exchangers are intrinsic membrane proteins that move one or more "driving" solutes in one direction and one or more "driven" solutes in the opposite direction. In general, these transporters exchange cations for cations or anions for anions.

Na-Ca Exchanger The nearly ubiquitous Na-Ca exchangers (NCXs) belong to the SLC8 family (see Table 5-4). They most likely mediate the exchange of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions per $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$

ion (Fig. 5-13A). NCX is electrogenic and moves net positive charge in the same direction as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Under most circumstances, the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane drives the uphill extrusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell. Thus, in concert with the plasmamembrane Ca pump, this transport system helps maintain the steep, inwardly directed electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that is normally present across the plasma membrane of all cells.

NCX uses the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient to drive the secondary active efflux of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. With a presumed stoichiometry of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$per $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the effectiveness of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient as a driving force is magnified; thus, NCX is at equilibrium when the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ electrochemical gradient is balanced by three times the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient:

$$
\Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{Ca}}=3 \Delta \tilde{\mu}_{\mathrm{Na}}
$$

Alternatively,

$$
\frac{\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}=\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)^{3} \cdot 10^{-V_{\mathrm{m}} / 60 \mathrm{mV}}
$$

difference for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$can buy a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration gradient of $10^{3} \times 10^{1}$, or 10,000 -fold, which is the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ gradient across most cell membranes. Thus, the effect of the 10 -fold inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration gradient is cubed and can account for a $10^{3}$-fold $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration gradient across the plasma membrane. In addition, the stoichiometry of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$per $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ produces a net inflow of one positive charge per transport cycle. Thus, the $60-\mathrm{mV}$ inside-negative $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ acts as the equivalent driving force to another 10 -fold concentration gradient.

Na-H Exchanger The Na-H exchangers (NHEs), which belong to the SLC9 family (see Table 5-4), mediate the 1:1 exchange of extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$for intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the plasma membrane (see Fig. 5-13B). One or more of the nine (5) N5-20 known NHEs are present on the plasma membrane of almost every cell in the body. Through operation of NHEs, the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient drives the uphill extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cell and raises $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. The ubiquitous NHE1, which is present in nonepithelial cells as well as on the basolateral membranes of epithelia, plays a major role in pH , regulation (see p. 127) and cell volume (see p. 131). NHE3 is present at the apical membranes of several epithelia, where it plays a major role in acid secretion (see p. 827) and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption.

Another cation exchanger-the multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter (MATE; SLC47 family)-mediates the uptake of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the apical membrane of renal proximal tubule cells and hepatocytes in exchange for organic cations, which MATE secretes into the lumen.
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-Driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Exchanger A second $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled exchanger that is important for pH , regulation is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (NDCBE), a member of the SLC4 family (see Table 5-4). This electroneutral transporter couples the movement of one $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion and the equivalent of two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions (5) N5-19 in one direction to the movement of one $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion in the opposite direction (see Fig. 5-13C). NDCBE uses the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient to drive the uphill entry of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the cell. Thus, like the Na-H exchangers, NDCBE helps keep pH , relatively alkaline. NDCBE may also participate in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (i.e., movement from lumen to blood) across certain tubule cells in the kidney.

CI- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Exchanger A third group of exchangers that are involved in acid-base transport are the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers (see Fig. 5-13D) that function independently of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. These may be members of either the SLC4 or the SLC26 families. Virtually all cells in the body express one of the three electroneutral SLC4 or $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers, also known as anion exchangers (AE1 to AE3). AE1 is important for transporting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the red blood cell in the lung and out of the red blood cell in peripheral tissues (see p. 656). In other cells, where the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$gradient almost always drives $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out of the cell, AE2 and AE3 play important roles in pH , regulation (see p. 127) by tending to acidify the cell. Moreover, the uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$often plays a role in the regulation of cell volume (see p. 130).

Several members of the SLC26 family can function as $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers and thereby play important roles in

epithelial $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transport. Because the stoichiometry need not be $1: 1, \mathrm{SLC} 26$ transport can be electrogenic. As described next, even SLC26 proteins that exchange $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$also transport a wide variety of other anions.

Other Anion Exchangers A characteristic of the SLC26 family is their multifunctionality. For example, SLC26A6present in the apical membranes of renal proximal tubule cells-can mediate Cl-formate exchange and Cl-oxalate exchange (see Fig. 5-13E). These activities appear to be important for the secondary active uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and for secretion of oxalate. Pendrin not only mediates $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange but may also transport $\mathrm{I}^{-}$, which may be important in the thyroid gland (see p. 1006).

Anion exchangers other than those in the SLC4 and SLC26 families also play important roles. The organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are members of the SLC21 family. In the liver, OATPs mediate the uptake of bile acids, bilirubin, and the test substrate bromsulphthalein. Another member of the SLC21 family is the prostaglandin transporter (PGT), which mediates the uptake of prostanoids (e.g., prostaglandins $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{F}_{2 \alpha}$ and thromboxane $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ ).

The organic anion transporters (OATs) are members of the diverse SLC22 family. The OATs-by exchange or facilitated diffusion-mediate the uptake of endogenous organic anions (see Fig. 5-13F), as well as drugs, including penicillin and the test substrate $p$-aminohippurate. URAT1, another SLC22 member, is an exchanger that mediates urate transport in the renal proximal tubule. Surprisingly, the OCT
transporters that mediate the facilitated diffusion of organic cations (see p. 115) are also members of SLC22.

## REGULATION OF INTRACELLULAR ION CONCENTRATIONS

Figure 5-14 illustrates the tools at the disposal of a prototypic cell for managing its intracellular composition. Cells in different tissues-and even different cell types within the same tissue-have different complements of channels and transporters. Epithelial cells and neurons may segregate specific channels and transporters to different parts of the cell (e.g., apical versus basolateral membrane or axon versus soma/ dendrite). Thus, different cells may have somewhat different intracellular ionic compositions.

## The Na-K pump keeps [ $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$] inside the cell low and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$high

The most striking and important gradients across the cell membrane are those for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Sodium is the predominant cation in ECF, where it is present at a concentration of $\sim 145 \mathrm{mM}$ (see Fig. 5-14). $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is relatively excluded from the intracellular space, where it is present at only a fraction of the extracellular concentration. This $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient is maintained primarily by active extrusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the cell by the Na-K pump (see Fig. 5-14, No. 1). In contrast, potassium is present at a concentration of only $\sim 4.5 \mathrm{mM}$ in ECF, but it is the predominant cation in the intracellular

space, where it is accumulated $\sim 25-$ to 30 -fold above the outside concentration. Again, this gradient is the direct result of primary active uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the cell by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. When the Na-K pump is inhibited with ouabain, $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, rises and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, falls.

In addition to generating concentration gradients for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump plays an important role in generating the inside-negative membrane voltage, which is $\sim 60 \mathrm{mV}$ in a typical cell. The $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump accomplishes this task in two ways. First, because the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump transports three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions out of the cell for every two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions, the pump itself is electrogenic. This electrogenicity causes a net outward current of positive charge across the plasma membrane and tends to generate an insidenegative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. However, the pump current itself usually makes only a small contribution to the negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Second, and quantitatively much more important, the active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ accumulation by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump creates a concentration gradient that favors the exit of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the cell through $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 5-14, No. 2). The tendency of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to exit through these channels, with unmatched negative charges left behind, is the main cause of the inside-negative membrane voltage. When $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are blocked with an inhibitor such as $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}, V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes considerably less negative (i.e., the cell depolarizes). In most cells, the principal pathway for current flow across the plasma membrane (i.e., the principal ionic conductance) is through $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. We discuss the generation of membrane voltage in Chapter 6.

The inside-negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, together with the large concentration gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, summates to create a large, inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient that strongly favors passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry. Given the large amount of energy that is devoted to generation of this favorable driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ entry, one might expect that the cell would permit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to move into the cell only through pathways serving important physiological purposes. The simple passive entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ through channels-without harnessing of this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry for some physiological purpose-would complete a futile cycle that culminates in active $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion. It would make little teleological sense for the cell to use up considerable energy stores to extrude $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$only to let it passively diffuse back in with no effect. Rather, cells harness the energy of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry for three major purposes:

1. In certain epithelial cells, amiloride-sensitive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (ENaCs) are largely restricted to the apical or luminal surface of the cell (see Fig. 5-14, No. 3), and the Na-K pumps are restricted to the basolateral surface of the cell. In this way, transepithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport takes place rather than a futile cycling of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$back and forth across a single plasma membrane.
2. In excitable cells, passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry occurs through voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 5-14, No. 4) and plays a critical role in generation of the action potential. In such cells, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is cycled at high energy cost across the plasma membrane for the important physiological purpose of information transfer.
3. Virtually every cell in the body uses the electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the plasma membrane to drive the secondary active transport of nutrients and ions (see Fig. $5-14$, No. 5).

## The Ca pump and the Na-Ca exchanger keep intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ four orders of magnitude lower than extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$

Whereas the concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the extracellular space is $\sim 1 \mathrm{mM}\left(10^{-3} \mathrm{M}\right)$, that in the ICF is only $\sim 100 \mathrm{nM}\left(10^{-7} \mathrm{M}\right)$, a concentration gradient of $10^{4}$-fold. Because of the insidenegative membrane voltage of a typical cell and the large chemical gradient for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the inwardly directed electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the plasma membrane is enormous, far larger than that for any other ion. Many cells have a variety of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels through which $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can enter the cell (see Fig. 5-14, No. 6). In general, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are gated by voltage (see pp. 189-190) or by humoral agents (see pp. 323-324) so that rapid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry into the cell occurs only in short bursts. However, given the existence of pathways for passive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transport into cells, we may ask what transport mechanisms keep $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, low and thus maintain the enormous $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane.

Ca Pump (SERCA) in Organelle Membranes Ca pumps (ATPases) are present on the membranes that surround various intracellular organelles, such as the sacroplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum (see Fig. 5-14, No. 7). These pumps actively sequester cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in intracellular stores. These stores of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can later be released into the cytoplasm in bursts as part of a signal-transduction process in response to membrane depolarization or humoral agents. Even though $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sequestration in intracellular stores is an important mechanism for regulating $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, in the short term, there is a limit to how much $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ a cell can store. Therefore, in the steady state, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion across the cell membrane must balance the passive influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

Ca Pump (PMCA) on the Plasma Membrane The plasma membranes of most cells contain a Ca pump that plays a major role in extruding $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell (see Fig. 5-14, No. 8). It would seem that rising levels of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ would stimulate the Ca pump to extrude $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and thereby return $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, toward normal. Actually, the pump itself is incapable of this type of feedback control; because it has such a high $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, the pump is virtually inactive at physiological $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. However, as $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to a protein known as calmodulin (CaM; see p. 60), which has a high affinity for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The newly formed $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ binds to the Ca pump, lowers the pump's $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ into the physiological range, and thus stimulates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion. As $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ falls, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ levels inside the cell also fall, so that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ CaM dissociates from the Ca pump and the pump is thereby returned to its inactive state. At resting $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ levels of $\sim 100$ nM , the Ca pump is the major route of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion.

Na-Ca Exchanger (NCX) on the Plasma Membrane The Na-Ca exchanger (see Fig. 5-14, No. 9) plays a key role in extruding $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ only when $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises substantially above normal levels. Thus, NCX is especially important in restoring low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, when large influxes of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ occur. This property is most notable in excitable cells such as neurons and cardiac muscle, which may be challenged with vast $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influxes through voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels during action potentials.

## In most cells, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$is modestly above equilibrium because $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake by the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger and $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter balances passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$efflux through channels

The $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$in all cells is below the $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$in the extracellular space. Virtually all cells have anion-selective channels (see Fig. 5-14, No. 10) through which $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$can permeate passively. In a typical cell with a $60-\mathrm{mV}$ inside-negative membrane voltage, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, would be a tenth that of $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{o}$ if $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ were passively distributed across the plasma membrane. Such is the case for skeletal muscle. However, for most cell types, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ is approximately twice as high as that predicted for passive distribution alone, which indicates the presence of transport pathways that mediate the active uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ into the cell. Probably the most common pathway for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ uptake is the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see Fig. 5-14, No. 11). Because $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{o}$ is several-fold higher than if it were passively distributed across the cell membrane, the outwardly directed electrochemical potential energy difference for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can act as a driving force for the uphill entry of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ through $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange. Another pathway that can mediate uphill $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transport into the cell is the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (see Fig. 5-14, No. 12), which is stimulated by low $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$.

Given the presence of these transport pathways mediating $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake, why is $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ only $\sim 2$-fold above that predicted for passive distribution? The answer is that the passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ efflux through anion-selective channels in the plasma membrane opposes $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake mechanisms. Another factor that tends to keep $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$low in some cells is the $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter. This KCC (see Fig. 5-14, No. 13), driven by the outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradient, tends to move $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$out of cells. Thus, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradient promotes $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$efflux both by generating the insidenegative $V_{m}$ that drives $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$out of the cell through channels and by driving $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport.

## The Na-H exchanger and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters keep the intracellular pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$above their equilibrium values

$\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ within a particular compartment are generally in equilibrium with one another. Extracellular pH is normally $\sim 7.4,\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{0}$ is 24 mM , and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In a typical cell, intracellular pH is $\sim 7.2$. Because $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ is usually the same on both sides of the cell membrane, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{i}$ can be calculated to be $\sim 15 \mathrm{mM}$. Even though the ICF is slightly more acidic than the ECF, $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is actually much more alkaline than it would be if $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$were passively distributed across the cell membrane. $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can enter the cell passively and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can exit the cell passively, although both processes occur at a rather low rate. $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can permeate certain cation channels and perhaps $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-selective channels (see Fig. 5-14, No. 14), and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$moves fairly easily through most $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels (see Fig. 5-14, No. 15). Because a membrane voltage of -60 mV is equivalent as a driving force to a 10 -fold concentration gradient of a monovalent ion, one would expect $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$to be 10 -fold higher within the cell than in the ECF, which corresponds to a pH , that is 1 pH unit more acidic than $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$. Similarly, one would expect $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{i}$ to be only one tenth of $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{o}$. The observation that $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and
$\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{i}$ are maintained higher than predicted for passive distribution across the plasma membrane indicates that cells must actively extrude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or take up $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

The transport of acid out of the cell or base into the cell is collectively termed acid extrusion. In most cells, the acid extruders are secondary active transporters that are energized by the electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the cell membrane. The most important acid extruders are the Na-H (see Fig. 5-14, No. 16) and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers (see Fig. 5-14, No. 17), as well as the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometries of $1: 2$ and $1: 1$ (see Fig. 5-11E, F). These transport systems are generally sensitive to changes in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$, they are stimulated when the cell is acidified and inhibited when the cell is alkalinized. Thus, these transporters maintain $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ in a range that is optimal for cell functioning. Less commonly, certain epithelial cells that are specialized for acid secretion use V-type H pumps (see Fig. 5-14, No. 18) or H-K pumps on their apical membranes to extrude acid. These epithelia include the renal collecting duct and the stomach. As noted above, virtually all cells have V-type H pumps on the membranes surrounding such intracellular organelles as lysosomes, endosomes, and Golgi.

Because most cells have powerful acid-extrusion systems, one might ask why the $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is not far more alkaline than $\sim 7.2$. Part of the answer is that transport processes that act as acid loaders balance acid extrusion. Passive leakage of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$through channels, as noted above, tends to acidify the cell. Cells also have transporters that generally move $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ out of cells. The most common is the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see Fig. 5-14, No. 11). Another is the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter with an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of $1: 3$ (see Fig. 5-14, No. 19), which moves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out of the cell across the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubules.

## WATER TRANSPORT AND THE REGULATION OF CELL VOLUME

## Water transport is driven by osmotic and hydrostatic pressure differences across membranes

Transport of water across biological membranes is always passive. $\mathrm{No} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pumps have ever been described. (T) N5-21 To a certain extent, single $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules can dissolve in lipid bilayers and thus move across cell membranes at a low but finite rate by simple diffusion. The ease with which $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ diffuses through the lipid bilayer depends on the lipid composition of the bilayer. Membranes with low fluidity (see p. 10)-that is, those whose phospholipids have long saturated fatty-acid chains with few double bonds (i.e., few kinks)-exhibit lower $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability. The addition of other lipids that decrease fluidity (e.g., cholesterol) may further reduce $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability. Therefore, it is not surprising that the plasma membranes of many types of cells have specialized $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ channels-the AQPs-that serve as passive conduits for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport. The presence of AQPs greatly increases membrane $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability. In some cells, such as erythrocytes or the renal proximal tubule, AQP1 is always present in the membrane. The collectingduct cells of the kidney regulate the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability of their apical membranes by inserting AQP2 $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ channels

into their apical membranes under the control of arginine vasopressin.

Water transport across a membrane is always a linear, nonsaturable function of its net driving force. The direction of net passive transport of an uncharged solute is always down its chemical potential energy difference. For $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, we must consider two passive driving forces. The first is the familiar chemical potential energy difference $\left(\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$, which depends on the difference in water concentration on the two sides of the membrane. The second is the energy difference, per mole of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, that results from the difference in hydrostatic pressure ( $\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { pressure }}$ ) across the membrane. Thus, the relevant energy difference across the membrane is the sum of the chemical and pressure potential energy differences:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { total }}=\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}+\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { pressure }} \\
& \Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { total }}=\underbrace{R T}_{\text {Total energy difference }} \underbrace{\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]_{\mathrm{io}}}}_{\text {Chemical part }}+\underbrace{\bar{V}_{\mathrm{W}}\left(P_{\mathrm{i}}-P_{\mathrm{ir}}\right)}_{\text {Pressure part }} .
\end{aligned}
$$

$P$ is the hydrostatic pressure and $\bar{V}_{\mathrm{W}}$ is the partial molar volume of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (i.e., volume occupied by 1 mole of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). Because the product of pressure and volume is work, the second term in Equation 5-23 is work per mole. Dealing with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ concentrations is cumbersome and imprecise because $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$ is very high (i.e., $\sim 56 \mathrm{M}$ ) and does not change substantially in the dilute solutions that physiologists are interested in. Therefore, it is more practical to work with the inverse of $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$, namely, the concentration of osmotically active solutes, or osmolality. (5-21) The units of osmolality are osmoles per kilogram of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, or Osm. In dilute solutions, the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ gradient across the cell membrane is roughly proportional to the difference in osmolalities across the membrane:

$$
\ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}} \cong \bar{V}_{\mathrm{W}}\left(\text { Osm }_{o}-\text { Osm }_{\mathrm{i}}\right)
$$

where Osm is the total concentration of all osmotically active solutes in the indicated compartment (e.g., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+$ $\mathrm{K}^{+}+\ldots$ ). Substituting Equation 5-24 into Equation 5-23 yields a more useful expression for the total energy difference across the membrane:

$$
\underbrace{\frac{\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { total }}}{\frac{\text { Energy }}{\text { mole }}}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Volume } \\
\text { mole }
\end{array}} \underbrace{\left[R T\left(O s m_{o}-\text { Osm }_{\mathrm{i}}\right)+\left(P_{\mathrm{i}}-P_{\mathrm{o}}\right)\right]}_{\text {Pressure }}
$$

In this equation, the terms inside the brackets have the units of pressure (force per area) and thus describe the driving force for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement from the inside to the outside of the cell. This driving force determines the flux of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across the membrane:

$$
J_{\mathrm{V}}=L_{\mathrm{p}}\left[R T\left(O s m_{o}-\text { Osm }_{\mathrm{i}}\right)+\left(P_{\mathrm{i}}-P_{\mathrm{o}}\right)\right]
$$

$J_{\mathrm{V}}$ is positive when $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ flows out of the cell and has the units of $\mathrm{L} /\left(\mathrm{cm}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}\right)$. The proportionality constant $L_{\mathrm{p}}$ is the hydraulic conductivity.

Water is in equilibrium across the membrane when the net driving force for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport is nil. If we set $\Delta \mu_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \text { total }}$ to zero in Equation 5-25:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& R T\left(O s m_{\mathrm{i}}-\text { Osm }_{o}\right)=\left(P_{\mathrm{i}}-P_{\mathrm{o}}\right) \\
& \begin{array}{c}
\left(\pi_{\mathrm{i}}-\pi_{\mathrm{o}}\right) \\
\text { Osmotic } \\
\text { pressure difference } \\
\Delta \pi
\end{array}=\begin{array}{c}
\left(P_{\mathrm{i}}-P_{\mathrm{o}}\right) \\
\text { Hydrostatic pressure } \\
\text { difference } \\
\text { $\Delta P
\end{array}
\end{aligned}
$$

The term on the left is referred to as the osmotic pressure difference $(\Delta \pi)$. Thus, at equilibrium the osmotic pressure difference is equal to the hydrostatic pressure difference $(\Delta P)$. An osmotic pressure difference of 1 milliosmole $/ \mathrm{kg}$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (or 1 mOsm ) is equivalent to a hydrostatic pressure difference of 19.3 mm Hg at normal body temperature.

The plasma membranes of animal cells are not rigid (unlike the walls of plant cells) and cannot tolerate any significant hydrostatic pressure difference without deforming. Therefore, the hydrostatic pressure difference across a cell membrane is virtually always near zero and is therefore not a significant driving force for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport.

Movement of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in and out of cells is driven by osmotic gradients only, that is, by differences in osmolality across the membrane. For example, if the osmolality is greater outside the cell than inside, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will flow out of the cell and the cell will shrink. Such a movement of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ driven by osmotic gradients is called osmosis. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is at equilibrium across cell membranes only when the osmolality inside and outside the cell is the same.

Hydrostatic pressure differences are an important force for driving fluid out across the walls of capillaries (see p. 468). Small solutes permeate freely across most capillaries. Thus, any difference in osmotic pressure as a result of these small solutes does not exert a driving force for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ flow across that capillary. The situation is quite different for plasma proteins, which are too large to penetrate the capillary wall freely. As a result, the presence of a greater concentration of plasma proteins in the intravascular compartment than in interstitial fluid sets up a difference in osmotic pressure that tends to pull fluid back into the capillary. This difference is called the colloid osmotic pressure or oncotic pressure. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is at equilibrium across the wall of a capillary when the colloid osmotic and hydrostatic pressure differences are equal. When the hydrostatic pressure difference exceeds the colloid osmotic pressure difference, the result is movement of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ out of the capillary, called ultrafiltration.

## Because of the presence of impermeant, negatively charged proteins within the cell, Donnan forces will lead to cell swelling

NaCl , the most abundant salt in ECF , is largely excluded from the intracellular compartment by the direct and indirect actions of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. This relative exclusion of NaCl from the intracellular space is vital for maintaining normal cell $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content (i.e., cell volume). In the absence of $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps, cells tend to swell even when both the intracellular and extracellular osmolalities are normal and identical. This statement may appear to contradict the principle that there can be no $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ flux without a difference in osmolality across the cell membrane (see Equation 5-26). To

Figure 5-15 Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium. A semipermeable membrane separates two compartments that have rigid walls and equal volumes. The membrane is permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and water, but not to the macromolecule Y , which carries 150 negative charges. The calculations of $\psi$, and $P$ assume a temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
understand this apparent paradox, consider a simplified model that illustrates the key role played by negatively charged, impermeant macromolecules (i.e., proteins) inside the cell (Fig. 5-15).

Imagine that a semipermeable membrane separates a left compartment (analogous to the extracellular space) and a right compartment (analogous to the intracellular space). The two compartments are rigid and have equal volumes throughout the experiment. The right compartment is fitted with a pressure gauge. The membrane is nondeformable and permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, but it is not permeable to a negatively charged macromolecule (Y). For the sake of simplicity, assume that each Y carries 150 negative charges and is restricted to the intracellular solution. Figure 5-15A illustrates the ionic conditions at the beginning of the experiment. At this initial condition, the system is far out of equilibrium; although $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is the same on both sides of the membrane, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Y}^{-150}\right]$ have opposing concentration gradients of 150 mM .

What will happen now? The system will tend toward equilibrium. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$will move down its concentration gradient into the cell. This entry of negatively charged particles will generate an inside-negative membrane voltage, which in turn will attract $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and cause $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to move into the cell. In the final equilibrium condition, both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$will be distributed
so that the concentration of each is balanced against the same $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, which is given by the Nernst equation (Equation 5-8):

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V_{\mathrm{m}}=-\frac{R T}{F} \ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}} \\
& V_{\mathrm{m}}=-\frac{R T}{(-1) F} \ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ must be the same in the two cases, we combine the two equations, obtaining

$$
\begin{gathered}
-\ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}=\ln \frac{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}} \\
\frac{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}=r
\end{gathered}
$$

where $r$ is the Donnan ratio because this equilibrium state is a Gibbs-Donnan equilibrium (often shortened to Donnan equilibrium). All the values for ionic concentrations in Equation 5-30 are new values. As $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entered the cell, not only did $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, rise but $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$, also fell, by identical amounts. The same is true for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. How much did the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ concentrations have to change before the system achieved equilibrium? An important constraint on the system as it approaches equilibrium is that in each compartment, the total number of positive charges must balance the total number of negative charges (bulk electroneutrality) at all times. Imagine an intermediate state, between the initial condition and the final equilibrium state, in which 10 mM of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and 10 mM of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$have moved into the cell (see Fig. 5-15B). This condition is still far from equilibrium because the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ratio in Equation 5-30 is 0.875 , whereas the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ratio is only 0.071 ; thus, these ratios are not equal. Therefore, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$continue to move into the cell until the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ratio and the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ratio are both 0.5 , the Donnan $r$ ratio (see Fig. 5-15C). This final ratio corresponds to Nernst potentials of -18.4 mV for both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

However, although the ions are in equilibrium, far more osmotically active particles are now on the inside than on the outside. Ignoring the osmotic effect of $\mathrm{Y}^{-150}$, the sum of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$on the inside is 250 mM , whereas it is only 200 mM on the outside. Because of this $50-\mathrm{mOsm}$ gradient ( $\Delta \mathrm{Osm}$ ) across the membrane, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ cannot be at equilibrium and will therefore move into the cell. In our example, the right (inside) compartment is surrounded by a rigid wall so that only a minuscule amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ needs to enter the cell to generate a hydrostatic pressure of 967 mm Hg to oppose the additional net entry of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This equilibrium hydrostatic pressure difference $(\Delta P)$ opposes the osmotic pressure difference $(\Delta \pi)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta P & =\Delta \pi \\
& =R T \Delta \mathrm{Osm} \\
& =R T\left[\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}\right)-\left(\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}\right)\right] \\
& =R T(50 \mathrm{mM}) \\
& =967 \mathrm{mmHg} \\
& =1.3 \mathrm{~atm}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, in the rigid "cell" of our example, achieving GibbsDonnan equilibrium would require developing within the model cell a hydrostatic pressure that is 1.3 atm greater than the pressure in the left compartment (outside).

## The Na-K pump maintains cell volume by doing osmotic work that counteracts the passive Donnan forces

Unlike in the preceding example, the plasma membranes of animal cells are not rigid but deformable, so that transmembrane hydrostatic pressure gradients cannot exist. Thus, in animal cells, the distribution of ions toward the Donnan equilibrium condition would, it appears, inevitably lead to progressive water entry, cell swelling, and, ultimately, bursting. Although the Donnan equilibrium model is artificial (e.g., it ignores all ions other than $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{Y}^{-150}$ ), it nevertheless illustrates a point that is important for real cells: the negative charge on impermeant intracellular solutes (e.g., proteins and organic phosphates) will lead to bursting unless the cell does "osmotic work" to counteract the passive Donnan-like swelling. The net effect of this osmotic work is to largely exclude NaCl from the cell and thereby make the cell functionally impermeable to NaCl . In a sense, NaCl acts as a functionally impermeant solute in the extracellular space that offsets the osmotic effects of intracellular negative charges. This state of affairs is not an equilibrium but a steady state maintained by active transport.

As an illustration of the role of active transport, consider a somewhat more realistic model of a cell (Fig. 5-16). Under "normal" conditions, $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i},\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$, and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ are constant because (1) the active extrusion of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in exchange for two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions is balanced by the passive influx of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions and the passive efflux of two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions, and (2) the net flux of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is zero (i.e., we assume that $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is in equilibrium). When the Na-K pump is inhibited, the passive entry of three
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions exceeds the net passive efflux of two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions and thereby results in a gain of one intracellular cation and an immediate small depolarization (i.e., the cell becomes less negative inside). In addition, as intracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$slowly declines after inhibition of the Na-K pump, the cell depolarizes even further because the outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient is the predominant determinant of the membrane voltage. The inside-negative $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ is the driving force that is largely responsible for excluding $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from the cell, and depolarization of the cell causes $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to enter through anion channels. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$influx results in the gain of one intracellular anion. The net gain of one intracellular cation and one anion increases the number of osmotically active particles and in so doing creates the inward osmotic gradient that leads to cell swelling. Thus, in the normal environment in which cells are bathed, the action of the Na-K pump is required to prevent the cell swelling that would otherwise occur.

A real cell, of course, is far more complex than the idealized cell in Figure 5-16, having myriad interrelated channels and transporters (see Fig. 5-14). These other pathways, together with the Na-K pump, have the net effect of excluding NaCl and other solutes from the cell. Because the solute gradients that drive transport through these other pathways ultimately depend on the Na-K pump, inhibiting the Na-K pump will de-energize these other pathways and lead to cell swelling.

## Cell volume changes trigger rapid changes in ion channels or transporters, returning volume toward normal

The joint efforts of the Na-K pump and other transport pathways are necessary for maintaining normal cell volume. What happens if cell volume is acutely challenged? A subset of "other pathways" respond to the cell volume change by

transferring solutes across the membrane, thereby returning the volume toward normal.

Response to Cell Shrinkage If we increase extracellular osmolality by adding an impermeant solute such as mannitol (Fig. 5-17A), the extracellular solution becomes hyperosmolal and exerts an osmotic force that draws $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ out of the cell. The cell continues to shrink until the osmolality inside and out becomes the same. Many types of cells respond to this shrinkage by activating solute uptake processes to increase cell solute and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content. This response is known as a regulatory volume increase (RVI). Depending on the cell type, cell shrinkage activates different types of solute uptake mechanisms. In many types of cells, shrinkage activates the ubiquitous NHE1 isoform of the Na-H exchanger. In addition to mediating increased uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$alkalinizes the cell and consequently activates $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$
exchange. The initial net effect is the entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. However, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump then extrudes the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, so that the final net effect is the gain of intracellular KCl . The resulting increase in intracellular osmoles then draws $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the cell to restore cell volume toward normal. Alternatively, the RVI response may be mediated by activation of the NKCC1 isoform of the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter.

Response to Cell Swelling If extracellular osmolality is decreased by the addition of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 5-17B), the extracellular solution becomes hypo-osmolal and exerts a lesser osmotic force so that $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ moves into the cell. The cell continues to swell until the osmolality inside and out becomes the same. Many cell types respond to this swelling by activating solute efflux pathways to decrease cell solute and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content and thereby return cell volume toward normal. This response is known as a regulatory volume decrease (RVD).

## BOX 5-1 Disorders of Extracellular Osmolality

Pegulatory adjustments in cell volume can be extremely important clinically. In major disorders of extracellular osmolality, the principal signs and symptoms arise from abnormal brain function, which can be fatal. For example, it is all too common for the elderly or infirm, unable to maintain proper fluid intake because of excessive heat or disability, to be brought to the emergency department in a state of severe dehydration. The hyperosmolality that results from dehydration can lead to brain shrinkage, which in extreme cases can cause intracerebral hemorrhage from tearing of blood vessels. If the brain cells compensate for this hyperosmolality by the long-term mechanisms discussed (e.g., manufacturing of idiogenic osmoles), cell shrinkage may be minimized. However, consider the consequence if an unsuspecting physician, unaware of the nuances of cell volume regulation, rapidly corrects the elevated extracellular hyperosmolality back down to normal. Rapid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ entry into the brain cells will cause cerebral edema (i.e., brain swelling) and may result in death from herniation of the brainstem through the tentorium. For this reason, severe disturbances in ECF osmolality must usually be corrected slowly.

Depending on the cell type, swelling activates different types of solute efflux mechanisms. In many types of cells, swelling activates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (or both). Because the electrochemical gradients for these two ions are generally directed outward across the plasma membrane, activating these channels causes a net efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, which lowers the intracellular solute content and causes $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to flow out of the cell. The result is restoration of cell volume toward normal. Alternatively, the RVD response may be initiated by activating the $K / C l$ cotransporter.

In the normal steady state, the transport mechanisms that are responsible for RVI and RVD are usually not fully quiescent. Not only does cell shrinkage activate the transport pathways involved in RVI (i.e., solute loaders), it also appears to inhibit at least some of the transport pathways involved in RVD (i.e., solute extruders). The opposite is true of cell swelling. In all cases, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump ultimately generates the ion gradients driving the movements of NaCl and KCl that regulate cell volume in response to changes in extracellular osmolality (Box 5-1).

## Cells respond to long-term hyperosmolality by accumulating new intracellular organic solutes

Whereas the acute response (seconds to minutes) to hyperosmolality (i.e., RVI) involves the uptake of salts, long-term adaptation (hours to days) to hyperosmolality involves accumulation of organic solutes (osmolytes) within the cell. Examples of such intracellularly accumulated osmolytes include two relatively impermeant alcohol derivatives of common sugars (i.e., sorbitol and inositol) as well as two amines (betaine and taurine). Generation of organic solutes (idiogenic osmoles) within the cell plays a major role in raising intracellular osmolality and restoring cell volume during long-term adaptation to hyperosmolality-a response that is particularly true in brain cells. Sorbitol is produced
from glucose by a reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme aldose reductase. Cell shrinkage is a powerful stimulus for the synthesis of aldose reductase.

In addition to synthesizing organic solutes, cells can also transport them into the cytosol from the outside. For example, cells use distinct $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransport systems to accumulate inositol, betaine, and taurine. In some types of cells, shrinkage induces greatly enhanced expression of these transporters, thereby leading to the accumulation of these intracellular solutes.

## The gradient in tonicity-or effective osmolality-determines the osmotic flow of water across a cell membrane

Total-body water (TBW) is distributed among blood plasma and the interstitial, intracellular, and transcellular fluids. The mechanisms by which $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ exchanges between interstitial fluid and ICF, and between interstitial fluid and plasma, rely on the principles that we have just discussed.

Water Exchange Across Cell Membranes Because cell membranes are not rigid, hydrostatic pressure differences never arise between cell $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and interstitial fluid. Increasing the hydrostatic pressure in the interstitial space will cause the cell to compress so that the intracellular hydrostatic pressure increases to a similar extent. Thus, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ does not enter the cell under these conditions. However, increasing the interstitial osmotic pressure, and thus generating a $\Delta \pi$, is quite a different matter. If we suddenly increase ECF osmolality by adding an impermeant solute such as mannitol, the resulting osmotic gradient across the cell membrane causes $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to move out of the cell. If the cell does not have an RVI mechanism or if the RVI mechanism is blocked, cell volume will remain reduced indefinitely.

On the other hand, consider what would happen if we suddenly increase ECF osmolality by adding a permeant solute such as urea. Urea can rapidly penetrate cell membranes by facilitated diffusion through members of the UT family of transporters; however, cells have no mechanism for extruding urea. Because urea penetrates the membrane more slowly than $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ does, the initial effect of applying urea is to shrink the cell (Fig. 5-18). However, as urea gradually equilibrates across the cell membrane and abolishes the initially imposed osmotic gradient, the cell reswells to its initial volume. Thus, sustained changes in cell volume do not occur with a change in the extracellular concentration of a permeant solute.

The difference between the effects of mannitol and urea on the final cell volume illustrates the need to distinguish between total osmolality and effective osmolality (also known as tonicity). In terms of clinically measured solutes, total and effective osmolality of the ECF can be approximated as

Total
osmolality $(\mathrm{mOsm}) \cong 2 \cdot\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]+\frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}{18}+\frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}{2.8}$
Tonicity or effective
osmolality $(\mathrm{mOsm}) \cong 2 \cdot\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]+\frac{\text {Glucose }(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})}{18}$

![bo1244543376c](bo1244543376c.jpg)

Figure 5-18 Effect of urea on the volume of a single cell bathed in an infinite volume of ECF. We assume that the cell membrane is permeable only to water during the initial moments in steps 2 and 3. Later, during steps 4 and 5 , we assume that the membrane is permeable to both water and urea.

BUN stands for blood urea nitrogen, that is, the concentration of the nitrogen that is contained in the plasma as urea. The clinical laboratory reports the value of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in Equation 5-32 in milliequivalents per liter. Because laboratories in the United States report the glucose and BUN concentrations in terms of milligrams per deciliter, we divide glucose by one tenth of the molecular weight of glucose and BUN by one tenth of the summed atomic weights of the two nitrogen atoms in urea. The computed tonicity does not include BUN because-as we saw above-urea easily equilibrates across most cell membranes. On the other hand, the computed tonicity includes both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose. It includes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is functionally impermeant owing to its extrusion by the Na-K pump. Tonicity includes glucose because this solute does not appreciably accumulate in most cells as a result of metabolism. In some clinical situations, the infusion of impermeant solutes, such as radiographic contrast agents or mannitol, can also contribute to tonicity of the ECF.

Osmolality describes the number of osmotically active solutes in a single solution. If we regard a plasma osmolality of 290 mOsm as being normal, solutions having an osmolality of 290 mOsm are isosmolal, solutions with osmolalities $>290 \mathrm{mOsm}$ are hyperosmolal, and those with osmolalities $<290 \mathrm{mOsm}$ are hypo-osmolal. On the other hand, when we use the terms isotonic, hypertonic, and hypotonic, we are comparing one solution with another solution (e.g., ICF) across a well-defined membrane (e.g., a cell membrane). A solution is isotonic when its effective osmolality is the same as that of the reference solution, which for our purposes is the ICF. A hypertonic solution is one that has a higher effective osmolality than the reference solution, and a hypotonic solution has a lower effective osmolality.

Shifts of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ between the intracellular and interstitial compartments result from alterations in effective ECF osmolality, or tonicity. Clinically, such changes in tonicity are usually caused by decreases in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in the plasma and ECF (hyponatremia), increases in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$(hypernatremia), or increases in glucose concentration (hyperglycemia). Changes in the concentration of a highly permeant solute such as urea, which accumulates in patients with kidney failure, have no effect on tonicity.

Water Exchange Across the Capillary Wall The barrier separating the blood plasma and interstitial compartmentsthe capillary wall-is, to a first approximation, freely permeable to solutes that are smaller than plasma proteins. Thus, the only net osmotic force that acts across the capillary wall is that caused by the asymmetric distribution of proteins in plasma versus interstitial fluid. Several terms may be used for the osmotic force that is generated by these impermeant plasma proteins, such as protein osmotic pressure, colloid osmotic pressure, and oncotic pressure. These terms are synonymous and can be represented by the symbol $\pi_{\text {onostic }}$. The oncotic pressure difference ( $\Delta \pi_{\text {onostic }}$ ), which tends to pull $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ from the interstitium to the plasma, is opposed by the hydrostatic pressure difference across the capillary wall $(\Delta P)$, which drives fluid from plasma into the interstitium. All net movements of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across the capillary wall are accompanied by the small solutes dissolved in this $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, at their ECF concentrations; that is, the pathways taken by the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across

the capillary wall are so large that small solutes are not sieved out.

To summarize, fluid shifts between plasma and the interstitium respond only to changes in the balance between $\Delta P$ and $\Delta \pi_{\text {mecric }}$. Small solutes such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, which freely cross the capillary wall, do not contribute significantly to osmotic driving forces across this barrier and move along with the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in which they are dissolved. We will return to this subject when we discuss capillary exchange of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, beginning on p. 467.

Adding isotonic saline, pure water, or pure NaCl to the ECF will increase ECF volume but will have divergent effects on ICF volume and ECF osmolality

Adding various combinations of NaCl and solute-free water to the ECF will alter the volume and composition of the body fluid compartments. Three examples illustrate the effects seen with intravenous therapy. In Figure 5-19A, we start with a TBW of 42 L ( $60 \%$ of a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person), subdivided into an ICF volume of 25 L ( $60 \%$ of TBW) and an ECF volume of

Figure 5-19 Effect on body fluid compartments of infusing different solutions.

17 L ( $40 \%$ of TBW). These numerical values are the same as those in Figure 5-1 and Table 5-1.

Infusion of Isotonic Saline Consider the case in which we infuse or ingest 1.5 L of isotonic saline, which is a $0.9 \%$ solution of NaCl in $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 5-19B). This solution has an effective osmolality of 290 mOsm in the ECF. This 1.5 L is initially distributed throughout the ECF and raises ECF volume by 1.5 L . Because the effective osmolality of the ECF is unaltered, no change occurs in the effective osmotic gradient across the cell membranes, and the added $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ moves neither into nor out of the ICF. This outcome is, of course, in accord with the definition of an isotonic solution. Thus, we see that adding isotonic saline to the body is an efficient way to expand the ECF without affecting the ICF. Similarly, if it were possible to remove isotonic saline from the body, we would see that this measure would efficiently contract the ECF and again have no effect on the ICF.

Infusion of "Solute-Free" Water Now consider a case in which we either ingest 1.5 L of pure $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or infuse 1.5 L of an isotonic (5\%) glucose solution (see Fig. 5-19C). Infusing the glucose solution intravenously is equivalent, in the long run, to infusing pure $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ because the glucose is metabolized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, with no solutes left behind in the ECF. Infusing pure $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ would be unwise inasmuch as it would cause the cells near the point of infusion to burst.

How do the effects of adding 1.5 L of pure $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ compare with those in the previous example? At first, the 1.5 L of pure $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will be rapidly distributed throughout the ECF and increase its volume from 17 to 18.5 L (see Fig. 5-19C, left side [Early]). This added $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will also dilute the preexisting solutes in the ECF, thereby lowering ECF osmolality to $290 \mathrm{mOsm} \times 17 / 18.5=266 \mathrm{mOsm}$. Because intracellular osmolality remains at 290 mOsm at this imaginary, intermediate stage, a large osmotic gradient is created that favors the entry of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ from the ECF into the ICF. Water will move into the ICF and consequently lower the osmolality of the ICF and simultaneously raise the osmolality of the ECF until osmotic equilibrium is restored (see Fig. 5-19C, right side [Final]). Because the added $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is distributed between the ICF and ECF according to the initial ICF/ECF ratio of $60 \% / 40 \%$, the final ECF volume is 17.6 L (i.e., 17 L expanded by $40 \%$ of 1.5 L ). Thus, infusion of solute-free $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is a relatively ineffective means of expanding the ECF. More of the added $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ has ended up intracellularly ( $60 \%$ of $1.5 \mathrm{~L}=0.9 \mathrm{~L}$ of expansion). The major effect of the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ has been to dilute the osmolality of body fluids. The initial total-body solute content was $290 \mathrm{mOsm} \times$ $42 \mathrm{~L}=12,180$ milliosmoles. This same solute has now been diluted in $42+1.5$ or 43.5 L , so the final osmolality is $12,180 / 43.5=280 \mathrm{mOsm}$.

Ingestion of Pure NaCl Salt The preceding two "experiments" illustrate two extremely important principles that govern fluid and electrolyte homeostasis; namely, that adding or removing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$will mainly affect ECF volume (see Fig. 5-19B), whereas adding or removing solute-free $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ will mainly affect the osmolality of body fluids (see Fig. 5-19C). The first point can be further appreciated
by considering a third case, one in which we add the same amount of NaCl that is contained in 1.5 L of isotonic (i.e., $0.9 \%$ ) saline: $1.5 \mathrm{~L} \times 290 \mathrm{mOsm}=435$ milliosmoles. However, we will not add any $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. At first, these 435 milliosmoles of NaCl will rapidly distribute throughout the 17 L of ECF and increase the osmolality of the ECF (see Fig. 5-19D, left side [Early]). The initial total osmolal content of the ECF was $290 \mathrm{mOsm} \times 17 \mathrm{~L}=4930$ milliosmoles. Because we added 435 milliosmoles, we now have 5365 milliosmoles in the ECF. Thus, the ECF osmolality is $5365 / 17=316 \mathrm{mOsm}$. The resulting hyperosmolality draws $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ out of the ICF into the ECF until osmotic equilibrium is re-established. What is the final osmolality? The total number of milliosmoles dissolved in TBW is the original 12,180 milliosmoles plus the added 435 milliosmoles, for a total of 12,615 milliosmoles. Because these milliosmoles are dissolved in 42 L of TBW, the final osmolality of the ICF and ECF is $12,615 / 42=300 \mathrm{mOsm}$. In the new equilibrium state, the ECF volume has increased by 0.9 L even though no $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at all was added to the body. Because the added ECF volume has come from the ICF, the ICF shrinks by 0.9 L . This example further illustrates the principle that the total-body content of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is the major determinant of ECF volume.

## Whole-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content determines ECF volume, whereas whole-body water content determines osmolality

Changes in ECF volume are important because they are accompanied by proportional changes in the volume of blood plasma, which in turn affects the adequacy with which the circulatory system can perfuse vital organs with blood (see pp. 554-555). The blood volume that is necessary to achieve adequate perfusion of key organs is sometimes referred to as the effective circulating volume. Because the body generally stabilizes osmolality, an increase in extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content will increase ECF volume:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\text { Extracellular } \mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {content }}{\text { millimoles }}=\underbrace{\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}_{\text {millimoles/liter }} \times \underbrace{\text { ECF volume }}_{\text {liters }} \\
& \quad=\underbrace{\left(\frac{\text { Osmolality }}{2}\right)}_{\text {liters }} \times \underbrace{\text { ECF volume }}_{\text {liters }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because cells contain very little $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$,extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content is nearly the same as total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content.

We will see in Chapter 40 how the body regulates effective circulating volume. Increases in effective circulating volume, which reflect increases in ECF volume or total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ content, stimulate the renal excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In contrast, the plasma $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration does not regulate renal excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. It makes sense that regulation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion is not sensitive to the plasma $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration because the concentration is not an indicator of ECF volume.

As discussed, when we hold osmolality constant, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ content determines ECF volume. What would happen if we held constant the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content, which is a major part of total-body osmoles? An increase in TBW would decrease osmolality. (5) N5-2

![bo1284543376c](bo1284543376c.jpg)

Thus, a net gain or loss of solute-free $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ has a major impact on the osmolality and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$of the ECF. Moreover, because a large part ( $\sim 60 \%$ ) of the added solute-free water distributes into the ICF, a gain or loss of solute-free $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ affects ICF more than ECF. We will see beginning on p. 844 how the body regulates osmolality: a small decrease in osmolality triggers osmoreceptors to diminish thirst (which results in diminished intake of solute-free $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) and increase renal $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ excretion. In emergency states of very low ECF and effective circulating volume, some crosstalk occurs between the control systems for volume and osmolality. As a result, the body not only will try to conserve $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$but will also seek $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (by triggering thirst) and conserve $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (by concentrating the urine). Although water (in comparison to saline) is not a very good expander of plasma and ECF volume, it is better than nothing.

## TRANSPORT OF SOLUTES AND WATER ACROSS EPITHELIA

Thus far we have examined how cells transport solutes and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across their membranes and thereby control their intracellular composition. We now turn our attention to how the body controls the milieu intérieur, namely, the ECF that bathes the cells. Just as the cell membrane is the barrier between the ICF and ECF, epithelia are the barriers that separate the ECF from the outside world. In this subchapter, we examine the fundamental principles of how epithelial cells transport solutes and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across epithelial barriers.

An epithelium is an uninterrupted sheet of cells that are joined together by junctional complexes (see p. 43). These junctions serve as a selectively permeable barrier between the solutions on either side of the epithelium and demarcate the boundary between the apical and basolateral regions of the cell membrane. The apical and basolateral membranes are remarkably different in their transport function. This polarization allows the epithelial cell to transport $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and selected solutes from one compartment to another. In other words, the epithelium is capable of vectorial transport. In many cases, transport of solutes across an epithelium is an active process.

Membranes may be called by different names in different epithelia. The apical membrane can be known as the brush border, the mucosal membrane, or the luminal membrane. The basolateral membrane is also known as the serosal or peritubular membrane.

## The epithelial cell generally has different electrochemical gradients across its apical and basolateral membranes

Imagine an artificial situation in which an epithelium separates two identical solutions. Furthermore, imagine that there is no difference in voltage across the epithelium and no difference in hydrostatic pressure. Under these
circumstances, the driving forces for the passive movement of solutes or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ across the epithelium would be nil. Because the apical and basolateral membranes of the cell share the same cytosol, the electrochemical gradients across the apical and basolateral membranes would be identical.

However, this example is virtually never realistic for two reasons. First, because the composition of the "outside world" is not the same as that of ECF, transepithelial concentration differences occur. Second, transepithelial voltage is usually not zero. Thus, the electrochemical gradients across the apical and basolateral membranes of an epithelial cell are generally very different.

Electrophysiological methods provide two major types of information about ion transport by epithelial cells. First, electrophysiological techniques can define the electrical driving forces that act on ions either across the entire epithelium or across the individual apical and basolateral cell membranes. Second, these electrical measurements can define the overall electrical resistance of the epithelium or the electrical resistance of the individual apical and basolateral cell membranes.

The voltage difference between the solutions on either side of the epithelium is the transepithelial voltage $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{te}}\right)$. We can measure $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ by placing one microelectrode in the lumen of the organ or duct of which the epithelium is the wall and a second reference electrode in the blood or interstitial space (Fig. 5-20A). If we instead insert the first microelectrode directly into an epithelial cell (see Fig. 5-20A), the voltage difference between this cell and the reference electrode in blood or the interstitial space measures the basolateral cell membrane voltage $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{bl}}\right)$. Finally, if we compare the intracellular electrode with a reference electrode in the lumen (see Fig. 5-20A), the voltage difference is the apical cell membrane voltage $\left(\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$. Obviously, the sum of $V_{\mathrm{a}}$ and $V_{\mathrm{bl}}$ is equal to the transepithelial voltage (see Fig. 5-20B). It is also possible to insert ion-sensitive microelectrodes into the lumen or the epithelial cells and thereby determine the local activity of ions such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

By using the same voltage electrodes that we introduced in the preceding paragraph, we can pass electrical current across either the whole epithelium or the individual apical and basolateral membranes. From Ohm's law, it is thus possible to calculate the electrical resistance of the entire wall of the epithelium, or transepithelial resistance $\left(R_{\mathrm{te}}\right)$; that of the apical membrane, or apical resistance $\left(R_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$; or that of the basolateral membrane, or basolateral resistance $\left(R_{\mathrm{bl}}\right)$.

## Tight and leaky epithelia differ in the permeabilities of their tight junctions

One measure of how tightly an epithelium separates one compartment from another is its resistance to the flow of electrical current. The range of transepithelial electrical resistance is quite large. For example, $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of a rat proximal tubule has a resistance of only $6 \Omega$, whereas $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of a rabbit urinary bladder has a resistance of $70,000 \Omega$. Why is the range of $R_{\mathrm{te}}$ values so great? The cells of these epithelia do not differ greatly in either their apical or basolateral membrane resistances. Instead, the epithelia with low electrical resistances have a low-resistance pathway located in their tight junctions. Epithelia are thus classified as either "tight"

Figure 5-20 Measurement of voltages in an epithelium. A, The transepithelial voltage difference between electrodes placed in the lumen and interstitial space (or blood) is $V_{\mathrm{ie}}$. The basolateral voltage difference between electrodes placed in the cell and interstitial space is $V_{\mathrm{ie}}$. The apical voltage difference between electrodes placed in the lumen and cell is $V_{\mathrm{e}}$. B, Relative to the reference voltage of zero in the interstitial space, the voltage inside the cell in this example is -70 mV , and the voltage in the lumen is -3 mV . These values are typical of a cell in the renal proximal tubule or a small intestine.
(high electrical resistance) or "leaky," depending on the relative resistance of their tight junctions. In other words, the tight junctions of leaky epithelia are relatively more permeant to the diffusion of ions than the tight junctions of tight epithelia.

Now that we have introduced the concept that solutes and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ can move between epithelial cells through tight junctions, we can define two distinct pathways by which substances can cross epithelia. First, a substance can cross through the cell by sequentially passing across the apical and then the basolateral membranes, or vice versa. This route is
called the transcellular pathway. Second, a substance can bypass the cell entirely and cross the epithelium through the tight junctions and lateral intercellular spaces. This route is called the paracellular pathway.

As might be expected, leaky epithelia are not so good at maintaining large transepithelial ion or osmotic gradients. In general, leaky epithelia perform bulk transepithelial transport of solutes and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in a nearly isosmotic fashion (i.e., the transported fluid has nearly the same osmolality as the fluid from which it came). Examples include the small intestine and the proximal tubule of the kidney. As a general rule, tight epithelia generate or maintain large transepithelial ion concentration or osmotic gradients. Examples include the distal nephron of the kidney, the large intestine, and the tightest of all epithelia, the urinary bladder (whose function is to be an absolutely impermeable storage vessel).

In addition to tight junctions, epithelia share a number of basic properties. First, the Na-K pump is located exclusively on the basolateral membrane (Fig. 5-21). The only known exception is the choroid plexus, where the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump is located on the apical membrane.

Second, most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that is taken up by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump generally recycles back out across the basolateral membrane through $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 5-21). A consequence of the abundance of these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient predominantly determines $V_{\mathrm{ie}}$, which is usually 50 to 60 mV , inside negative.

Third, as in other cells, $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$, typically 10 to 30 mM , is much lower in an epithelial cell than in the ECF. This low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ is a consequence of the active extrusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The large, inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ electrochemical gradient serves as a driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ entry through apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and for the secondary active transport of other solutes across the apical membrane (e.g., by $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport, $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange, $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport) or the basolateral membrane (e.g., by Na-Ca exchange).

## Epithelial cells can absorb or secrete different solutes by inserting specific channels or transporters at either the apical or basolateral membrane

By placing different transporters at the apical and basolateral membranes, epithelia can accomplish net transepithelial transport of different solutes in either the absorptive or secretory direction. For example, the renal proximal tubule moves glucose from the tubule lumen to the blood by using an $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter (SGLT) to move glucose into the cell across the apical membrane, but it uses facilitated diffusion of glucose (GLUT) to move glucose out of the cell across the basolateral membrane. Clearly, the proximal tubule cell could not use the same $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter at both the apical and basolateral membranes because the electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient is similar across both membranes.

We will now look at four examples to illustrate how epithelia can absorb or secrete various solutes by using the transporters discussed above in this chapter.
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Absorption Consider the model in Figure 5-21A, which is similar to that first proposed by Hans Ussing and

coworkers to explain NaCl absorption across the frog skin. The basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump pumps $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell, thereby lowering $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and generating an inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient across the apical membrane. This apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient, in turn, provides the driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to enter the cell passively across the apical membrane through $\mathrm{ENaC} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that enters the cell in this way is pumped out across the basolateral membrane in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, which recycles back out across the basolateral membrane. Note that the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump generates a current of positive charge across the cell from lumen to interstitium. This current, in turn, creates a lumen-negative transepithelial voltage that can then provide a driving force for passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ absorption across the tight junctions-through the so-called paracellular pathway. The net result is NaCl absorption. This process contributes to NaCl reabsorption in the collecting tubule of the kidney.
$\mathrm{K}^{+}$Secretion With slight alterations, the same basic cell model can explain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion as well as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 5-21B). Adding $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels to the apical membrane allows some of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that is taken up by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump across the basolateral membrane to be secreted across the apical membrane. This mechanism is the basis of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the collecting tubule of the kidney. Such a model accurately predicts that drugs such as amiloride, which blocks apical $\mathrm{ENaC} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in these cells, will inhibit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion as well as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption.

Glucose Absorption The small intestine and proximal tubule absorb nutrients that are present in the luminal compartment by secondary active cotransport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$with organic solutes. An example is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$cotransport with glucose by SGLT (see Fig. 5-21C). The inwardly directed electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the apical membrane,

generated by the Na-K pump, now drives the entry of both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose. Glucose, which has accumulated in the cell against its concentration gradient, exits passively across the basolateral membrane by a carrier-mediated transporter (GLUT) that is not coupled to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Again, the flow of positive current across the cell generates a lumen-negative transepithelial voltage that can drive passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption across the tight junctions. The net effect is absorption of both NaCl and glucose.
$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$Secretion If the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$entry mechanism is located on the basolateral membrane, the same basic cell model can account for NaCl secretion into the lumen (see Fig. 5-21D). The inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient now drives secondary active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake across the basolateral membrane by the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter NKCC1. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$accumulated in the cell in this way can then exit across the apical membrane passively through $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels such as CFTR. Notice that negative charges now move across the cell from interstitium to lumen and generate a lumen-negative voltage that can drive passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$secretion across the tight junctions (paracellular pathway). The net process is NaCl secretion, even though the primary active transporter, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, is pumping $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the cell to the interstitium. Secretory cells in the intestine and pulmonary airway epithelium use this mechanism for secreting NaCl .

## Water transport across epithelia passively follows solute transport

In general, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ moves passively across an epithelium in response to osmotic gradients. An epithelium that secretes salt will secrete fluid, and one that absorbs salt will absorb fluid. The finite permeability of the bare lipid bilayer to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and the presence of AQPs in most cell membranes ensure that osmotic equilibration for most cells is rapid. In addition, particularly in leaky epithelia, tight junctions provide a pathway for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement between the epithelial cells. However, epithelial $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability (hydraulic conductivity) varies widely because of differences in membrane lipid composition and in abundance of AQPs. The presence of AQPs in the plasma membrane may be either constitutive or highly regulated.

Absorption of a Hyperosmotic Fluid If the epithelium absorbs more salt than its isotonic equivalent volume of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the absorbate is hyperosmotic. An example is the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in the kidney, which reabsorbs a large amount of salt but relatively little $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. As a result, dilute fluid is left behind in the lumen, and the renal interstitium is rendered hyperosmotic.

Absorption of an Isosmotic Fluid In certain epithelia, such as the renal proximal tubule and small intestine, net $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement occurs with no detectable osmotic gradients across the epithelium (Fig. 5-22). Moreover, the reabsorbed fluid appears to be nearly isosmotic with respect to luminal fluid. Of course, fluid absorption could not really occur without the requisite solute driving force across the epithelium. Two explanations, which are not exclusive, have been offered.

First, the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability of epithelia performing isosmotic $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reabsorption might be extremely high because of the high constitutive expression of AQPs in the apical and basolateral membranes. Thus, modest transepithelial osmotic gradients (perhaps only 1 to 2 mOsm ), which are the product of solute absorption, are sufficient to drive $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport at the rates observed. Measurements cannot distinguish such small osmotic gradients from no gradient at all.

Second, the lateral intercellular spaces between the epithelial cells (lateral interspaces; see Fig. 5-22, option 1) as well as the spaces between the infoldings of the basal membrane (basal labyrinth; see Fig. 5-22, option 2) might be modestly hyperosmotic as a consequence of the accumulation of absorbed solutes in a localized region. The resulting localized osmotic gradient would pull $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the lateral interspaces from the cell (across the lateral portion of the basolateral membrane) or from the lumen (across the tight junction). Similarly, a localized osmotic gradient would pull $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the basal labyrinth from the cell (across the basal portion of the basolateral membrane). By the time that the fluid emerges from these spaces and reaches the interstitium, it would have become nearly isosmotic.

Absorption of a Hypo-osmotic Fluid If both sides of an epithelium are bathed by isosmotic solutions, it is not possible to concentrate the fluid in the lumen. You might imagine that the epithelium could accomplish the task by absorbing a hypo-osmotic fluid. However, this would require absorbing more $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ than solute, which would require $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport to "lead" rather than to follow solute transport. Indeed, active transport of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ does not occur, (5) NS-21 and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ cannot move against an osmotic gradient. Hypo-osmotic fluid absorption does indeed occur in the body but requires that the osmolality of the basolateral compartment exceed that of the apical compartment. As discussed on p. 816, the medullary collecting duct uses this approach to concentrate the urine. The collecting duct absorbs a hypo-osmotic fluid because (1) the interstitial fluid in the renal medulla is hyperosmotic and (2) the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability of the renal collecting duct is high due to the insertion of AQP2-under hormonal control-into the apical membrane.

## Epithelia can regulate transport by controlling transport proteins, tight junctions, and the supply of the transported substances

A large range of physiological stimuli regulate the rates at which specific epithelia transport specific solutes. Virtually all known intracellular signaling cascades (see Chapter 3) have been implicated in mediating these regulatory effects. Ultimately, these cascades must affect the rates at which specific solutes move through transporters or channels.

Increased Synthesis (or Degradation) of Transport Proteins One approach for modifying transport activity is to change the number of transport molecules in the cell. For example, the hormone aldosterone directly or indirectly increases the transcription rate of genes that encode Na-K pump subunits, thereby increasing Na-K pump synthesis in the distal nephron of the kidney.

# N5-21 The Water-Pump Controversy 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Loo and colleagues have proposed that the Na/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in the human small intestine cotransports not only $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose, but water as well. In other words, with each cycle, SGLT1 would move $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, 1 glucose molecule, and $>200$ water molecules. The authors envisage that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and glucose molecule-along with the water molecules-would diffuse from the extracellular fluid into a pore within the cotransporter protein. The cotransporter would then undergo a conformational change that would close an outer gate and thereby occlude these ions and molecules from the extracellular fluid. By opening an inner gate, the cotransporter would deocclude these particles and allow the $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, the glucose molecule, and the 200+ water molecules to enter the cytoplasm of the intestinal cell (i.e., enterocyte). There is no controversy that this general model-minus the water-explains how SGLT1 works. The question is whether each cycle of the cotransporter also moves a fixed number of water molecules through the membrane protein along with the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose. Loo and colleagues suggest that the water pumped by SGLT1 would account for about half of the water taken up by the small intestine.

On the other hand, Lapointe and colleagues have challenged the conclusion of Loo and colleagues, suggesting that the data of Loo and colleagues can more easily be explained by the classical model. That is, as SGLT1 cotransport $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid, water would follow osmotically.

Figure 5-22 Model of isotonic water transport in a leaky epithelium. Na-K pumps present on the lateral and basal membrane pump $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into two restricted spaces: the lateral intercellular space and restricted spaces formed by infoldings of the basal membrane. The locally high osmolality in the lateral intercellular space pulls water from the lumen and the cell. Similarly, the locally high osmolality in the restricted basal spaces pulls water from the cell. The solution that emerges from these two restricted spaces-and enters the interstitial space-is only slightly hypertonic (virtually isotonic) compared with the luminal solution.

Recruitment of Transport Proteins to the Cell Membrane Cells can also change the functional activity of transporters by storing some of them in an intracellular organelle "pool" and then inserting them into the cell membrane. For example, histamine causes cytoplasmic "tubulovesicles" containing $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps (the pool) to fuse with the apical membrane of gastric parietal cells, which initiates gastric acid secretion.

Post-translational Modification of Pre-existing Transport Proteins Another approach for modulating the transporter rate is to change the activity of pre-existing transport proteins. For example, increases in the level of intracellular cAMP enhance the phosphorylation of apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels that are involved in NaCl secretion by intestinal and airway epithelia. The cystic fibrosis gene product (CFTR) is a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel whose function is regulated by phosphorylation. A defect in the regulation of apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels is the primary physiological abnormality in cystic fibrosis.

Changes in the Paracellular Pathway The passive movement of solutes across the tight junction can contribute to either "forward" transepithelial movement of the solute or backleak of the solute, depending on the solute gradients. Thus, the epithelium can modulate net transport by changing the permeability of the paracellular pathway. For example,
the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability of the tight junctions of the proximal tubule increases when ECF volume increases. This increase in the permeability of the paracellular pathway may lower net $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption because of increased backleak of absorbed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the lateral interspace, across the tight junction, and into the lumen.

Luminal Supply of Transported Species and Flow Rate Changes in the concentration of transported solutes can have profound effects on rates of net solute transport. As fluid moves along the renal proximal tubule, for example, the very process of glucose absorption depletes glucose from the lumen and thereby slows further glucose absorption. Increasing the rate at which fresh high-glucose fluid enters the proximal-tubule lumen raises the glucose concentration at the site of glucose uptake and thus increases the rate of glucose absorption. In addition, flow itself-most likely sensed by bending of the central cilium (see p. 43) present at the apical membrane of most types of epithelial cells-can trigger signaling cascades resulting in alteration of transporter and channel function.

# ELECTROPHYSIOLOGY OF THE CELL MEMBRANE 

Edward G. Moczydlowski

Physics is concerned with the fundamental nature of matter and energy, whereas the goal of medical physiology is to understand the workings of living tissue. Despite their different perspectives, physics and physiology share common historical roots in the early investigations of charge and electricity. In the late 1700s, Luigi Galvani, a professor of anatomy in Bologna, Italy, used the leg muscles of a dissected frog to assay the presence of electrical charge stored in various ingenious devices that were the predecessors of modern capacitors and batteries. He observed that frog legs vigorously contracted when electrical stimulation was applied either directly to the leg muscle or to the nerves leading to the muscle (Fig. 6-1). Such early physiological experiments contributed to the development of electromagnetic theory in physics and electrophysiological theory in biology.

The phenomenon of "animal electricity" is central to the understanding of physiological processes. Throughout this book, we describe many basic functions of tissues and organs in terms of electrical signals mediated by cell membranes. Whereas electrical currents in a metal wire are conducted by the flow of electrons, electrical currents across cell membranes are carried by the major inorganic ions of physiological fluids: $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Many concepts and terms used in cellular electrophysiology are the same as those used to describe electrical circuits. At the molecular level, electrical current across cell membranes flows via three unique classes of integral membrane proteins (see pp. 17-18): ion channels, electrogenic ion transporters, and electrogenic ion pumps. The flow of ions via specific types of channels is the basis of electrical signals that underlie neuronal activity and animal behavior. Opening and closing of such channels is the fundamental process behind electrical phenomena such as the nerve impulse, the heartbeat, and sensory perception. Channel proteins are also intimately involved in hormone secretion, ionic homeostasis, osmoregulation, and regulation of muscle contractility.

This chapter begins with a review of basic principles of electricity and introduces the essentials of electrophysiology. We also discuss the molecular biology of ion channels and provide an overview of channel structure and function.

## IONIC BASIS OF MEMBRANE POTENTIALS

Principles of electrostatics explain why aqueous pores formed by channel proteins are needed for ion diffusion across cell membranes

The plasma membranes of most living cells are electrically polarized, as indicated by the presence of a transmembrane
voltage-or a membrane potential-in the range of 0.1 V . In Chapter 5, we discussed how the energy stored in this miniature battery can drive a variety of transmembrane transport processes. Electrically excitable cells such as brain neurons and heart myocytes also use this energy for signaling purposes. The brief electrical impulses produced by such cells are called action potentials. To explain these electrophysiological phenomena, we begin with a basic review of electrical energy.

Atoms consist of negatively ( - ) and positively ( + ) charged elementary particles, such as electrons ( $\mathrm{e}^{-}$) and protons ( $\mathrm{H}^{+}$), as well as electrically neutral particles (neutrons). Charges of the same sign repel each other, and those of opposite sign attract. Charge is measured in units of coulombs (C). The unitary charge of one electron or proton is denoted by $e_{0}$ and is equal to $1.6022 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$. Ions in solution have a charge valence $(z)$ that is an integral number of elementary charges. For example, $z=+2$ for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, z=+1$ for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $z=-1$ for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The charge of a single ion $\left(q_{0}\right)$, measured in coulombs, is the product of its valence and the elementary charge:

$$
q_{0}=z e_{0}
$$

In an aqueous solution or a bulk volume of matter, the number of positive and negative charges is always equal. Charge is also conserved in any chemical reaction.

The attractive electrostatic force between two ions that have valences of $z_{1}$ and $z_{2}$ can be obtained from Coulomb's law. $\bigcirc$ №-1 This force $(\mathcal{F})$ is proportional to the product of these valences and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (a) between the two. The force is also inversely proportional to a dimensionless term called the dielectric constant $\left(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}\right)$ :

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{z_{1} \cdot z_{2}}{\varepsilon_{r} a^{2}}
$$

Because the dielectric constant of water is $\sim 40$-fold greater than that of the hydrocarbon interior of the cell membrane, the electrostatic force between ions is reduced by a factor of $\sim 40$ in water compared with membrane lipid.

If we were to move an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid without the aid of any proteins, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ would have to cross the membrane by "dissolving" in the lipids of the bilayer. However, the energy required to transfer an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion from water (high $\varepsilon$ ) to the interior of a phospholipid membrane (low $\varepsilon$ ) is $\sim 36 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$. This value is 60 -fold higher than molecular thermal energy at room

# N6-1 Coulomb's Law 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The attractive electrostatic force between two charged particles of opposite sign and the repulsive electrostatic force between two charged particles of the same sign are described by Coulomb's law. The coulombic force between two interacting particles with charges of $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ is

$$
\mathcal{F}=\frac{q_{1} q_{2}}{4 \pi \varepsilon_{r} \varepsilon_{0} \partial^{2}}
$$

( $\mathbf{N E} \mathbf{6 - 1}$ )

The above equation shows that the electrostatic force is directly proportional to the product of the charges and is inversely proportional to the square of the distance, $a$, between them. $\varepsilon_{0}$ is a physical constant called the permittivity of free space (or the vacuum permittivity) and is equal to $8.854 \times 10^{-12}$ $\mathrm{C}^{2} \mathrm{~N}^{-1} \mathrm{~m}^{-2}$, where C is coulomb, N is newton, and m is meter. The denominator of the equation also includes a dimensionless parameter called the dielectric constant ( $\varepsilon_{r}$ ), also known as the relative permittivity. The dielectric constant of a vacuum is defined as 1.0. The dielectric constant is a property that depends on the polarizability of the medium surrounding the two charges. Polarizability refers to the ability of molecules of the medium to orient themselves around ions to reduce electrostatic interactions. Polar water molecules are able to solvate ions effectively by orienting themselves around ions in solutions and thereby reducing coulombic forces between neighboring ions. The dielectric constant of water is therefore relatively high and has a value of $\sim 80$. For a nonpolar hydrocarbon, such as decane or the alkyl-chain interior of a phospholipid bilayer, $\varepsilon$ is comparatively low and has a value of $\sim 2$.

Figure 6-1 in the text illustrates a well-known series of experiments by Luigi Galvani. A, Electrical stimulation of a dissected frog with diverse sources of electricity. On the center of the table is a board with a dissected frog that has been prepared for an experiment (Fig. 12). A hand with a charged metal rod (G) is about to touch the sacral nerves (D), contracting the limbs (C). A metal wire ( $F$ ) penetrates the spinal cord; a second metal wire ( $K$ ) grounds the first wire to the floor. On the left side of the table (Fig. 1) is a large "electrical machine" with a rotating disk (A), a conductor (C), and a hand holding a metal rod (B) that is about to be charged. On the extreme left of the room (Fig. 2), a dissected frog is suspended from an iron wire that penetrates the spinal cord (F); the wire is attached to the wall by a hook. A hand with a charged metal rod (G) is touching the wire, stimulating the sacral nerves (D) and causing the legs (C) to twitch. Outside the room on the extreme right side (Fig. 3) is a frog in a glass jar (A). Emerging from the glass jar is an iron wire (B) that is attached at one end to a hook on the frog and ends in a hook (C) in the air. A silk loop (D) near this hook connects to a long conductor (F) that runs near the ceiling to a hook in the wall at the extreme left of the main room. At the far right/front of the table in the main room (Fig. 4) is a dissected frog with one conductor connected to a nerve (C) and another connected to a muscle (D). Just behind
this frog (Fig. 5) is a "Leiden jar" (A) containing small lead shot used by hunters. A hand with a charged metal rod (C) is about to touch a conductor (B) emerging from the jar. To the left of the Leiden jar (Fig. 6) is an inverted jar (A) with lead shot (C). This jar sits on top of a similar jar (B) containing a suspended, dissected frog and is connected by a conductor to the lead shot in the upper jar. The legs of the frog are grounded to lead shot near the bottom of the jar. B, Electrical stimulation of the leg muscles of a dissected frog by "natural electricity" (i.e., lightning). In one experiment (Fig. 7), an iron wire (A) runs from near the roof, through several insulating glass tubes (B), to a flask (C) that contains a freshly dissected frog. A second wire (D) grounds the frog's legs to the water in the well. In a second experiment (Fig. 8), a noninsulated wire extends from an iron hook fastened to the wall and to the spinal cord of a frog (E), which is on a table coated with oil.

temperature. Thus, the probability that an ion would dissolve in the bilayer (i.e., partition from an aqueous solution into the lipid interior of a cell membrane) is essentially zero. This analysis explains why inorganic ions cannot readily cross a phospholipid membrane without the aid of other molecules such as specialized transporters or channel proteins, which provide a favorable polar environment for the ion as it moves across the membrane (Fig. 6-2).

## Membrane potentials can be measured with microelectrodes as well as dyes or fluorescent proteins that are voltage sensitive

The voltage difference across the cell membrane, or the membrane potential $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, is the difference between the electrical potential in the cytoplasm $\left(\psi_{\mathrm{e}}\right)$ and the electrical potential in the extracellular space $\left(\psi_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$. Figure 6-3A shows how to measure $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ with an intracellular electrode. The sharp tip of a microelectrode is gently inserted into the cell and measures the transmembrane potential with respect to the electrical potential of the extracellular solution, defined as ground (i.e., $\psi_{\mathrm{e}}=0$ ). If the cell membrane is not damaged by electrode impalement and the impaled membrane seals tightly around the glass, this technique provides an accurate

measurement of $V_{m}$. Such a voltage measurement is called an intracellular recording.

For an amphibian or mammalian skeletal muscle cell, resting $V_{m}$ is typically about -90 mV , which means that the interior of the resting cell is -90 mV more negative than the exterior. There is a simple relationship between the electrical potential difference across a membrane and another parameter, the electric field (E): (5) N6-2

$$
E=\frac{V_{\mathrm{m}} \leftarrow \text { Electrical potential difference across the membrane }}{a \leftarrow \text { Distance across the membrane }}
$$

Accordingly, for a $V_{m}$ of -0.1 V and a membrane thickness of $a=4 \mathrm{~nm}$ (i.e., $40 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~cm}$ ), the magnitude of the electric field is $\sim 250,000 \mathrm{~V} / \mathrm{cm}$. Thus, despite the small transmembrane voltage, cell membranes actually sustain a very large electric field. Below, we discuss how this electric field influences the activity of a particular class of membrane signaling proteins called voltage-gated ion channels (see pp. 182-199).

Skeletal muscle cells, cardiac cells, and neurons typically have resting membrane potentials of approximately -60 to -90 mV ; smooth-muscle cells have membrane potentials in the range of -55 mV ; and the $V_{m}$ of the human erythrocyte is only about -9 mV . However, certain bacteria and plant cells have transmembrane voltages as large as -200 mV . For very small cells such as erythrocytes, small intracellular organelles such as mitochondria, and fine processes such as the synaptic endings of neurons, $V_{m}$ cannot be directly measured with a microelectrode. Instead, spectroscopic techniques allow the membrane potentials of such inaccessible membranes to be measured indirectly (see Fig. 6-3B). Such techniques involve labeling of the cell or membrane with an appropriate organic dye molecule and monitoring of the absorption or fluorescence of the dye. The optical signal of the dye molecule can be independently calibrated as a function of $V_{m}$.

Another approach for monitoring changes in $V_{m}$ optically is to use cells that express genetically engineered voltagesensing proteins that have been coupled to a modified version of the jellyfish green fluorescent protein (GFP). (5) N6-3 For their work on GFP, Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Tsien shared the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (6) N6-4 Whether $V_{m}$ is measured directly by a microelectrode or indirectly by a spectroscopic technique, virtually all biological membranes are found to have a nonzero membrane potential. This transmembrane voltage is an important determinant of any physiological transport process that involves the movement of charge.

Measurements of $V_{m}$ have shown that many types of cells are electrically excitable. Examples of excitable cells are neurons, muscle fibers, heart cells, and secretory cells of the pancreas. In such cells, $V_{m}$ exhibits characteristic timedependent changes in response to electrical or chemical stimulation. When the cell body, or soma, of a neuron is electrically stimulated, electrical and optical methods for measuring $V_{m}$ detect an almost identical response at the cell body (see Fig. 6-3C). The optical method provides the additional insight that $V_{m}$ changes are similar but delayed in the more distant neuronal processes inaccessible to a
microelectrode (see Fig. 6-3D). When the cell is not undergoing such active responses, $V_{m}$ usually remains at a steady value that is called the resting potential. In the next section, we discuss the origin of the membrane potential and lay the groundwork for understanding its active responses.

## Membrane potential is generated by ion gradients

Chapter 5 introduced the concept that some integral membrane proteins are electrogenic transporters in that they generate an electrical current that sets up an electrical potential across the membrane. One class of electrogenic transporters includes the ATP-dependent ion pumps. These proteins use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to produce and to maintain concentration gradients of ions across cell membranes. In animal cells, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and Ca pump are responsible for maintaining normal gradients of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The reactions catalyzed by these ion transport enzymes are electrogenic because they lead to separation of charge across the membrane. For example, enzymatic turnover of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (see pp. 115-117) results in the translocation of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions out of the cell and two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions into the cell, with a net movement of one positive charge out of the cell. In addition to electrogenic pumps, cells may express secondary active transporters that are electrogenic, such as the $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter (see pp. 121-122).

It may seem that the inside negative $V_{m}$ originates from the continuous pumping of positive charges out of the cell by the electrogenic Na-K pump. The resting potential of large cells-whose surface-to-volume ratio is so large that ion gradients run down slowly-is maintained for a long time even when metabolic poisons block ATP-dependent energy metabolism. This finding implies that an ATP-dependent pump is not the immediate energy source underlying the membrane potential. Indeed, the squid giant axon normally has a resting potential of -60 mV . When the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump in the giant axon membrane is specifically inhibited with a cardiac glycoside (see p. 117), the immediate positive shift in $V_{m}$ is only 1.4 mV . Thus, in most cases, the direct contribution of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump to the resting $V_{m}$ is very small.

In contrast, many experiments have shown that cell membrane potentials depend on ionic concentration gradients. In a classic experiment, Paul Horowicz and Alan Hodgkin measured the $V_{m}$ of a frog muscle fiber with an intracellular microelectrode. The muscle fiber was bathed in a modified physiological solution in which $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ replaced $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, a manipulation that eliminates the contribution of anions to $V_{m}$. In the presence of normal extracellular concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$for amphibians $\left(\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}=2.5 \mathrm{mM}\right.$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{o}=$ 120 mM ), the frog muscle fiber has a resting $V_{m}$ of approximately -94 mV . As $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is increased above 2.5 mM by substitution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, V_{m}$ shifts in the positive direction. As $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is decreased below $2.5 \mathrm{mM}, V_{m}$ becomes more negative (Fig. 6-4). For $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ values $>10 \mathrm{mM}$, the $V_{m}$ measured in Figure 6-4 is approximately a linear function of the logarithm of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$. Numerous experiments of this kind have demonstrated that the immediate energy source of the membrane potential is not the active pumping of ions but rather the potential energy stored in the ion concentration gradients themselves. Of course, it is the ion pumps-and the secondary active transporters that derive their energy from these

## N6-2 Electric Fields and Potentials

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

A useful way to represent the electrical force ( $\mathcal{F}$ ) acting on a charged particle is by the concept of an electric field. The electric field (E) is defined as the force that a particle with positive charge $\mathrm{q}_{0}$ would sense in the vicinity of a charge source. Forces are vector parameters that are described by a magnitude and a direction. The direction of an electrostatic force is defined by the direction in which a positive charge would move: namely, away from a positively charged source or toward a negatively charged source. Similarly, the direction of an electric field is the direction in which a positive test charge would move within the field. The definition of an electric field is

$$
E=\frac{\mathcal{F}}{q_{0}}
$$

Although the net charge of any bulk system must be equal to zero, other forms of energy, such as chemical energy, can be used to separate positive and negative charges. The electrical potential ( $\psi$ ) describes the potential energy that arises from such a separation of charge. The electrical potential difference ( $\Delta \psi$ ) is a measure of the work $\left(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{O}}\right)$ needed to move a test charge $q_{0}$ between two points ( 1 and 2 ) in an electric field:

$$
\Delta \psi=\psi_{2}-\psi_{1}=V=\frac{W_{\mathrm{O}}}{q_{0}}=\frac{\text { joules }}{\text { coulombs }}=\text { volts }
$$

The electrical potential difference ( $V$ ) is measured in volts (i.e., joules per coulomb). Because work is also equal to force times distance, the electrical potential difference may also be expressed in terms of the magnitude of the force required to move a test charge ( $q_{0}$ ) over a distance ( $a$, in centimeters), along the same direction as the force. With the help of the preceding two equations, we can therefore define the electrical potential difference in terms of the electric field (volts per centimeter):

$$
V=\frac{W_{\mathrm{O}}}{q_{0}}=\frac{\mathcal{F} a}{q_{0}}=E a
$$

Thus, the voltage difference between two points is the product of electric field and the distance between those points. Conversely, the electric field is the voltage difference divided by the distance:

$$
E=\frac{V}{a}
$$

## N6-3 Measuring Membrane Potential with Fluorescent Proteins

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Figure 6-3 illustrates well-established methods for measuring the membrane potential of cells with a sharp intracellular microelectrode connected to a voltage amplifier or with the use of voltage-sensitive membrane dyes that can be calibrated to known values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. In recent years it has become possible to express a genetically engineered fluorescent voltagesensing protein in a cell of interest and record changes in $V_{m}$ such as neuronal action potential signals by measuring the fluorescence signal. This method became feasible with the discovery of proteins that exhibit natural fluorescence in the visible spectral region of light. One such fluorescent protein is the green fluorescent protein (GFP) of the luminescent jellyfish Aequorea victoria. The discovery, determination of the mechanism of fluorescence, and wide application of GFP in biotechnology was recognized with the awarding of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to Osamu Shimomura, Martin Chalfie, and Roger Tsien. (5) N6-4

So that GFP could be used to measure $V_{m}$, the GFP gene was inserted into a nonconducting mutant of the Drosophila $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, Shaker. Expression of the GFP-tagged Shaker results in observable green fluorescence in the membrane of a transfected cell, which changes fluorescence intensity in response to changes in $V_{m}$. More recently, a pair of GFP variants called CYP for cyan (blue) and YFP for yellow fluorescent protein were fused to the C terminus of a voltage-sensor domain of a voltage-sensing phosphatase enzyme (Ci-VSP) of Ciona intestinalis. The voltage-sensing domain of VSP is homologous to the S1 to S4 domains of voltage-gated channels. Expression of such fluorescent Ci-VSP in neurons allows $V_{m}$ changes corresponding to a fast action potential to be recorded optically. The mechanism of $V_{m}$ measurement by these engineered proteins involves voltage-dependent conformational changes of the protein that result in a spectroscopic change of the fluorescent protein tag. With improvement of these methods, it should be possible to optically record electrical signals from cells of appropriately engineered transgenic animals. This technique thus has the potential to greatly advance understanding of cellular electrophysiology.

pumps-that are responsible for generating and maintaining these ion gradients.

One way to investigate the role of ion gradients in determining $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is to study this phenomenon in an in vitro (cellfree) system. Many investigators have used an artificial model of a cell membrane called a planar lipid bilayer. This system consists of a partition with a hole $\sim 200 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter that separates two chambers filled with aqueous solutions (Fig. 6-5). It is possible to paint a planar lipid bilayer having a thickness of only $\sim 4 \mathrm{~nm}$ across the hole, thereby sealing the partition. By incorporating membrane proteins and other molecules into planar bilayers, one can study the essential characteristics of their function in isolation from the complex metabolism of living cells. Transmembrane voltage can be measured across a planar bilayer with a voltmeter connected to a pair of $\mathrm{Ag} / \mathrm{AgCl}$ electrodes that are in electrical contact with the solution on each side of the membrane via salt bridges. This experimental arrangement is much like an intracellular voltage recording, except that both sides of the membrane are completely accessible to manipulation.

The ionic composition of the two chambers on opposite sides of the bilayer can be adjusted to simulate cellular concentration gradients. Suppose that we put 4 mM KCl on the left side of the bilayer and 155 mM KCl on the right side to mimic, respectively, the external and internal concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for a mammalian muscle cell. To eliminate the osmotic flow of water between the two compartments (see p. 128), we also add a sufficient amount of a nonelectrolyte (e.g., mannitol) to the side with 4 mM KCl . (5) N6-5 We can make the membrane selectively permeable to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by introducing purified $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ionophores into the membrane. (5) N6-6 Assuming that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are in an

open state and are impermeable to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the right ("internal") compartment quickly becomes electrically negative with respect to the left ("external") compartment because positive charge (i.e., $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) diffuses from high to low concentration. However, as the negative voltage develops in the right compartment, the negativity opposes further $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux from the right compartment. Eventually, the voltage difference across the membrane becomes so negative that further net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement halts. At this point, the system is in equilibrium, and the transmembrane voltage reaches a value of 92.4 mV , right-side negative. In the process of generating the transmembrane voltage, a separation of charge has occurred in such a way that the excess positive charge on the left side (low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$) balances the same excess negative charge on the right side (high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$). Thus, the stable voltage difference $(\sim 92.4 \mathrm{mV})$ arises from the separation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions from their counterions (in this case $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$) across the bilayer membrane.

## N6-5 An Impermeant Bilayer

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

If a totally impermeant bilayer were not separating the two solutions, the unequal concentrations of KCl would lead to diffusion of the salt in the direction of high to low [KCl]. However, by sealing the hole in the partition with a pure lipid bilayer having no permeability to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, we ensure that the system does not have any separation of charge, and therefore the measured transmembrane voltage is 0 mV .

## N6-28 Planar Lipid Bilayers

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Planar bilayers can be readily formed by spreading a solution of phospholipids across a small hole in a thin plastic partition that separates two chambers filled with aqueous solution. The lipid solution seals the hole and spontaneously thins to produce a stable phospholipid bilayer. This artificial membrane, by itself, is structurally much like a cell membrane, except that it is completely devoid of protein. In the example in Figure 6-5, purified $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels have been incorporated into the membrane. Because of the large $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient across this $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-permeable membrane, a transmembrane voltage of 92.4 mV (right-side negative) develops spontaneously across the membrane.

## N6-6 Ionophores

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

We can create a perfectly $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selective membrane by adding certain organic molecules, known as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ionophores, to a planar lipid bilayer. Examples are valinomycin and gramicidin. These molecules have the ability to partition into bilayers and catalyze the diffusion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$across phospholipid membranes. Valinomycin and gramicidin act by different mechanisms, but both allow a current of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to flow across membranes. Valinomycin, which is isolated from Streptomyces fulvissimus, is an example of a carrier molecule that binds $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and literally ferries it across the lipid bilayer. On the other hand, gramicidin catalyzes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement by the same basic mechanism that has been established for ion channel proteins in cell membranes. Gramicidin, a small, unusual peptide produced by Bacillus brevis, forms a water-filled pore across the membrane with a very small diameter ( 0.4 nm ). The pore is small enough to permit only water molecules or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to move through in single file. Both gramicidin and valinomycin share another property of channel proteins, called ionic selectivity. These ionophores are strongly cation selective: they accept certain inorganic cations but not $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$or other anions.

## For mammalian cells, Nernst potentials for ions typically range from -100 mV for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to +100 mV for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$

The model system of a planar bilayer (impermeable membrane), unequal salt solutions (ionic gradient), and an ion-selective channel (conductance pathway) contains the minimal components essential for generating a membrane potential. The hydrophobic membrane bilayer is a formidable barrier to inorganic ions and is also a poor conductor of electricity. Poor conductors are said to have a high resistance to electrical current-in this case, ionic current. On the other hand, ion channels act as molecular conductors of ions. They introduce a conductance pathway into the membrane and lower its resistance.

In the planar-bilayer experiment of Figure 6-5, $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ originates from the diffusion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$down its concentration gradient. Membrane potentials that arise by this mechanism are called diffusion potentials. At equilibrium, the diffusion potential of an ion is the same as the equilibrium potential $\left(E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ given by the Nernst equation previously introduced as Equation 5-8.

$$
E_{\mathrm{X}}=-\frac{R T}{z_{\mathrm{X}} F} \ln \frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{i}}{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}}
$$

The Nernst equation predicts the equilibrium membrane potential for any concentration gradient of a particular ion across a membrane. $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ is often simply referred to as the Nernst potential. The Nernst potentials for $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are written as $E_{\mathrm{K}}, E_{\mathrm{Na}}, E_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, and $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$, respectively.

The linear portion of the plot of $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ versus the logarithm of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ for a frog muscle cell (see Fig. 6-4) has a slope that is -58.1 mV for a 10 -fold change in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$, as predicted by the Nernst equation. Indeed, if we insert the appropriate values for $R$ and $F$ into Equation 6-4, select a temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, and convert the logarithm base $e$ (In) to the logarithm base $10\left(\log _{10}\right)$, we obtain a coefficient of -58.1 mV , and the Nernst equation becomes

$$
E_{\mathrm{K}}=(-58.1 \mathrm{mV}) \log _{10} \frac{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{i}}{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}
$$

For a negative ion such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, where $z=-1$, the sign of the slope is positive:

$$
E_{\mathrm{Cl}}=(+58.1 \mathrm{mV}) \log _{10} \frac{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}}{\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}
$$

For $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}(z=+2)$, the slope is half of -58.1 mV , or approximately -30 mV . Note that a Nernst slope of 58.1 mV is the value for a univalent ion at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For mammalian cells at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, this value is 61.5 mV .

At $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ values above $\sim 10 \mathrm{mM}$, the magnitude of $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ and the slope of the plot in Figure 6-4 are virtually the same as those predicted by the Nernst equation (see Equation $6-5$ ), which suggests that the resting $V_{\text {in }}$ of the muscle cell is almost equal to the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diffusion potential. When $V_{\text {in }}$ follows the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the membrane is said to behave like a potassium electrode because ion-specific electrodes monitor ion concentrations according to the Nernst equation.

Table 6-1 lists the expected Nernst potentials for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$as calculated from the known concentration gradients of these physiologically important inorganic ions for mammalian skeletal muscle and typical nonmuscle cells. For a mammalian muscle cell with a $V_{\text {in }}$ of $-80 \mathrm{mV}, E_{\mathrm{K}}$ is $\sim 15 \mathrm{mV}$ more negative than $V_{\text {in }}$, whereas $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ are about +67 and +123 mV , respectively, far more positive than $V_{\text {in }}$. $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ is $\sim 9 \mathrm{mV}$ more negative than $V_{\text {in }}$ in muscle cells but slightly more positive than the typical $V_{\text {in }}$ of -60 mV in most other cells.

What determines whether the cell membrane potential follows the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$rather than that for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ? As we shall see in the next two sections, $V_{\text {in }}$ depends on the relative permeabilities of the cell membrane to the various ions and the concentrations of ions on both sides of the membrane. Thus, the stability of $V_{\text {in }}$ depends on the constancy of plasma ion concentrationsan important aspect of the homeostasis of the milieu intérieur (see pp. 3-4). Changes in the ionic composition of blood plasma can therefore profoundly affect physiological function. For example, conditions of low or high plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]-$ termed hypokalemia and hyperkalemia (see pp. 792-793), respectively-result in neurological and cardiac impairment (see Box 37-1) due to changes in $V_{\text {in }}$ of excitable cells.

## Currents carried by ions across membranes depend on the concentration of ions on both sides of the membrane, the membrane potential, and the permeability of the membrane to each ion

Years before ion channel proteins were discovered, physiologists devised a simple but powerful way to predict the membrane potential, even if several different kinds of permeable ions are present at the same time. The first step, which we discuss in this section, is to compute an ionic current, that is, the movement of a single ion species through the membrane. The second step, which we describe in the following section, is to obtain $V_{\text {in }}$ by summing the currents carried by each species of ion present, assuming that each species moves independently of the others.

The process of ion permeation through the membrane is called electrodiffusion because both electrical and

![bo1434543376c](bo1434543376c.jpg)

concentration gradients are responsible for the ionic current. To a first approximation, the permeation of ions through most channel proteins behaves as though the flow of these ions follows a model based on the Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion theory, which was first applied to the diffusion of ions in simple solutions. This theory leads to an important equation in medical physiology called the constant-field equation, which predicts how $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ will respond to changes in ion concentration gradients or membrane permeability. Before introducing this equation, we first consider some important underlying concepts and assumptions.

Without knowing the molecular basis for ion movement through the membrane, we can treat the membrane as a "black box" characterized by a few fundamental parameters (Fig. 6-6). We must assume that the rate of ion movement through the membrane depends on (1) the external and internal concentrations of the ion $\mathrm{X}([\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}$, respectively), (2) the transmembrane voltage $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, and (3) a permeability coefficient for the ion $\mathrm{X}\left(P_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$. In addition, we make four major assumptions about how the ion X behaves in the membrane:

1. The membrane is a homogeneous medium with a thickness $a$.
2. The voltage difference varies linearly with distance across the membrane (see Fig. 6-6). This assumption is equivalent to stating that the electric field-that is, the change in voltage with distance-is constant (5) N6-2 throughout the thickness of the membrane. This requirement is therefore called the constant-field assumption.
3. The movement of an ion through the membrane is independent of the movement of any other ions. This assumption is called the independence principle.
4. The permeability coefficient $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ is a constant (i.e., it does not vary with the chemical or electrical driving forces). $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ (units: centimeters per second) is defined as $P_{\mathrm{X}}=$ $D_{\mathrm{X}} \beta / a . D_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the diffusion coefficient for the ion in the membrane, $\beta$ is the membrane/water partition coefficient
for the ion, and $a$ is the thickness of the membrane. Thus, $P_{\mathrm{X}}$ describes the ability of an ion to dissolve in the membrane (as described by $\beta$ ) and diffuse from one side to the other (as described by $D_{\mathrm{X}}$ ) over the distance $a$.

With these assumptions, we can calculate the current carried by a single ion $\mathrm{X}\left(I_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ through the membrane by using the basic physical laws that govern (1) the movement of molecules in solution (Fick's law of diffusion; see Equation 5-13), (2) the movement of charged particles in an electric field (electrophoresis), and (3) the direct proportionality of current to voltage (Ohm's law). The result is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation, named after the pioneering electrophysiologists who applied the constantfield assumption to Nernst-Planck electrodiffusion:

$$
I_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{z^{2} F^{2} V_{\mathrm{m}} P_{\mathrm{X}}}{R T}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{i}}-[\mathrm{X}]_{\mathrm{o}} e^{\left(-z F V_{\mathrm{m}} / R T\right)}}{1-e^{\left(-z F V_{\mathrm{m}} / R T\right)}}\right)
$$

$I_{\mathrm{X}}$, or the rate of ions moving through the membrane, has the same units as electrical current: amperes (coulombs per second). (5) N6-7 Thus, the GHK current equation relates the current of ion X through the membrane to the internal and external concentrations of X , the transmembrane voltage, and the permeability of the membrane to X . The GHK equation thus allows us to predict how the current carried by X depends on $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. This current-voltage (I-V) relationship is important for understanding how ionic currents flow into and out of cells.

Figure 6-7A shows how the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ depends on $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, as predicted by Equation 6-7 for the normal internal $(155-\mathrm{mM})$ and external $(4.5-\mathrm{mM})$ concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. By convention, a current of ions flowing into the cell (inward current) is defined in electrophysiology as a negativegoing current, and a current flowing out of the cell (outward current) is defined as a positive current. (As in physics, the direction of current is always the direction of movement of positive charge. This convention means that an inward flow of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is an outward current.) For the case of $155 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}^{+}$ inside the cell and $4.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}^{+}$outside the cell, an inward current is predicted at voltages that are more negative than -95 mV and an outward current is predicted at voltages that are more positive than -95 mV (see Fig. 6-7A). The value of -95 mV is called the reversal potential $\left(V_{\text {rev }}\right)$, because it is precisely at this voltage that the direction of current reverses (i.e., the net current equals zero). If we set $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ equal to zero in Equation 6-7 and solve for $V_{\text {rev }}$, we find that the GHK current equation reduces to the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Equation 6-5). Thus, the GHK current equation for an ion X predicts a reversal potential $\left(V_{\text {rev }}\right)$ equal to the Nernst potential $\left(E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ for that ion; that is, the current is zero when the ion is in electrochemical equilibrium. At $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values more negative than $V_{\mathrm{rev}}$, the net driving force on a cation is inward; at voltages that are more positive than $V_{\text {rev }}$, the net driving force is outward. (5) N6-8

Figure 6-7B shows the analogous $I-V$ relationship predicted by Equation 6-7 for physiological concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In this case, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ is inward at $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values more negative than $V_{\text {rev }}(+67 \mathrm{mV})$ and outward at voltages that are more positive than this reversal potential. Here again, $V_{\text {rev }}$ is the same as the Nernst potential, in this case, $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$.

# N6-7 Calculating an Ionic Current from an Ionic Flow 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

On page 147 of the text, we pointed out that the current carried by ion $X$ through the membrane $\left(I_{0}\right)$ has the units of amperes, which is the same as coulombs per second (the coulomb is the fundamental unit of charge). In order to compute how many moles per second of $X$ are passing through the membrane, we need to convert from coulombs to moles. We can compute a macroscopic quantity of charge by using a conversion factor called the Faraday ( $F$ ). The Faraday is the charge (in coulombs) of a mole of univalent ions. Put another way, $F$ is the product of the elementary charge ( $e_{0}$; see p. 141) and Avogadro's number:

| The | Elementary | Avogadro's |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Faraday | charge | number |
| $F=$ | $e_{0}$ | $\times \quad N_{0}$ |
| $=\left(1.6022 \times 10^{-19}\right.$ coulombs/electron) |  |  |
| $\times\left(6.022 \times 10^{23}\right.$ electrons/mole) |  |  |
| $=96,484$ coulombs/mole |  |  |

Thus, given an ionic current, we can easily compute the flow of the ion:

$$
I_{K}=F(\text { flow of ion } \mathrm{X})
$$

## N6-8 Shape of the I-V Relationship

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

In the text, we introduced the GHK current equation as Equation 6-7 (shown here as Equation NE 6-8):

$$
I_{K}=\frac{z^{2} F^{2} V_{\infty} P_{X}}{R T}\left(\frac{[\mathrm{X}]_{i}-[\mathrm{X}]_{0} e^{i-z F V_{\infty} / R T)}}{1-e^{i-z F V_{\infty} / R T}}\right)
$$

(NE 6-8)
In the nonphysiological case in which $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{0}$ are equal to $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, the above equation reduces to

$$
I_{K}=\frac{z^{2} F^{2} V_{\infty} P_{X}}{R T}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]
$$

(NE 6-9)
In this case, the relationship between the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current $\left(I_{0}\right)$ and $V_{\infty}$ should be a straight line that passes through the origin, as shown by the dashed line in Figure 6-7A.

Similarly, in the nonphysiological case in which $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{0}$ are equal to $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, the GHK current equation reduces to

$$
I_{\mathrm{Na}}=\frac{z^{2} F^{2} V_{\infty} P_{X}}{R T}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]
$$

Again, the preceding equation predicts that the relationship between the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ and $V_{\infty}$ also should be a straight line, as shown by the dashed line in Figure 6-7B in the text. These relationships are "ohmic" because they follow Ohm's law: $\Delta I=$ $\Delta V / R$. N6-31 where $R$ in this equation represents resistance. Thus, the slope of the line is $1 / R$ or the conductance:

$$
\text { Current }=\text { Conductance } \times \text { Voltage } \quad \text { (NE 6-11) }
$$

Comparing the above equation with the two that precede it, we see that-for the special case in which the ion concentrations ([X]) are identical on both sides of the membrane-the conductance is

$$
\frac{z^{2} F^{2} P_{X}}{R T}[\mathrm{X}]
$$

(NE 6-12)
Thus, according to the GHK current equation, the membrane's conductance to an ion is proportional to the membrane's permeability and also depends on ion concentration.

What does the GHK current equation predict for more realistic examples in which $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, greatly exceeds $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{0}$, or $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, is much lower than $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{0}$ ? The solid curve in Figure 6-7A in the text is the prediction of the GHK current equation for the normal internal $(155 \mathrm{mM})$ and external $(4.5 \mathrm{mM})$ concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. By convention, a current of ions flowing into the cell (inward current)
is defined in electrophysiology as a negative-going current, and a current flowing out of the cell (outward current) is defined as a positive current. (As in physics, the direction of current is always the direction of movement of positive charge. This means that an inward flow of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is an outward current.) The nonlinear behavior of the I-V relationship in Figure 6-7A in the text is solely due to the asymmetric internal and external concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is more concentrated inside than outside, the outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents will tend to be larger than the inward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents. That is, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current will tend to exhibit outward rectification, as shown by the solid I-V curve in Figure 6-7A. Such I-V rectification is known as Goldman rectification. It is due solely to asymmetric ion concentrations and does not reflect an asymmetric behavior of the channels through which the ion moves.

For the case of $155 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}^{+}$inside the cell and $4.5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{K}^{+}$ outside the cell, the GHK current equation predicts an inward current at voltages more negative than -95 mV and an outward current for voltages more positive than -95 mV . The value of -95 mV is called the reversal potential $\left(V_{\infty}\right)$ because it is precisely at this voltage that the direction of current reverses (i.e., the net current equals zero). If we set $I_{0}$ equal to zero in the GHK current equation and solve for $V_{\infty}$, we find that this rather complicated equation reduces to the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Equation 6-5 in the text, shown here as Equation NE 6-13):

$$
E_{K}=\left(-58.1 \mathrm{mV} / \log _{10} \frac{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{0}}{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{0}}\right.
$$

Thus, the GHK current equation for an ion $X$ predicts a reversal potential $\left(V_{\infty}\right)$ equal to the Nernst potential $\left(E_{0}\right)$ for that ion; that is, the current is zero when the ion is in electrochemical equilibrium. At voltages more negative than $V_{\infty}$, the net driving force on a cation is inward; at voltages more positive than $V_{\infty}$, the net driving force is outward.

Figure 6-7B in the text shows a similar treatment for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Again, the dashed line that passes through the origin refers to the artificial situation in which $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{0}$ are each equal to 145 mM . This line describes an ohmic relationship. The solid curve in Figure 6-7B shows the I-V relationship for a physiological set of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations: $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{0}=145 \mathrm{mM},\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]=12 \mathrm{mM}$. The relationship is nonlinear solely because of the asymmetric internal and external concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is more concentrated outside than inside, the inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents will tend to be larger than the outward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents. That is, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current will tend to exhibit inward rectification. Again, such I-V rectification is known as Goldman rectification.

# N6-31 Ohmic I-V Curve 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

According to Ohm's law $(I=V / R)$, the $I-V$ relationship is a straight line if $1 / R$ (i.e., the conductance) is constant. The slope is positive. For a simple electrical circuit consisting of a resistor and a voltage source, the line passes through the origin (i.e., $I=0$ when $V=0$ ). However, if the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ were ohmic (i.e., we assume that the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is the same on both sides of the membrane), $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is zero when the driving force $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ is zero (see Equation 7-2 on p. 180 of the text). Therefore, the $I-V$ plot for an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current passes through the $x$-axis at the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$.

In real-life situations, the $I-V$ curve for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents is much more complicated, following the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation, as discussed in $\mathbf{3}$ N6-II.

A, The solid curve is the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current predicted from the GHK equation (see Equation 6-7)—assuming that the membrane is perfectly selective for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$—for a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 155 mM and a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ of 4.5 mM . The dashed line represents the current that would be expected if both $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ were 155 mM (Ohm's law). B, The solid curve is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current predicted from the GHK equation—assuming that the membrane is perfectly selective for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$—for an $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 12 mM and an $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ of 145 mM . The dashed line represents the current that would be expected if both $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ were 145 mM .

## Membrane potential depends on ionic concentration gradients and permeabilities

In the preceding section, we discussed how to use the GHK current equation to predict the current carried by any single ion, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. If the membrane is permeable to the monovalent ions $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-and only to these ionsthe total ionic current carried by these ions across the membrane is the sum of the individual ionic currents:

$$
I_{\text {total }}=I_{\mathrm{K}}+I_{\mathrm{Na}}+I_{\mathrm{Cl}}
$$

The individual ionic currents given by Equation 6-7 can be substituted into the right-hand side of Equation 6-8. Note that for the sake of simplicity, we have not considered currents carried by electrogenic pumps or other ion transporters; we could have added extra "current" terms for such electrogenic transporters. At the resting membrane potential (i.e., $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is equal to $V_{\mathrm{rev}}$ ), the sum of all ion currents is zero (i.e., $I_{\text {total }}=0$ ). When we set $I_{\text {total }}$ to zero in the expanded Equation 6-8 and solve for $V_{\text {rev }}$, we get an expression known as the GHK voltage equation or the constant-field equation:

$$
V_{\mathrm{rev}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{K}}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Cl}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{P_{\mathrm{K}}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+P_{\mathrm{Cl}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)
$$

Because we derived Equation 6-9 for the case of $I_{\text {total }}=0$, it is valid only when zero net current is flowing across the membrane. This zero net current flow is the steady-state condition that exists for the cellular resting potential, that is, when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ equals $V_{\text {rev }}$. The logarithmic term of Equation 6-9 indicates that resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ depends on the concentration gradients and the permeabilities of the various ions. However,
resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ depends primarily on the concentrations of the most permeant ion. (5) N6-9

The principles underlying Equation 6-9 show why the plot of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ versus $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ in Figure 6-4-which summarizes data obtained from a frog muscle cell-bends away from the idealized Nernst slope at very low values of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$. Imagine that we expose a mammalian muscle cell to a range of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ values, always substituting extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, or vice versa, so that the sum of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is kept fixed at its physiological value of $4.5+145=149.5 \mathrm{mM}$. To simplify matters, we assume that the membrane permeability to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is very small (i.e., $P_{\mathrm{Cl}} \cong 0$ ). We can also rearrange Equation 6-9 by dividing the numerator and denominator by $P_{\mathrm{K}}$ and representing the ratio $P_{\mathrm{Na}} / P_{\mathrm{K}}$ as $\alpha$. At $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, this simplified equation becomes

$$
V_{\mathrm{rev}}=(61.5 \mathrm{mV}) \times \log _{10}\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+\alpha\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+\alpha\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)
$$

Figure 6-8 shows that when $\alpha$ is zero-that is, when the membrane is impermeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-Equation 6-10 reduces to the Nernst equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Equation 6-4), and the plot of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ versus the logarithm of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is linear. If we choose an $\alpha$ of 0.01 , however, the plot bends away from the ideal at low $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ values. This bend reflects the introduction of a slight permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. As we increase this $P_{\mathrm{Na}}$ further by increasing $\alpha$ to 0.03 and 0.1 , the curvature becomes even more pronounced. Thus, as predicted by Equation 6-10, increasing the permeability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$relative to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$tends to shift $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a positive direction, toward $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$. In some skeletal muscle cells, an $\alpha$ of 0.01 best explains the experimental data.

The constant-field equation (see Equation 6-9) and simplified relationships derived from it (e.g., Equation 6-10)

In the text, we introduced Equation 6-9 (shown here as Equation NE 6-14)

$$

and pointed out that the resting $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ depends mostly on the concentrations of the most permeant ion. This last statement is only true on the condition that the most permeant ion is also present at a reasonable concentration. It would be more precise to state that $V_{\text {in }}$ depends on a series of permeabilityconcentration products. Thus, an ion contributes to $V_{\text {in }}$ to the extent that its permeability-concentration product dominates the above equation. An interesting example is the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ion, which we omit from Equation NE 6-14. Although its permeability $P_{\mathrm{H}}$ may be quite high in some cells, $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentrations on both sides of the membrane are usually extremely low (at a pH of $7,\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ ). Thus, even though $P_{\mathrm{H}}$ may be large, the product $P_{\mathrm{H}} \times\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is usually negligibly small, so that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ usually does not contribute noticeably to $V_{\text {in }}$ via a $P_{\mathrm{H}} \times\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ term, which is why we omitted it from the above equation.

The blue line describes the instance in which there is no $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability (i.e., $P_{\mathrm{Na}} / P_{\mathrm{k}}=0$ ). The three orange curves describe the $V_{\mathrm{o}}$ predicted by Equation 6-10 for three values of $\alpha$ greater than zero and assumed values of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}},\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ for skeletal muscles, as listed in Table 6-1. The deviation of these orange curves from linearity is greater at low values of $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$, where the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is relatively larger.
show that steady-state $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ depends on the concentrations of all permeant ions, weighted according to their relative permeabilities. Another very useful application of the constantfield equation is determination of the ionic selectivity of channels. For example, when $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is in the normal range, a particular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in human cardiac myocytes (i.e., the TWIK-1 K2P channel introduced below in Table 6-2 and Fig. 6-20F) has an extremely low $\alpha$-as we could calculate from $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$, and the ion concentrations using Equation 6-10. However, under conditions of hypokalemia (plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]<$ $3.5 \mathrm{mM}), \alpha$ becomes substantially larger, which causes a depolarization that can trigger cardiac arrhythmias that may lead to cardiac arrest and sudden death. (5) N6-10

In general, the resting potential of most vertebrate cells is dominated by high permeability to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, which accounts for the observation that the resting $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ is typically close to $E_{\mathrm{K}}$. The resting permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is normally very low. Skeletal muscle cells, cardiac cells, and neurons typically have resting membrane potentials ranging from -60 to -90 mV . As discussed in Chapter 7, excitable cells generate action potentials by transiently increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability and thus driving $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ in a positive direction toward $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ or $E_{\mathrm{Ca}}$. A few cells, such as vertebrate skeletal muscle fibers, have high permeability to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, which therefore contributes to the resting $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$. This high permeability also explains why the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$equilibrium potential in skeletal muscle is essentially equivalent to the resting potential (see Table 6-1).

## ELECTRICAL MODEL OF A CELL MEMBRANE

## The cell membrane model includes various ionic conductances and electromotive forces in parallel with a capacitor

The current carried by a particular ion varies with membrane voltage, as described by the $I-V$ relationship for that ion (e.g., Fig. 6-7). This observation suggests that the contribution of each ion to the electrical properties of the cell membrane
may be represented by elements of an electrical circuit. The various ionic gradients across the membrane provide a form of stored electrical energy, much like that of a battery. In physics, the voltage source of a battery is known as an emf (electromotive force). The equilibrium potential of a given ion can be considered an emf for that ion. Each of these batteries produces its own ionic current across the membrane, and the sum of these individual ionic currents is the total ionic current (see Equation 6-8). According to Ohm's law, the emf or voltage $(V)$ and current $(I)$ are related directly to each other by the resistance $(\boldsymbol{R})$-or inversely to the reciprocal of resistance, conductance $(\boldsymbol{G})$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
V & =I R \quad \text { Ohm's law } \\
& =I / G
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the slopes of the theoretical curves in Figure 6-7 represent conductances because $I=G V$. In a membrane, we can represent each ionic permeability pathway with an electrical conductance. Ions with high permeability or conductance move via a low-resistance pathway; ions with low permeability move via a high-resistance pathway. For cell membranes, $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ is measured in millivolts, membrane current $\left(I_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ is given in amperes per square centimeter of membrane area, and membrane resistance $\left(R_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ has the units of ohms $\times$ square centimeter. Membrane conductance $\left(G_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, the reciprocal of membrane resistance, is thus measured in units of ohms ${ }^{-1}$ (or siemens) per square centimeter. (5) N6-11

Currents of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$generally flow across the cell membrane via distinct pathways. At the molecular level, these pathways correspond to specific types of ion channel proteins (Fig. 6-9A). It is helpful to model the electrical behavior of cell membranes by a circuit diagram (see Fig. 6-9B). The electrical current carried by each ion flows via a separate parallel branch of the circuit that is under the control of a variable resistor and an emf. For instance, the variable resistor for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$represents the conductance provided by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the membrane $\left(G_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$. The emf for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$corresponds to $E_{\mathrm{K}}$. Similar parallel branches of the circuit in Figure 6-9B represent the other physiologically important ions. Each ion provides a component of the total conductance of the membrane, so $G_{\mathrm{K}}+G_{\mathrm{Na}}+G_{\mathrm{Ca}}+G_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ sum to $G_{\mathrm{m}}$.

The GHK voltage equation (see Equation 6-9) predicts steady-state $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$, provided the underlying assumptions are valid. We can also predict steady-state $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ (i.e., when the net current across the membrane is zero) with another, more general equation that assumes channels behave like separate ohmic conductances:

$$
V_{\mathrm{m}}=\frac{G_{\mathrm{K}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{K}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Na}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Na}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Ca}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Ca}}+\frac{G_{\mathrm{Cl}}}{G_{\mathrm{m}}} E_{\mathrm{Cl}} \ldots
$$

Thus, $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ is the sum of equilibrium potentials $\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$, each weighted by the ion's fractional conductance (e.g., $G_{\mathrm{K}} / G_{\mathrm{m}}$ ).

One more parallel element, a capacitor, is needed to complete our model of the cell membrane as an electrical circuit. A capacitor is a device that is capable of storing separated charge. Because the lipid bilayer can maintain a separation of charge (i.e., a voltage) across its $\sim 4-\mathrm{nm}$ width, it effectively

## N6-10 Role of TWIK-1 Channels in Cardiac Arrhythmias

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

As noted in the text, the resting $V_{m}$ of many cells, particularly muscle cells and neurons, is dominated by high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability due to certain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that are spontaneously open at negative membrane potentials. Maintaining $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in a predominantly closed state is an important aspect of cellular physiology since the transient opening of these channels allows their efficient function in membrane signaling processes dependent on intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Thus, in typical excitable cells we would expect $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels to maintain a negative $V_{m}$, close to $E_{k}$, except when $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are stimulated to open and trigger activation of cellular processes such as muscle contraction or secretion.

The human genome includes 79 genes that encode $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, comprising five major families of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selectivechannel proteins (see Table 6-2):

- Voltage-gated (Kv)
- Small-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated (SK and IK)
- Large-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated (BK)
- Inward rectifier (Kir)
- Two-pore (K2P)

Of these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, only the Kir and K2P channels show gating behavior compatible with significant open-state probability at negative $V_{m}$. Thus, these latter channels are expected to have the greatest role in determining the resting $V_{m}$.

Because the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that have been studied most extensively appear to conduct very little inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current under physiological conditions, it is not entirely clear why $V_{m}$ deviates from strict Nernst behavior in experiments such as that for which results are shown in Figure 6-4, where the measured $V_{m}$ is more positive than expected at low extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. It has often been assumed that this deviation is simply due to a low but finite permeability of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(e.g., $\alpha \cong 0.01$ in Equation 6-10) or an unspecified $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$leak. However, structural and biophysical studies of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel proteins (1) N7-13 indicate that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$binding to the ionselectivity filter actually stabilizes the filter in a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selective conformation. When $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration is reduced to lowmillimolar levels, the selectivity filter may deform and permit other ions such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to permeate the channel. Thus, at low extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration it is possible that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in cell membranes could become less selective for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ relative to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

An example of this effect has been described in human cardiac myocytes, in which pathological conditions of blood hypokalemia (plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]<3 \mathrm{mM}$ ) may lead to paradoxical depolarization, cardiac arrhythmia, and sudden death. Evidence suggests that this phenomenon may be caused by a certain K2P $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel called TWIK-1 (human gene KCNK1) that exhibits increased permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$at low extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Serum hypokalemia can be secondary to diuretic therapy, diarrhea (including laxative abuse) or vomiting, or starvation. Plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration should be raised to normal levels of 3.5 to 4.8 mM to prevent dangerous cardiac arrhythmia in such instances.

functions as a capacitor. In physics, a capacitor that is formed by two parallel plates separated by a distance $a$ can be represented by the diagram in Figure 6-9C. When the capacitor is charged, one of the plates bears a charge of $+Q$ and the other plate has a charge of $-Q$. 06-12 Such a capacitor
maintains a potential difference $(V)$ between the plates. Capacitance (C) is the magnitude of the charge stored per unit potential difference:

$$
C=\frac{Q}{V}
$$

Capacitance is measured in units of farads (F); (0) N6-11 1 farad $=1$ coulomb/volt. For the particular geometry of the parallel-plate capacitor in Figure 6-9C, capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area $(A)$ of one side of a plate, to the relative permittivity (dielectric constant) of the medium between the two plates $\left(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}\right)$, and to the vacuum permittivity constant $\left(\varepsilon_{0}\right)$, and it is inversely proportional to the distance (a) separating the plates.

$$
C=\frac{A \varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}} \varepsilon_{0}}{a}
$$

Because of its similar geometry, the cell membrane has a capacitance that is analogous to that of the parallel-plate capacitor. The capacitance of $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of most cell membranes is $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~F}$; that is, most membranes have a specific capacitance of $1 \mu \mathrm{~F} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. We can use Equation 6-14 to estimate the thickness of the membrane. If we assume that the average dielectric constant of a biological membrane is $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{r}}=5$ (slightly greater than the value of 2 for pure hydrocarbon), Equation $6-14$ gives a value of 4.4 nm for $a$-that is, the thickness of the membrane. This value is quite close to estimates of membrane thickness that have been obtained by other physical techniques.

## The separation of relatively few charges across the bilayer capacitance maintains the membrane potential

We can also use the capacitance of the cell membrane to estimate the amount of charge that the membrane actually separates in generating a typical membrane potential. For example, consider a spherical cell with a diameter of $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ of 100 mM . This cell needs to lose only $0.004 \%$ of its $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to charge the capacitance of the membrane to a voltage of -61.5 mV . (1) N6-13 This small loss of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is clearly insignificant in comparison with a cell's total ionic composition and does not significantly perturb concentration gradients. In general, cell membrane potentials are sustained by a very small separation of charge.

Because of the existence of membrane capacitance, total membrane current has two components (see Fig. 6-9), one carried by ions through channels, and the other carried by ions as they charge the membrane capacitance.

## Ionic current is directly proportional to the electrochemical driving force (Ohm's law)

Figure 6-10 compares the equilibrium potentials for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$with a resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of -80 mV . In our discussion of Figure 6-7, we saw that $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ or $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ becomes zero when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ equals the reversal potential, which is the same as the $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ or emf for that ion. When $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more negative than $E_{\mathrm{X}}$, the current is negative or inward, whereas when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more positive than $E_{\mathrm{X}}$, the current is positive or outward. Thus, the ionic current depends on the difference between the actual $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $E_{\mathrm{X}}$. In fact, the ionic current through a given

## N6-13 Charge Separation Required to Generate the Membrane Potential

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

To generate a membrane potential, there must be a tiny separation of charge across the membrane. How large is that charge? Imagine that we have a spherical cell with a diameter of $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. If $\left[K^{+}\right]_{0}$ is 100 mM and $\left[K^{+}\right]_{0}$ is 10 mM , the $V_{m}$ according to the Nernst equation would be -61.5 mV (or -0.0615 V ) for a perfectly $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selective membrane at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the charge $(Q)$ on $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of the "plates" of the membrane capacitor? We assume that the specific capacitance is $1 \mu \mathrm{~F} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. From Equation 6-13 on page 150 in the text, we know that

$$
O=C V
$$

(NE 6-16)
where $O$ is measured in coulombs (C), $C$ is in farads ( $F$ ), and $V$ is in volts (V). Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
O & =\left(1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right) \times(0.0615 \mathrm{~V}) \\
& =61.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The Faraday is the charge of 1 mole of univalent ions-or 96,480 C. (T) N6-12 To determine how many moles of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$we need to separate in order to achieve an electrical charge of 61.5 $\times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ (i.e., the $O$ in the previous equation), we merely divide $O$ by the Faraday. Because $V_{m}$ is negative, the cell needs to lose $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.
$\mathrm{K}^{+}$deficit per $\mathrm{cm}^{2}$ of membrane $=\frac{\left(\frac{61.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{~cm}^{2}}\right)}{\left(\frac{96,480 \mathrm{C}}{\text { mole }}\right)}$
(NE 6-18)

$$
=6.37 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles } \mathrm{cm}^{-2}
$$

The surface area for a spherical cell with a diameter of $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ is $3.14 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Total } \mathrm{K}^{+} \text {deficit per cell } & =\frac{6.37 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles }}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \times \frac{3.14 \times 10^{-8} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}}{1} \\
& =2.0 \times 10^{-18} \text { moles }
\end{aligned}
$$

The volume of this cell is $0.52 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~L}$. Given a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{0}$ of 100 mM ,
Total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content of cell $=(0.1 \mathrm{mole} / \mathrm{L}) \times\left(0.52 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~L}\right)$

$$
=0.52 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles }
$$

(NE 6-19)

What fraction of the cell's total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content represents the charge separated by the membrane?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Fraction of cell } \mathrm{K}^{+} & =\frac{\mathrm{K}^{+} \text {deficit of cell }}{\text { Total } \mathrm{K}^{+} \text {content of cell }} \\
& =\frac{2.0 \times 10^{-18} \text { moles }}{0.52 \times 10^{-12} \text { moles }} \\
& =4 \times 10^{-5} \text { or } 0.004 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, in the process of generating a $V_{m}$ of -61.5 mV , our hypothetical cell needs to lose only $0.004 \%$ of its total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content to charge the capacitance of the cell membrane.

Figure 6-10 Electrochemical driving forces acting on various ions. For each ion, we represent the equilibrium potential (e.g., $E_{\mathrm{Na}}=+67 \mathrm{mV}$ ) as a horizontal bar and the net driving force for the ion (e.g., $V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{Na}}=$ -147 mV ) as an arrow, assuming a resting potential $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ of -80 mV . The values for the equilibrium potentials are those for mammalian skeletal muscle given in Table 6-1, as well as a typical value for $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ in a nonmuscle cell. N6-29
conductance pathway is proportional to the difference $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right.$ $-E_{\mathrm{X}}$ ), and the proportionality constant is the ionic conductance $\left(G_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ :

$$
I_{\mathrm{X}}=G_{\mathrm{X}}\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)
$$

This equation simply restates Ohm's law (see Equation 6-11). The term $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ is often referred to as the driving force in electrophysiology. In our electrical model of the cell membrane (see Fig. 6-9), this driving force is represented by the difference between $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ and the emf of the battery. The larger the driving force, the larger the observed current. Returning to the $I-V$ relationship for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in Figure 6-7A, when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more positive than $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the driving force is positive, producing an outward (i.e., positive) current. Conversely, at $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values more negative than $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the negative driving force produces an inward current. (5) N6-14

In Figure 6-10, the arrows represent the magnitudes and directions of the driving forces for the various ions. For a typical value of the resting potential ( -80 mV ), the driving force on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is the largest of the four ions, followed by the driving force on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In both cases, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more negative than the equilibrium potential and thus draws the positive ion into the cell. The driving force on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is small. $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more positive than $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ and thus pushes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out of the cell. In muscle, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is slightly more positive than $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ and thus draws the anion inward. In most other cells, however, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is more negative than $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ and pushes the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$out.

## Capacitative current is proportional to the rate of voltage change

The idea that ionic channels can be thought of as conductance elements $\left(G_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ and that ionic current $\left(I_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ is proportional to driving force $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ provides a framework for understanding the electrical behavior of cell membranes. Current carried by inorganic ions flows through open channels according to the principles of electrodiffusion and Ohm's law, as explained above. However, when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is changing-as it does during an action potential-another current due to the membrane capacitance also shapes the electrical responses of cells. This current, which flows only while $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is changing, is called the capacitative current. How does a capacitor produce a current? When voltage across a capacitor changes, the capacitor either gains or loses charge. This movement of charge onto or off the capacitor is an electrical (i.e., the capacitative) current.

The simple membrane circuit of Figure 6-11A, which is composed of a capacitor $\left(C_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ in parallel with a resistor $\left(R_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ and a switch, can help illustrate how capacitative currents arise. Assume that the switch is open and that the capacitor is initially charged to a voltage of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ which causes a separation of charge $(Q)$ across the capacitor. According to the definition of capacitance (see Equation 6-13), the charge stored by the capacitor is a product of capacitance and voltage.

$$
Q=C_{\mathrm{m}} V_{0}
$$

As long as the switch in the circuit remains open, the capacitor maintains this charge. However, when the switch is closed, the charge on the capacitor discharges through the resistor, and the voltage difference between the circuit points labeled "In" and "Out" in Figure 6-11A decays from $V_{0}$ to a final value of zero (see Fig. 6-11B). This voltage decay follows an exponential time course. The time required for the voltage to fall to $37 \%$ of its initial value is a characteristic parameter called the time constant $(\tau)$, which has units of time: (5) N6-15

$$
\tau=R_{\mathrm{m}} \cdot C_{\mathrm{m}}
$$

Thus, the time course of the decay in voltage is

$$
V=V_{0} e^{-t / B C}
$$

Figure 6-11C shows that the capacitative current $\left(I_{\mathrm{C}}\right)$ is zero before the switch is closed, when the voltage is stable at $V_{0}$. When we close the switch, charge begins to flow rapidly off the capacitor, and the magnitude of $I_{\mathrm{C}}$ is maximal. As the charge on the capacitor gradually falls, the rate at which charge flows off the capacitor gradually falls as well until $I_{\mathrm{C}}$ is zero at "infinite" time. Note, however, that $V$ and $I_{\mathrm{C}}$ relax with the same time constant. (5) N6-16

In Figure 6-11, current and voltage change freely. Figure $6-12$ shows two related examples in which either current or voltage is abruptly changed to a fixed value, held constant for a certain time, and returned to the original value. This pattern is called a square pulse. In Figure 6-12A, we control, or "clamp," the current and allow the voltage to follow. When

## N6-14 Conductance Varies with Driving Force

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

In (5) N6-8, we pointed out that when $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{+}=\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{m}$, the $I-V$ relationship for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents is linear and passes through the origin (see dashed line in Fig 6-7A). In this special case, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance $\left(G_{K}\right)$ is simply the slope of the line because, according to Ohm's law, $I_{\mathrm{K}}=G_{\mathrm{K}} \times V_{\mathrm{m}}$. In other words, $G_{\mathrm{K}}=\Delta I_{\mathrm{K}} / \Delta V_{\mathrm{m}}$.

In webnote Equation NE 6-8, we also pointed out that when $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ does not equal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{m}}$, the $I-V$ relationship is curvilinear (see solid curve in Fig. 6-7A in the text) as described by the GHK current equation for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$:

$$
I_{\mathrm{K}}=\frac{z^{2} F^{2} V_{\mathrm{m}} P_{\mathrm{K}}}{R T}\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]-\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{0} e^{(-z F V_{\mathrm{m}} / R T)}}{1-e^{(-z F V_{\mathrm{m}} / R T)}}\right) \quad(\mathbf{N E} 6-21)
$$

The above equation is identical to Equation 6-7 in the text, but with $\mathrm{K}^{+}$replacing the generic ion X . Note that for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, all of the $z$ values are +1 .

Because slope conductance for $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(G_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ is the change in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ divided by the change in membrane voltage $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, we could in principle derive an equation for $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ by taking the derivative of Equation NE 6-21 with respect to $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ (i.e., $G_{\mathrm{K}}=$ $d I_{\mathrm{K}} / d V_{\mathrm{m}}$ ). Because $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ appears three times in Equation NE 6-21 (and twice in an exponent), this derivative-that is, $G_{\mathrm{K}}$-turns out to be extremely complicated (not shown). Nevertheless, it is possible to show that, in general, $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ increases with increasing values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. For the special case in which $V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the equation for $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ simplifies to

$$
\left(\frac{d I_{\mathrm{K}}}{d V_{\mathrm{m}}}\right)_{V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{K}}}=G_{\mathrm{K}}=-\frac{z^{2} F^{2} P_{\mathrm{K}}}{R^{2} T^{2}} V_{\mathrm{m}}\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{0} \times\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}}{\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{0}-\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}}\right) \quad(\mathbf{N E} 6-22)
$$

It is clear from Equation NE 6-22 that $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ increases as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes more positive. However, this relationship is not linear because as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ increases, $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ (the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) must also increase, and thus the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ or the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ terms in Equation NE 6-22 must also change.

Equation NE 6-22 describes $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ at exactly one point—when $V_{\mathrm{m}}=E_{\mathrm{K}}$ at -95 mV . At other values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, the appropriate expression for $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ is far more complicated than Equation NE 6-22. Nevertheless, it is clear from the graph in Figure 6-7A that the slope of the $I-V$ relationship (i.e., $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ ) increases with $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Thus, the slope of the curve in Figure 6-7A is relatively shallow (i.e., low $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ ) for the inward currents at relatively negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values (lower portion of the plot) and steeper (i.e., high $G_{\mathrm{K}}$ ) for outward currents at more positive $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values (upper portion of the plot).

## N6-15 Units of the "Time Constant"

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As described in Equation 6-17 in the text (shown here as Equation NE 6-23), the time constant ( $t$ ) is

$$
\tau=R \cdot C
$$

where $R$ is resistance (in ohms) and $C$ is capacitance (in farads). The units of $\tau$ are thus

$$
\tau=R \cdot C=\text { ohm } \cdot \text { farad }
$$

Because an ohm is a volt per ampere, and a farad is a coulomb per volt,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \tau=\frac{\text { volt }}{\text { amp }} \frac{\text { coulomb }}{\text { volt }} \\
& \tau=\frac{\text { coulomb }}{\text { amp }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because electrical current (in amperes) is the number of charges (in coulombs) moving per unit time (in seconds), an ampere is a coulomb per second:

$$
\tau=\frac{\text { coulomb }}{\text { coulomb/s }}=\mathrm{s}
$$

Thus, the unit of the "time constant" is seconds.

# N6-16 Time Constant of Capacitative Current 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

In Figure 6-11 in the text, we saw that closing a switch (panel A) causes the voltage to decline exponentially with a time constant $\tau$ (panel B), and it causes a current to flow maximally at time zero and then to decay with the same time constant as voltage. In other words, the capacitative current flows only while voltage is changing. Why? Current is charge flowing per unit time. Thus, we can obtain the capacitative current $\left(I_{C}\right)$ by taking the derivative of charge (Q) in Equation 6-16 with respect to time:

$$
I_{C}=\frac{d Q}{d t}=C \frac{d V}{d t}
$$

By definition, the derivative of charge with respect to time is current (i.e., $I_{C}=d Q / d t$ ). Thus, if voltage is constant (i.e., $d V / d t=$ 0 ), no capacitative current can flow. In Figure 6-11C, $I_{C}$ is zero before the switch is closed (i.e., before the downward deflection of $I_{C}$ ) and again is zero at "infinite" time, when the voltage is stable at 0 . On the other hand, when the voltage is changing, the above equation indicates that $I_{C}$ is nonzero and is directly proportional to $C$ and to the rate at which the voltage is changing. Note, however, that $V$ and $I_{C}$ relax with the same time constant. To understand the exponential time course, note that Ohm's law can be used to express the current through the resistor in Figure 6-11A as $V / R$. If $V / R$ is substituted for $I_{C}$ in Equation NE 6-27, we have

$$
I_{C}=\frac{V}{R}=C \frac{d V}{d t}
$$

We can rearrange the above differential equation to solve for $V$ :

$$
V=R C \frac{d V}{d t}
$$

(NE 6-29)
We can now solve this differential equation to obtain the time course of the decay in voltage:

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{V}{V_{0}}=e^{-V / R C} \\
V=V_{0} e^{-V / R C}
\end{gathered}
$$

Equation NE 6-30 is the same as Equation 6-18 in the text. Thus, the voltage falls exponentially with time. We now go back to the first equation and plug in our newly derived expression for $V$ :

$$
I_{C}=C \frac{d V}{d t}=C \frac{d}{d t}\left(V_{0} e^{-V / R C}\right)=-\frac{V_{0}}{R} e^{-V / R C}
$$

Thus, the capacitative current decays with the same time constant as does voltage. At time zero, the current is $-V_{0} / R$, and at infinite time the current is zero.

Figure 6-11 Capacitative current through a resistance-capacitance (RC) circuit.
we inject a square pulse of current across the membrane, the voltage changes to a new value with a rounded time course determined by the $R C$ value of the membrane. In Figure $6-12 B$, we clamp voltage and allow the current to follow. When we suddenly change voltage to a new value, a transient capacitative current flows as charge flows onto the capacitor. The capacitative current is maximal at the beginning of the square pulse, when charge flows most rapidly onto the capacitor, and then falls off exponentially with a time constant of $R C$. When we suddenly decrease the voltage to its original value, $I_{C}$ flows in the direction opposite that observed at the beginning of the pulse. Thus, $I_{C}$ appears as brief spikes at the beginning and end of the voltage pulse.

## A voltage clamp measures currents across cell membranes

Electrophysiologists use a technique called voltage clamping to deduce the properties of ion channels. In this method, specialized electronics are used to inject current into the cell to set the membrane voltage to a value that is different from the resting potential. The device then measures the total current required to clamp $V_{m}$ to this value. A typical method of voltage clamping involves impaling a cell with two sharp electrodes, one for monitoring $V_{m}$ and one for injecting the current. Figure 6-13A illustrates how the technique can be used with a Xenopus (i.e., frog) oocyte. (T) N6-17 When the voltage-sensing electrode detects a difference from the intended voltage, called the command voltage, a feedback amplifier rapidly injects opposing current to maintain a constant $V_{m}$. The magnitude of the injected current needed to keep $V_{m}$ constant is equal, but opposite in sign, to the membrane current and is thus an accurate measurement of the total membrane current $\left(I_{m}\right)$.
$I_{m}$ is the sum of the individual currents through each of the parallel branches of the circuit in Figure 6-9B. For a simple case in which only one type of ionic current $\left(I_{\mathrm{S}}\right)$ flows through the membrane, $I_{m}$ is simply the sum of the capacitative current and the ionic current:

## N6-17 Two-Electrode Voltage Clamping

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Historically, the technique of two-electrode voltage clamping was first used to analyze the ionic currents in a preparation known as the perfused squid giant axon. Certain nerve fibers of the squid are so large that their intracellular contents can be extruded and the hollow fiber can be perfused with physiological solutions of various ionic composition. Electrodes in the form of thin wires can be inserted into the axon to clamp the axon membrane potential along its length and measure the current. This technique was used by Alan L. Hodgkin and Andrew F. Huxley in 1952 to deduce the nature of ionic conductance changes that underlie the nerve action potential. For this work, Hodgkin and Huxley shared (with J.C. Eccles) the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. N6-32 The Hodgkin-Huxley analysis is discussed further beginning on page 176.

Another, more recent, application of the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique is called oocyte recording (see Fig. 6-13A). A large oocyte from the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is simultaneously impaled with two micropipette electrodes that serve to clamp the voltage and record current. Native Xenopus oocytes have only small endogenous currents, but they can be induced to express new currents by preinjecting the cell with messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from an isolated gene that codes for an ion channel protein. The oocyte system can therefore be used to characterize the conductance behavior of a relatively pure population of ion channels that are expressed in the plasma membrane after protein translation of the injected mRNA by the oocyte. This approach has proven to be an invaluable assay system for isolating complementary DNA molecules coding for many different types of channels and electrogenic transporters (see Chapter 5). This approach also has become a standard technique used to study the molecular physiology and pharmacology of ion channels.

## N6-30 Voltage and Current Transients due to Membrane Capacitance

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

In panel A of Figure 6-12 in the text (current clamp), we instruct the electronics to suddenly increase the current that we are injecting into the cell and to hold this new current at a constant value. The sudden increase in the current flowing through the membrane causes $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to rise exponentially until we fully charge the membrane capacitance $\left(C_{m}\right)$. Thus, $V_{m}$ rises with a time constant ( N6-15 of $R_{m} \times C_{m}$ ( $R_{m}$ is membrane resistance). At infinite time, the charge on the capacitor is at its maximal value, and all the current flowing through the membrane flows through $R_{m}$, the "ohmic" membrane resistance.

In panel $\mathbf{B}$ of Figure 6-12 in the text (voltage clamp), we instruct the electronics to inject enough current into the cell to suddenly increase in the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ of the cell. The current required to charge the membrane capacitance $\left(C_{m}\right)$ is at first extremely large. However, as we charge the membrane capacitance, that current decays exponentially with a time constant ( N6-15 of $R_{m} \times C_{m}$. At infinite time, the membrane capacitance is fully charged, and no current is required to hold the command voltage. However, this current decays exponentially, with a time course also determined by the $R \times C$ of the membrane.

Figure 6-13 Two-electrode voltage clamp. A, Two microelectrodes impale a Xenopus oocyte. One electrode monitors membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ and the other passes enough current $\left(I_{n}\right)$ through the membrane to clamp $V_{m}$ to a predetermined command voltage ( $V_{\text {command }}$ ). B, In the left panel, the membrane is clamped for 10 ms to a hyperpolarized potential ( 40 mV more negative). Because a hyperpolarization does not activate channels, no ionic currents flow. Only transient capacitative currents flow after the beginning and end of the pulse. In the right panel, the membrane is clamped for 10 ms to a depolarized potential ( 40 mV more positive). Because the depolarization opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, a large inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current flows, in addition to the transient capacitative current. Adding the transient capacitative currents in the left panel to the total current in the right panel cancels the transient capacitative currents $\left(I_{n}\right)$ and yields the pure $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current shown at the bottom in the right panel.

$$
\begin{aligned}
I_{\mathrm{m}} & =\frac{I_{\mathrm{C}}}{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Capacitative } \\
\text { current }
\end{array}}+\frac{I_{\mathrm{X}}}{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Ionic } \\
\text { current }
\end{array}} \\
& =I_{\mathrm{C}}+G_{\mathrm{X}}\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation 6-19 suggests a powerful way to analyze how ionic conductance $\left(G_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ changes with time. For instance, if we abruptly change $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to another value and then hold $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ constant (i.e., we clamp the voltage), the capacitative current flows for only a brief time at the voltage transition and disappears by the time that $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ reaches its new steady value (see Fig. 6-12B). Therefore, after $I_{\mathrm{C}}$ has decayed to zero, any additional changes in $I_{\mathrm{m}}$ must be due to changes in $I_{\mathrm{X}}$. Because $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is clamped and the ion concentrations do not change (i.e., $E_{\mathrm{X}}$ is constant), only one parameter on the right side of Equation 6-19 is left free to vary, $G_{\mathrm{X}}$. In other words, we can directly monitor changes in $G_{\mathrm{X}}$ because this conductance parameter is directly proportional to $I_{\mathrm{m}}$ when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is constant (i.e., clamped).

Figure 6-13B shows examples of records from a typical voltage-clamp experiment on an oocyte expressing voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. In this experiment, a cell membrane is
initially clamped at a resting potential of $-80 \mathrm{mV} . V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is then stepped to -120 mV for 10 ms (a step of -40 mV ) and finally returned to -80 mV . Such a negative-going $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ change is called a hyperpolarization. With this protocol, only brief spikes of current are observed at the beginning and end of the voltage step and are due to the charging of membrane capacitance. No current flows in between these two spikes.

What happens if we rapidly change $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in the opposite direction by shifting the voltage from -80 to -40 mV (a step of +40 mV )? Such a positive-going change in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ from a reference voltage is called a depolarization. In addition to the expected transient capacitative current, a large, inward, time-dependent current flows. This current is an ionic current and is due to the opening and closing kinetics of a particular class of channels called voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, which open only when $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is made sufficiently positive. We can remove the contribution of the capacitative current to the total current by subtracting the inverse of the rapid transient current recorded during the hyperpolarizing pulse of the same magnitude. The remaining slower current is inward (i.e., downward or negative going) and represents $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$, which is directly proportional to $G_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (see Equation 6-19).

The ionic current in Figure 6-13B (lower right panel) is called a macroscopic current because it is due to the activity of a large population of channels sampled from a whole cell. Why did we observe $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current only when we shifted $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ in a positive direction from the resting potential? As described below, such $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are actually members of a large family of voltage-sensitive ion channels that are activated by depolarization. A current activated by depolarization is commonly observed when an electrically excitable cell, such as a neuron, is voltage clamped under conditions in which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is the sole extracellular cation.

A modern electrophysiological method called whole-cell voltage clamping involves the use of a single microelectrode both to monitor $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ and to pass current into the cell. In this method, one presses onto the cell surface a glass micropipette electrode with a smooth, fire-polished tip that is $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter (Fig. 6-14A). Applying slight suction to the inside of the pipette causes a high-resistance seal to form between the circular rim of the pipette tip and the cell membrane. The piece of sealed membrane is called a patch, and the pipette is called a patch pipette. Subsequent application of stronger suction causes the patch to rupture, creating a continuous, low-resistance pathway between the inside of the cell and the pipette. In this configuration, whole-cell currents can be recorded (see Fig. 6-14B). Because single cells can be dissociated from many different tissues and studied in culture, this method has proved very powerful for analyzing the physiological roles of various types of ion channels and their regulation at the cellular level. The approach for recording whole-cell currents with a patch pipette was introduced by Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann, who received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991. No-18

## The patch-clamp technique resolves unitary currents through single channel molecules

Voltage-clamp studies of ionic currents at the whole-cell (i.e., macroscopic) level led to the question of how many channels are involved in the production of a macroscopic current. Electrophysiologists realized that if the area of a voltageclamped membrane was reduced to a very small fraction of the cell surface area, it might be possible to observe the activity of a single channel.

This goal was realized when Neher and Sakmann developed the patch-clamp technique. Applying suction to a patch pipette creates a high-resistance seal between the glass and the cell membrane, as described in the preceding section for whole-cell voltage clamping. However, rather than rupturing the enclosed membrane patch as in the whole-cell approach, one keeps the tiny membrane area within the patch intact and records current from channels within the patch. A current recording made with the patch pipette attached to a cell is called a cell-attached recording (see Fig. 6-14A). After a cell-attached patch is established, it is also possible to withdraw the pipette from the cell membrane to produce an inside-out patch configuration by either of two methods (see Fig. 6-14E and Fig. 6-14F-H). In this configuration, the intracellular surface of the patch membrane faces the bath solution. One can also arrive at the opposite orientation of the patch of membrane by
starting in the cell-attached configuration (see Fig. 6-14A), rupturing the cell-attached patch to produce a whole-cell configuration (see Fig. 6-14B), and then pulling the pipette away from the cell (see Fig. 6-14C). When the membranes reseal, the result is an outside-out patch configuration in which the extracellular patch surface faces the bath solution (see Fig. 6-14D).

The different patch configurations summarized in Figure $6-14$ are useful for studying drug channel interactions, receptor-mediated processes, and biochemical regulatory mechanisms that take place at either the inner or external surface of cell membranes.

## Single channel currents sum to produce macroscopic membrane currents

Figure 6-15 illustrates the results of a patch-clamp experiment that are analogous to the macroscopic experiment results on the right-hand side of Figure 6-13B. Under the diagram of the voltage step in Figure 6-15A are eight current records, each of which is the response to an identical step of depolarization lasting 45 ms . The smallest, nearly rectangular transitions of current correspond to the opening and closing of a single $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. When two or three channels in the patch are open simultaneously, the measured current level is an integral multiple of the single channel or "unitary" transition.

The opening and closing process of ion channels is called gating. Patch-clamp experiments have demonstrated that macroscopic ionic currents represent the gating of single channels that have discrete unitary currents. Averaging consecutive microscopic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current records produces a timedependent current (see Fig. 6-15B) that has the same shape as the macroscopic $I_{\mathrm{ss}}$ shown in Figure 6-13B. If one does the experiment in the same way but blocks $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels with tetrodotoxin, the averaged current is equivalent to the zero current level, which indicates that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are the only channels present within the membrane patch.

Measuring the current from a single channel in a patch at different clamp voltages reveals that the size of the discrete current steps depends on voltage (Fig. 6-16A). Plotting the unitary current (i) of single channels versus the voltage at which they were measured yields a single channel $I-V$ relationship (see Fig. 6-16B) that is similar to the one we discussed above for macroscopic currents (see Fig. 6-7). This single channel $I-V$ relationship reverses direction at a certain potential $\left(V_{\text {rev }}\right)$, just like a macroscopic current does. If a channel is permeable to only one type of ion present in the solution, the $V_{\text {rev }}$ equals the equilibrium potential for that ion $\left(E_{\mathrm{S}}\right)$. However, if the channel is permeable to more than one ion, the single channel reversal potential depends on the relative permeabilities of the various ions, as described by the GHK voltage equation (see Equation 6-9).

The slope of a single channel $I-V$ relationship is a measure of the conductance of a single channel, the unitary conductance (g). Every type of ion channel has a characteristic value of $g$ under a defined set of ionic conditions. The single channel conductance of most known channel proteins is in the range of 1 to 500 picosiemens ( pS ), where 1 pS is equal to $10^{-12} \Omega^{-1}$.

Ann N Y Acad Sci 479:152-161, 1986.)

How do we know that the unitary current in fact corresponds to just a single channel? One good indication is that such conductance measurements are close to the theoretical value expected for ion diffusion through a cylindrical, waterfilled pore that is long enough to span a phospholipid membrane and that has a diameter large enough to accept an ion. The unitary conductance of typical channels corresponds to rates of ion movement in the range of $10^{6}$ to $10^{8}$ ions per second per channel at 100 mV of driving force. These rates of ion transport through single channels are many orders of magnitude greater than typical rates of ion transport by ion pumps ( $\sim 500$ ions/s) or by the fastest ion cotransporters and exchangers ( $\sim 50,000$ ions/s). The high ionic flux through channels places them in a unique class of transport proteins whose unitary activity can be resolved by patch-clamp current recordings.

## Single channels can fluctuate between open and closed states

When a channel has opened from the closed state (zero current) to its full unitary conductance value, the channel is said to be in the open state. Channel gating thus represents the transition between closed and open states. A single channel record is actually a record of the conformational changes of a single protein molecule as monitored by the duration of opening and closing events.

Examination of the consecutive records of a patch recording, such as that in Figure 6-15A, shows that the gating of a single channel is a probabilistic process. On average, there is a certain probability that a channel will open at any given time, but such openings occur randomly. For example, the average record in Figure 6-15B indicates that the probability that the channels will open is highest $\sim 4 \mathrm{~ms}$ after the start of the depolarization.

The process of channel gating can be represented by kinetic models that are similar to the following hypothetical two-state scheme.

$$
C \underset{k_{c}}{k_{o}} \mathrm{O}
$$

This scheme indicates that a channel can reversibly change its conformation between closed (C) and open (O) states according to first-order reactions that are determined by an opening rate constant $\left(k_{o}\right)$ and a closing rate constant $\left(k_{k}\right)$. The probability of channel opening $\left(\boldsymbol{P}_{a}\right)$ is the fraction of total time that the channel is in the open state.

We already have seen in Figure 6-15 that the average of many single channel records from a given patch produces a time course that is similar to a macroscopic current recorded from the same cell. The same is true for the sum of the

Figure 6-16 Voltage dependence of currents through single $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels in outside-out patches. A, The channel is a $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor channel, which is a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel activated by GABA.

individual single channel current records. This conclusion leads to an important relationship: macroscopic ionic current is equal to the product of the number of channels $(\boldsymbol{N})$ within the membrane area, the unitary current of single channels, and the probability of channel opening:

$$
I=N P_{0} i
$$

Comparison of the magnitude of macroscopic currents recorded from large areas of voltage-clamped membrane with the magnitude of unitary current measured by patch techniques indicates that the surface density of ion channels typically falls into the range of 1 to 1000 channels per square micrometer of cell membrane, depending on the channel and cell type.

## MOLECULAR PHYSIOLOGY OF ION CHANNELS

## Classes of ion channels can be distinguished on the basis of electrophysiology, pharmacological and physiological ligands, intracellular messengers, and sequence homology

Mammalian cells express a remarkable array of ion channels. One way of making sense of this diversity is to classify channels according to their functional characteristics. Among these characteristics are electrophysiological behavior, inhibition or stimulation by various pharmacological agents, activation by extracellular agonists, and modulation by intracellular regulatory molecules. In addition, we can
classify channels by structural characteristics, such as aminoacid sequence homology and the kinds of subunits of which they are composed.

Electrophysiology The electrophysiological approach consists of analyzing ionic currents by voltage-clamp techniques and then characterizing channels on the basis of ionic selectivity, dependence of gating on membrane potential, and kinetics of opening and closing.

One of the most striking differences among channels is their selectivity for various ions. Indeed, channels are generally named according to which ion they are most permeable to-for example, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels.

Another major electrophysiological characteristic of channels is their voltage dependence. In electrically excitable cells (e.g., nerve, skeletal muscle, heart), a major class of channels becomes activated-and often inactivated-as a steep function of $V_{m}$. For example, the opening probability of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel in nerve and muscle cells increases steeply as $V_{m}$ becomes more positive (see Figs. 7-7B and 7-8B). Such voltage-gated channels are generally highly selective for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

Channels are also distinguished by the kinetics of gating behavior. For example, imagine two channels, each with an open probability $\left(P_{o}\right)$ of 0.5 . One channel might exhibit openings and closures with a duration of 10 ms each on average, whereas the other may have the same $P_{o}$ with openings and closures of 1 ms each on average. Complex gating patterns of some channels are characterized by bursts of many brief openings, followed by longer silent periods.

Pharmacological Ligands Currents that are virtually indistinguishable by electrophysiological criteria can sometimes be distinguished pharmacologically. For example, subtypes of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels can be distinguished by their sensitivity to the peptide toxin $\mu$-conotoxin, which is produced by Conus geographus, a member of a family of venomous marine mollusks called cone snails. This toxin strongly inhibits the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels of adult rat skeletal muscle but has little effect on the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels of neurons and cardiac myocytes. Another conotoxin ( $\omega$-conotoxin) from a different Conus species specifically inhibits voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the spinal cord. A synthetic version of this conotoxin (ziconotide) is available for treatment of neuropathic pain in patients.

Physiological Ligands Some channels are characterized by their unique ability to be activated by the binding of a particular molecule termed an agonist. For example, at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction, a channel called the nicotinic acetylcholine ( ACh ) receptor ( $\mathrm{N6}$-19 opens in response to the binding of ACh released from a presynaptic nerve terminal. This ACh receptor is an example of the pentameric Cys-loop superfamily of ligand-gated channels or agonist-gated channels (see p. 213). Other agonist-gated channels are activated directly by neurotransmitters such as glutamate, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine.

Intracellular Messengers Channels can be categorized by their physiological regulation by intracellular messengers. For example, increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ stimulate some ionic currents, in particular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$currents. Channels underlying such currents are known as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ gated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, respectively. Another example is seen in the plasma membrane of light-sensitive rod cells of the retina, in which a particular type of channel is directly activated by intracellular cGMP.

The four functional criteria for characterizing channelselectrophysiology, pharmacology, extracellular agonists, and intracellular regulators-are not mutually exclusive. For example, one of the major types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is also voltage gated.

Sequence Homology The diversity of channels implied by functional criteria ultimately requires a molecular biological approach to channel classification. Such an approach began in the 1970s and 1980s with the biochemical purification of channel proteins. Membrane biochemists originally used rich natural sources of ion channels, such as the electric organs of the Torpedo ray and Electrophorus eel, to isolate channel proteins such as the nicotinic ACh receptor (see pp. 210-212) and the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, respectively. Partial amino-acid sequencing of purified channel proteins provided the information needed to prepare oligonucleotide probes for isolating the complete coding sequences of the channel. Genes encoding many different types of ion channel proteins were initially identified in this way. Sequences of ion channel genes-now available directly from the human genome-show that channels are far more diverse than first suggested by physiological studies.

On the basis of amino-acid sequences of mammalian channel proteins, we now can identify 20 distinct families of channel proteins, which are further subclassified into a larger number of gene subfamilies (Table 6-2). Substantial progress in revealing the three-dimensional structures of channels comes from two sources: x-ray crystallographic analysis of three-dimensional protein crystals and cryoelectron microscopy of membrane preparations containing densely packed, two-dimensional crystalline arrays of proteins. Molecular information gleaned from sequence and structural analyses of channel proteins has revealed a number of important themes that we discuss in the remainder of this subchapter.

## Many channels are formed by a radially symmetric arrangement of subunits or domains around a central pore

The essential function of a channel is to facilitate the passive flow of ions across the hydrophobic membrane bilayer according to the electrochemical gradient. This task requires the channel protein to form an aqueous pore. The ionophore gramicidin is a small peptide that forms a unique helix dimer that spans the membrane; the hollow cylindrical region inside the helix is the channel pore. Another interesting type of channel structure is that of the porin channel proteins (see p. 109), which are present in the outer membranes of mitochondria and gram-negative bacteria. This protein forms a large pore through the center of a barrel-like structure; the 16 staves of the barrel are formed by 16 strands of the protein, each of which is in a $\beta$-sheet conformation. However, the structural motifs of a hole through a helix (gramicidin) or a hole through a 16 -stranded $\beta$ barrel (porin) appear to be exceptions rather than the rule.

For the majority of eukaryotic channels, the aqueous pores are located at the center of an oligomeric rosette-like arrangement of homologous subunits in the plane of the membrane (Fig. 6-17). Channels can have three, four, five, or six of these subunits, each of which is a polypeptide that weaves through the membrane several times. In some cases (e.g., voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels), the channel is not a true homo-oligomer or hetero-oligomer but rather a pseudo-oligomer in which a single polypeptide contains repetitive, homologous domains. In these channels, the rosette-like arrangement of repetitive domains-rather than distinct subunits-surrounds a central pore. (T) N6-20

## Gap junction channels are made up of two connexons, each of which has six identical subunits called connexins

Gap junctions are protein channels that connect two cells via a large, unselective pore-having a diameter of $\sim 1.4 \mathrm{~nm}$ at the narrowest constriction-that allows solutes as large as 1 kDa (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, glucose, cyclic nucleotides, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left[\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right]$, ADP, ATP) to pass between cells (Fig. 6-18A). These channels have been found in virtually all mammalian cells with only a few exceptions, such as adult skeletal muscle and erythrocytes. For example, gap junctions interconnect hepatocytes of the liver, cardiac muscle fibers of the heart and smooth muscle of the gut, $\beta$ cells of the pancreas, and epithelial cells in the cornea of the eye, to name just a few. Gap junctions provide pathways for chemical communication and electrical coupling between cells. The gap junction comprises two apposed hexameric

# N6-19 Structure of the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), which are all ligand-gated ion channels, come in two major subtypes, $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ nicotinic AChRs are at the neuromuscular junction, whereas the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ AChRs are found in the autonomic nervous system (on the postsynaptic membrane of the postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons) and in the central nervous system. Both $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ are ligand-gated ion channels activated by ACh or nicotine. However, whereas the $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ receptors at the neuromuscular junction are stimulated by decamethonium and preferentially blocked by $\delta$ 'tubocurarine and $\alpha$-bungarotoxin, the autonomic $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are stimulated by tetramethylammonium, blocked by hexamethonium, but resistant to $\alpha$-bungarotoxin. When activated, $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are both permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, with the entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$dominating. Thus, the nicotinic stimulation leads to rapid depolarization.

The nicotinic AChRs in skeletal muscle and autonomic ganglia are heteropentamers. That is, five nonidentical protein subunits surround a central pore, in a rosette fashion. (1) N6-20 Because the five subunits are not identical, the structure exhibits pseudosymmetry, rather than true symmetry. There are at least ten $\alpha$
subunits $\left(\alpha_{1}\right.$ to $\left.\alpha_{10}\right)$ and four $\beta$ subunits ( $\beta_{1}$ to $\left.\beta_{4}\right)$. As we will see below, the basis for these differences is a difference in subunit composition.

The $\mathbf{N}_{1}$ receptors have different subunit compositions depending upon location and developmental stage. The subunit composition of $\alpha_{1} \beta \gamma \delta$ is found in fetal skeletal muscle, as well as the nonjunctional regions of denervated adult skeletal muscle. The electric organ of the electric eel (Torpedo), from which the channel was first purified, has the same subunit composition. The subunit composition of $\alpha_{2} \beta \varepsilon \delta$ is found at the neuromuscular junction of adult skeletal muscle. Here, the $\varepsilon$ subunit replaces the $\gamma$ subunit. In both the $\alpha_{2} \beta \gamma \delta$ and $\alpha_{2} \beta \varepsilon \delta$ pentamers, the $\alpha$ subunits are of the $\alpha_{1}$ subtype and the $\beta$ subunits are of the $\beta_{1}$ subtype.

In the Torpedo $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ AChRs, the $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ subunits have polypeptide lengths of 437 to 501 amino acids. eFigure 6-1 shows side and top views of this AChR.

The $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ receptors in the nervous system, like those in muscle, are heteromers, probably heteropentamers. $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors use $\alpha_{2}$ to $\alpha_{10}$ and $\beta_{2}$ to $\beta_{4}$.

## N6-20 Rosette Arrangement of Channel Subunits

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The radial arrangement of subunits or domains around a central pore appears to be a common theme of channel structure. Figure 6-17 in the text illustrates that various membrane protein channels can be classified according to whether they are formed from three, four, five, or six separate subunits or from a number of subunit-like domains within a single polypeptide. An example of a channel composed of nonidentical subunits is the nicotinic ACh receptor channel. An example of a channel composed of identical subunits is the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Thus, such $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels have a homotetrameric, symmetric subunit arrangement, whereas the gap junction has a homohexameric structure.

Finally, the voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are examples of channels formed by four internally homologous, nonidentical subunit-like domains within a single large $\sim 250-\mathrm{kDa}$ polypeptide $\alpha$ subunit. These latter channels are formed by a pseudosymmetrical arrangement of four homologous domains, rather than distinct subunits. We discuss the voltage-sensitive cation channels in more detail beginning on page 182. Thus, the major families of channel proteins found in membranes have apparently solved the problem of how to get an ion across a membrane by forming a channel at the central interface of protein subunits or domains.

![bo1614543376c](bo1614543376c.jpg)

Figure 6-17 Structure of ion channels. Most ion channels consist of three to six subunits that are arranged like a rosette in the plane of the membrane. The channel can be made up of (1) identical, distinct subunits (homo-oligomer); (2) distinct subunits that are homologous but not identical (hetero-oligomer); or (3) repetitive subunit-like domains within a single polypeptide (pseudo-oligomer). In any case, these subunits surround the central pore of the ion channel. Note that each subunit is itself made up of several transmembrane segments.
structures called connexons, one contributed by each cell. Two connexons contact each other to form an end-to-end protein channel with a total length of 15.5 nm , bridging a gap of $\sim 4 \mathrm{~nm}$ between the two cell membranes. Each connexon has six identical subunits-connexins (Cx)-that surround a central pore in so-called radial hexameric symmetry (see Fig. 6-18B). Each Cx is an integral membrane protein with four transmembrane helices (TM1 to TM4) and a molecular mass ranging from 26 to 62 kDa for different connexin subtypes.

A given connexon hexamer in a particular cell membrane may be formed from a single connexin (homomeric) or a mixture of different connexin proteins (heteromeric). The apposition of two identical connexon hexamers forms a homotypic channel; the apposition of dissimilar connexon hexamers forms a heterotypic channel. Such structural variation in the assembly of connexons provides for greater diversity of function and regulation.

The gating properties of gap junctions can be studied by measuring electrical currents through gap junctions using two patch electrodes simultaneously placed in a pair of coupled cells (see Fig. 6-18C). When the two cells are clamped at different values of $V_{m}$, so that current flows from one cell to the other via the gap junctions, the current measured in either cell fluctuates as a result of the opening and closing of individual gap junction channels. Because the amount of current that enters one cell is the same as the amount of current that leaves the other cell, the current fluctuations in the two cells are mirror images of one another. Studies of this
type show that increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ or decreases in intracellular pH generally favor the closing of gap junction channels. Phosphorylation can also regulate gap junction channels.

The gating of many gap junction channels responds to the difference in transjunctional voltage $\left(V_{i}\right)$ of the two coupled cells, a process known as transjunctional voltage gating. Gap junction channels formed by Cx26 connexin close when the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ on the cytoplasmic side is positive (see Fig. 6-18D).

Human Cx26 connexin is present in many organs such as the liver, brain, skin, and inner ear. Point mutations throughout the sequence of human Cx26 are the major cause of nonsyndromic sensorineural deafness, the genetic basis for more than half of all cases of congenital deafness (Box 6-1).

## An evolutionary tree called a dendrogram illustrates the relatedness of ion channels

Comparisons of amino-acid sequences of channels and of the nucleotide sequences of genes that encode them provide insight into the molecular evolution of these proteins. The current human genome database contains at least 263 different genes encoding channel proteins. Like other proteins, specific isoforms of channels are differentially expressed in different parts of cells in various tissues and at certain stages of development. In particular, many different kinds of channels are expressed in the brain. In the central nervous system, the great diversity of ion channels provides a means of specifically and precisely regulating the complex electrical

activity of 100 billion brain neurons that are connected in numerous functional pathways.
As an example of the diversity and species interrelatedness of a channel family, consider the connexins. Figure 6-19A compares 14 sequences of homologous proteins that are members of the connexin family. Like many other proteins, connexins are encoded by a family of related genes that evolved by gene duplication and divergence. In the connexin family, various subtypes are named according to their protein molecular masses. Thus, rat Cx32 refers to a rat connexin with a protein molecular mass of $\sim 32 \mathrm{kDa}$. The various

## BOX 6-1 Genetic Defects in Connexin Genes

Many human genetic diseases have been identified in which the primary defect has been mapped to mutations of ion channel proteins. For example, mutations in the 21 connexin genes in the human genome cause diverse hereditary diseases resulting in craniofacial and bone deformities (Cx43), deafness (Cx26, Cx30, Cx31), myelin-related disease (Cx32), skin disorders (Cx26, Cx30), and congenital cataracts (Cx46, Cx50). Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a rare form of hereditary neuropathy that involves the progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves. Patients with this inherited disease have been found to have various mutations in the human gene GJB1, which encodes Cx32 M6-24 and is located on the $X$ chromosome. Cx32 appears to be involved in forming gap junctions between the folds of Schwann cell membranes. These Schwann cells wrap around the axons of peripheral nerves and form a layer of insulating material called myelin, which is critical for the conduction of nerve impulses. Mutations in Cx32 appear to hinder diffusion across the concentric layers of myelin, which results in disruption of myelin and hence axonal degeneration. Mutations in Cx26, Cx30, Cx30.3, and Cx31 all cause sensorineural deafness, which may result from poor secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the endolymph (see Fig. 15-21). Mutations in Cx46 and Cx56expressed in lens cells of the eye-cause a variety of congenital cataract disorders. (1) N6-25 Many other human diseases-call channelopathies-involve either a genetic defect of a particular channel protein or an autoimmune response directed against a channel protein (see Table 6-2).
connexins differ primarily in the length of the intracellular C-terminal domain.

By aligning connexin sequences according to identical amino acids and computing the relative similarity of each pair of connexin sequences, it is possible to reconstruct a hypothetical phylogenetic tree of evolutionary relationships. Such a tree is called a dendrogram. The one in Figure 6-19A includes nine rat, two human, one chicken, and two frog (Xenopus) connexins. The horizontal branch lengths of the tree are approximately proportional to the sequence differences or evolutionary divergence between protein members of the family. Closely grouped clusters of sequences in the tree represent evolutionarily related groups of proteins. The connexin tree indicates that the Cx32 genes from rats and humans are very closely related, differing by only 4 amino acids of a total of 284 residues. Thus, these Cx32 proteins probably represent the same functional genes in these two species-orthologous genes. The closely related Cx43 genes from the rat and human are also likely to be orthologs.

A sequence analysis restricted to only human connexin genes reveals five families-GJA through GJE-that cluster in the dendrogram in Figure 6-19B. Related channel proteins often exhibit different patterns of tissue expression. For example, Cx32 is expressed in the liver, Schwann cells, and oligodendrocytes, whereas Cx43 is expressed in heart and many other tissues.

The functional properties of channels are generally consistent with the classification of channel subtypes based on molecular evolution. For example, ion channels that are voltage gated (see p. 189) share sequence homology of their voltage-sensing domain.

## Hydrophobic domains of channel proteins can predict how these proteins weave through the membrane

From sequence information and atomic-resolution structures of many ion channels, a number of common structural principles emerge. Like other integral membrane proteins (see pp. 16-19), channel proteins generally have several segments of hydrophobic amino acids, each long enough ( $\sim 20$ amino acids) to span the lipid bilayer as an $\alpha$ helix.

Figure 6-18 Gap junction channels. A, Connexins, connexons, and gap junction channels in apposing membranes. B, Crystal structure of human Cx26, showing two connexons consisting of six connexins (shown in six colors), each made up of four transmembrane segments. The aqueous pore-lined primarily by the TM1 transmembrane helix-has an inner diameter ranging from 4.0 nm at the wide funnel-like cytoplasmic entrance to 1.4 nm near the middle of the membrane. C, The left panel shows the preparation of the two cells, each of which is voltage clamped by means of a patch pipette in the whole-cell configuration (see Fig. 6-14). Because cell 1 is clamped to -40 mV and cell 2 is clamped to -80 mV , current flows through the gap junctions from cell 1 to cell 2 . The right panel shows that the current recorded by the electrode in cell 1 is the mirror image of the current recorded in cell 2. The fluctuating current transitions represent the openings and closings of individual gap junction channels. D, The short N-terminal helix (NTH, shown in red) of each of the six connexins forms a circular girdle that lines the funnel of the cytoplasmic opening of the channel. The NTH contains an aspartate residue (D) as well as a tryptophan residue (W) that interacts with a methionine (M) on a transmembrane segment. The left side of the panel shows an open configuration of the gap junction channel when the transjunctional potential ( $V_{j}$ ) is zero, that is, when the upper and lower cells are at the same potential. When the upper cell is more positive than the lower $\left(V_{j}>0\right)$, the six NTHs in the upper connexion move inward and assemble into a plug that blocks the pore. When the lower cell is more positive than the upper ( $V_{j}<0$ ), the six NTHs in the lower connexion move inward and assemble into a plug.

If the channel has $N$ membrane-spanning segments, it also has $N+1$ hydrophilic domains of variable length that connect or terminate the membrane spans. Many putative transmembrane segments predicted by hydropathy analysis (see Table 2-1) have proven to be transmembrane segments in an $\alpha$-helical conformation. The intervening hydrophilic segments that link the transmembrane regions together typically fold to form extracellular and intracellular protein domains that contact the aqueous solution.

The primary sequences of channel proteins are often schematically represented by hypothetical folding diagrams, such as those shown in Figure 6-20. For example, connexin monomers have four identifiable hydrophobic transmembrane segments, known as M1, M2, M3, and M4 (see Fig. 6-20A).

The crystal structure of Cx 26 indicates that the N -terminal and C-terminal hydrophilic segments of connexin are located on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane. The N terminus is involved in voltage gating of the channel, and TM1 is the major pore-lining helix (see Fig. 6-18B). Mutations in Cx32 and many other connexin genes result in a wide variety of physiological abnormalities (see Box 6-1).

## Protein superfamilies, subfamilies, and subtypes are the structural bases of channel diversity

Table 6-2 summarizes the basic functional and structural aspects of currently recognized families of the pore-forming subunits of human ion channel proteins. The table (1) groups these channels into structurally related protein families; (2) describes their properties; (3) lists the assigned human gene symbols, number of genes, and protein names; (4) summarizes noted physiological functions; (5) lists human diseases associated with the corresponding ion channels; and (6) provides a reference to Figure 6-20 that indicates the hypothetical membrane topology. Because some of the mem-brane-topology diagrams in Figure 6-20 are based primarily on hydropathy analysis, they should be considered "bestguess" representations unless the three-dimensional structure has been established by structural biology. Here, we briefly summarize major aspects of the molecular physiology of human ion channel families, in the order of their presentation in Table 6-2. (T) N6-22

Connexins We discussed these channels above in the section on gap junctions, in Figures 6-18, 6-19, and 6-20A, as well as in Box 6-1.

K+ Channels The tetrameric $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels form the largest and most diverse family of ion channels. They are part of the voltage-gated-like (VGL) superfamily of channels, which includes all channels in Figure 6-20B through $M$. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selective pore of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is formed by a highly conserved domain containing two transmembrane segments linked by a pore loop labeled $P$ in the figure. The family includes five distinct subfamilies, all of which we will discuss beginning on p. 189: (1) Kv voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see pp. 193-196), (2) $\mathbf{S K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ small- and $\mathbf{I K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ intermediate-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see pp. 193-196), (3) $\mathbf{B K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ large-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ - and voltage-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see p. 196), (4) Kir inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see p. 196), and (5) K2P dimeric tandem two-pore $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see p. 199). For the first two subfamilies, each of the four subunits contains six TMs denoted S1 to S6 (see Fig. 6-20B, C). $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are similar to Kv channels but have an additional S0 TM (see Fig. 6-20D). Kir channels are structurally the simplest members of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel family because each of the four subunits contains two TMs analogous to S5 and S6 in the Kv channels (see Fig. 6-20E). K2P channels are the equivalent of a tandem duplication of Kir channels so that two K2P subunits form a pseudotetrameric channel (see Fig. 6-20F).

HCN, CNG, and TRP Channels HCN hyperpolarizationactivated, cyclic nucleotide-gated cation channels (see Fig. 6-20G) play a critical role in electrical automaticity of the

# N6-22 Voltage-Gated Channels 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Some families of channel proteins are so large and diverse that they are known as superfamilies. For example, the superfamily of voltage-gated channels consists of $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, respectively denoted $\mathrm{Kv}, \mathrm{Nav}$, and Cav. These channels have a common structural motif (see pp. 182-199). These channels play a primary role in electrical signaling in the nervous system, where they underlie the voltage-dependent depolarization (Nav, Cav) and hyperpolarization (Kv) of propagating action potentials (discussed in Chapter 7). The pore-forming complex of each of these channels consists of four subunits or domains, each of which contains six transmembrane segments denoted as S 1 through S6. Voltage-gated $\mathbf{K}^{+}$channels are believed to represent an evolutionary precursor to Nav and Cav channels because their pore-forming subunit contains only one S 1 through S6 domain (see Fig. 6-20B). Voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are homotetramers or heterotetramers of monomer subunits. The poreforming subunits of $\mathbf{N a}^{+}$and $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$ channels (see Fig. 6-20K, L) both comprise four domains (I, II, III, and IV), each of which contains the S 1 through S 6 structural motif that is homologous to the basic voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel subunit or monomer. Because domains I through IV of Nav and Cav channels are organized as four tandem repeats within the membrane, these domains are referred to as pseudosubunits. The molecular evolution of the four-repeat structure of Nav and Cav channels is believed to have occurred by a process involving consecutive
gene duplication from a primordial gene containing S1 through S6. Members of the voltage-gated superfamily of channels are also recognized by a characteristic structure of the S4 transmembrane segment in which four to seven positively charged residues (lysine or arginine) are located at every third position. This unique S4 domain appears to function as the voltage-sensing element of voltage-gated ion channels (see p. 184).

Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels also illustrate another feature of some ion channels: they are multisubunit complexes consisting of accessory proteins in addition to the channel-forming subunits. For example, Cav channels are composed of a large pseudotetrameric $\alpha_{1}$ subunit with domains I through IV that form the pore, plus four additional structurally unrelated subunits known as $\alpha_{2}$, $\beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ (see Fig. 6-20L). Like the homologous $\alpha$ subunit of Nav channels, the large $\alpha_{1}$ subunit of Cav channels specifies most of the basic channel functions, including ionic selectivity, voltage sensitivity, and the binding sites of various drugs. It appears that the $\beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ subunits are important for modulating the activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, but their exact functional roles are largely unknown. In some cases, accessory subunits modulate the gating activity and pharmacology of channel complexes, whereas in other cases such accessory subunits of channels may help target newly synthesized channels to their proper cellular locations.

heart (see p. 488) and rhythmically firing neurons of the brain. CNG channels form a family of cation-selective channels that are directly activated by intracellular cGMP or cAMP. These channels play an important role in visual (see p. 368) and olfactory sensory transduction (see p. 359). The CNGs have the same basic S 1 through S 6 motif as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, but they contain a unique cyclic nucleotide-binding domain at the C terminus (see Fig. 6-20H). TRP transient receptor potential cation channels (see Fig. 6-20I) function in diverse sensory processes and include six subfamilies: TRPA (for $\mu$ nkyrin like), TRPC (for çanonical), TRPM (for $\alpha$ telastatin), MCOLN or TRPML (for $\mu$ picolipin), PKD or TRPP (for polycystin 2), and TRPV (for $\gamma$ anilloid). TRPV1 is activated by capsaicin, the "hot" ingredient of chili peppers, whereas TRPM8 responds to menthol, the "cool"-tasting substance in eucalyptus leaves. The capsaicin receptor TRPV1 functions in pain and temperature sensation.

NAADP Receptor NAADP (nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate) is an intracellular signaling molecule. Two TPCN genes in the human genome encode a protein with two tandem repeats of an S1 to S6 motif (see Fig. 6-20J). These proteins function in NAADP-activated release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum and acidic compartments.

Voltage-Gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels The 10 pore-forming subunits of Nav voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels comprise four domains (I, II, III, and IV), each of which contains the S1 to S6 structural motif (see Fig. 6-20K) that is homologous to $\mathrm{Kv} \mathrm{K}^{+}$channel monomers. Because domains I to IV of Nav channels are organized as four tandem repeats within the membrane, these domains are referred to as pseudosubunits. The Nav channels are associated with a unique family of auxiliary $\beta$ subunits that are known to modify the gating behavior and membrane localization of the channel-forming $\alpha$ subunit.

Voltage-Gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Channels The pore-forming subunits of Cav voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 190-191) are analogous to those for the Nav channels (see Fig. 6-20L). Like Nav channels, Cav channels are multisubunit complexes consisting of accessory proteins in addition to the channelforming subunits.

CatSper Channels The unique class of CatSper tetrameric channels-with an S1 to S6 motif (see Fig. 6-20M)-is expressed in the sperm tail membrane. These channels mediate a voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current that is essential for male fertility (see Fig. 56-1).

Hv Channels The unusual Hv channel protein consists of an S1 to S4 voltage-sensing motif but lacks a conventional S5-P-S6 pore domain (see Fig. 6-20N). The Hv protein functions as an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$channel that opens only when the cell is sufficiently depolarized to mediate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$efflux. Hv, as a functional component of the NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) oxidase complex, is important in the innate immune response of neutrophils; Hv is also involved in sperm activation.

Ligand-Gated Channels The agonist-activated channels are also represented by three large and diverse gene families. The pentameric Cys-loop receptor family (see Fig. 6-20O) includes cation- or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-selective ion channels that are activated by binding of ACh (see pp. 212-213), serotonin, GABA, and glycine (see pp. 326-327). Glutamate-activated cation channels (see Fig. 6-20P) include two subfamilies of excitatory AMPA ( $\alpha$-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid)-kainate and NMDA ( $N$-methyl-D-aspartate) receptors (see pp. 323-324). Purinergic ligand-gated cation channels (see Fig. 6-20Q) are activated by binding of extracellular ATP and other nucleotides (see p. 327).

Other Ion Channels ENaC amiloride-sensitive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are prominent in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-transporting epithelia (see Fig. 6-20R and pp. 758-759). The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (see Fig. 6-20S and p. 120) that is a member of the ABC (ATP-binding cassette) protein family. The unrelated ClC family of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels are dimeric (see Fig. 6-20T). (5) N6-23 Two unique genes coding for the anoctamim family of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ - and voltageactivated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels have been added to the channel gene collection (see Fig. 6-20U). Table 6-2 includes two types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channels. ITPR (see p. 60) is present in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and is gated by the intracellular messenger $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ (see Fig. 6-20V). RYR (see p. 230) is located in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane of muscle and plays a critical role in the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during muscle contraction (see Fig. 6-20W). A recently discovered family of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-selective-channel proteins known as Orai storeoperated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see Fig. 6-20X) plays a role in entry of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the plasma membrane linked to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ metabolism and depletion of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the endoplasmic reticulum of nonexcitable cells, such as lymphocytes (see p. 247).

# ELECTRICAL EXCITABILITY AND ACTION POTENTIALS 

Edward G. Moczydlowski

Cellular communication in the nervous system is based on electrical and chemical signaling events that are mediated by ion channels. Certain types of cells, including neurons and myocytes, have a remarkable property called electrical excitability. In cells with this property, depolarization of the membrane above a certain threshold voltage triggers a spontaneous all-or-none response called an action potential. This action potential is a transient, regenerative electrical impulse in which the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ rapidly rises to a peak that is $\sim 100 \mathrm{mV}$ more positive than the normal, negative resting voltage $\left(V_{\text {rest }}\right)$. Such signals, also called spikes, can propagate for long distances along nerve or muscle fibers. Conduction of action potentials allows information from sensory organs to be transmitted along afferent nerves leading to the brain. Conversely, the brain exerts voluntary and involuntary control over muscles and other effector organs by efferent nerves leading away from it.

In the first part of this chapter, we examine the biophysical and molecular basis of action potentials and the mechanisms that underlie their genesis and propagation. The second part deals with the structure and function of voltagegated ion channel proteins. Finally, we examine the conduction properties of neurons-called cable properties-and how they determine the spread of action potentials along the axon.

## MECHANISMS OF NERVE AND MUSCLE ACTION POTENTIALS

## An action potential is a transient depolarization triggered by a depolarization beyond a threshold

The change in membrane potential that occurs during an action potential can be accurately measured by recording $V_{m}$ with an intracellular microelectrode. Figure $7-1 A$ is a diagram illustrating various features of a typical action potential recorded from a nerve or muscle cell stimulated with an electrode. Alternatively, for cells that are not easily accessible, such as brain neurons, one can induce expression of light-activated ion channels, such as channelrhodopsins from unicellular algae, and use light to change $V_{m}$ experimentally. 0 N7-1 If the depolarizing stimulus causes $V_{m}$ to become more positive than a threshold voltage, the depolarization triggers an action potential. The initial
depolarizing (positive-going) phase of an action potential consists of a rapid and smooth increase in $V_{m}$ from the negative resting potential to a maximum positive value that typically lies between +10 and +40 mV . This sharp rise in $V_{m}$ to the peak voltage of the action potential is then followed by a slower repolarizing (negative-going) phase. The part of the action potential that lies above 0 mV is called the overshoot. As we will see, the time course and shape of the repolarization phase vary considerably among different excitable tissues and cells. The repolarization phase may lead directly back to $V_{\text {rest }}$, or it may undershoot and give rise to a voltage minimum that is more negative than $V_{\text {rest }}$ before relaxing back to $V_{\text {rest }}$. Such an undershoot is an example of an afterhyperpolarization.

The threshold, amplitude, time course, and duration of the action potential depend on the following factors:

1. The gating (opening and closing) and permeability properties of specific types of ion channels-these properties depend on both $V_{m}$ and time.
2. The intracellular and extracellular concentrations of the ions that pass through these channels, such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.
3. Membrane properties such as capacitance, resistance, and the geometry of the cell.

The shape of the action potential in a given cell reflects the specialized functions of that cell. For example, the brief action potentials of a nerve axon permit rapid signaling, whereas the prolonged, repetitive action potentials of cardiac and certain types of smooth-muscle cells mediate the slower, rhythmic contractions of these tissues. Figure 7-1B compares action potentials recorded from an invertebrate nerve fiber (unmyelinated squid axon), a vertebrate nerve fiber (myelinated rabbit axon), a skeletal muscle fiber, and a cardiac atrial myocyte. This comparison illustrates the diversity in the duration and shape of the repolarizing phase of action potentials. The shape of the action potential is subject to hormonal modulation in certain cell types. As one example, the peptide hormone endothelin, produced by vascular endothelial cells, shortens the duration of the action potential when it is applied to a guinea pig atrial myocyte. Modulation of the shape and frequency of action potentials occurs by various biochemical regulatory mechanisms that affect the function of ion channels.

# N7-1 Controlling Membrane Potential with Channelrhodopsins 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

An exciting new optical technique involves the use of membrane proteins called channelrhodopsins (ChRs) discovered in singlecelled algae such as Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. ChR is homologous to the rhodopsin protein of mammalian photoreceptor cells except that it functions as a light-activated ion channel. Expression of engineered ChR in mammalian neurons allows the $V_{m}$ of the transfected neurons to be changed by simple illumination with light of an appropriate wavelength absorbed by the ChR. Thus, ChR and related light-gated channels can be used as optical switches to turn on or off the electrical activity of specific cells in various tissues such as the brain. This method has initiated a new field called optogenetics which enables the function of individual cells in the nervous system to be studied by observing the physiological response to light activation in living transgenic
animals. Someday it may be possible to control arrhythmia in a diseased heart with light or to restore visual perception to a defective retina with the use of such approaches.

Figure 7-1 The action potential.

## In contrast to an action potential, a graded response is proportional to stimulus intensity and decays with distance along the axon

Not all electrical activity in nerve or muscle cells is characterized by an all-or-none response. When we apply a small square pulse of hyperpolarizing current to a cell membrane, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ gradually becomes more negative and then stabilizes (Fig. 7-2A). In such an experiment, the observed change in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ approximates an exponential time course, with a time constant (see p. 151) that is determined by the product of membrane resistance and capacitance $(\tau=R C)$. Figure 7-2A also shows that progressively greater hyperpolarizing currents produce progressively larger $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ responses, but the time constant is always the same. The size of the graded voltage change (i.e., the steady-state $\Delta V_{\mathrm{m}}$ ) is proportional to the strength of the stimulus (i.e., the current), in accord with Ohm's law.

If instead of imposing a hyperpolarizing stimulus we impose a small depolarizing stimulus, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ changes to the same extent and with the same time course as we described for the hyperpolarizing stimulus, but in the opposite direction (see Fig. 7-2A). The size of $\Delta V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is also proportional to the size of the depolarizing stimulus-up to a point. If the membrane is excitable, a square-wave depolarization above the threshold triggers an action potential, or voltage spike. Smaller or subthreshold depolarizations do not elicit an action potential. Hyperpolarizations are always ineffective. Thus, both hyperpolarizations and subthreshold depolarizations behave like graded voltage changes. That is, the magnitude of a cell's voltage change increases proportionally with the size of the stimulus. Such graded responses can be seen in the response of certain cells to synaptic transmitters, to sensory stimuli (e.g., light), or, in the laboratory, to the injection of current into cells through a microelectrode.

Why do excitable cells exhibit threshold behavior? As $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes progressively more and more positive, the gating process (i.e., transitions from closed to open states) of certain types of voltage-gated ion channels becomes activated. When $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ passes the threshold, opening of these voltage-gated channels initiates the runaway depolarization that characterizes the rising phase of the action potential. Thus, the firing of an action potential is a binary, all-or-none event; that is, the spike has a constant, nongraded voltage peak that occurs only if the depolarizing stimulus exceeds the threshold.

Thus far we have seen that graded responses and action potentials differ markedly from one another if we examine the cell at one particular site. However, graded responses and action potentials also behave very differently in the way that they spread along the membrane from the site of origin. Figure 7-2B illustrates how a graded hyperpolarizing response spreads along the axon of a neuron or along a skeletal muscle fiber. As the graded response spreads, its magnitude decays exponentially with the distance from the site of

The lower panels show four graded depolarizing stimuli and the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ responses. Note that the two largest stimuli evoke identical action potentials. B, A stimulating electrode injects current at the extreme left of the cell. Four recording electrodes monitor $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ at equidistant sites to the right. If the stimulus is hyperpolarizing, the graded $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ responses decay with distance from the stimulus site. If the stimulus is depolarizing and large enough to evoke an action potential, a full action potential appears at each of the recording sites. However, the action potential arrives at the more distant sites with increasing delay.

stimulation because of passive loss of electrical current to the medium. This decay is called electrotonic conduction. We see the same kind of electrotonic spread for a subthreshold, depolarizing stimulus. The electrotonic spread of graded responses is governed by the same physical principles that determine the spread of electrical current in an electrical cable. We briefly discuss cable theory at the end of this chapter.

Active propagation of an action potential signal is very different from the passive spread of a graded signal. In a healthy axon or muscle fiber, action potentials propagate at a constant velocity (up to $\sim 130 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ ), without change in amplitude or shape. The amplitude of a propagating action potential does not diminish with distance, as would a graded, subthreshold response, because excitation of voltage-gated channels in adjacent regions of the excitable membrane progressively regenerates the original response. Because the action potential in a given nerve fiber propagates at a constant velocity, the time delay between the stimulus and the peak of the action potential increases linearly with distance from the point of the stimulus.

## Excitation of a nerve or muscle depends on the product (strength $\times$ duration) of the stimulus and on the refractory period

In the preceding section, the importance of the magnitude (intensity) of the depolarizing stimulus emerged as a critical factor for firing of an action potential. However, the duration of the stimulus pulse is also important. A large stimulus is effective in triggering an action potential even at short duration, and a small stimulus may be effective at long duration (Fig. 7-3A). This strength-duration relationship arises because the same minimum electrical charge necessary to excite an action potential can come from a current that is either brief but large or prolonged but small. It is the product of strength and duration that determines excitability, and thus these two parameters are inversely related in their
effectiveness. However, regardless of the stimulus strength, successful stimulation requires a minimum duration (vertical asymptote in Fig. 7-3A). Conversely, regardless of the stimulus duration, successful stimulation requires a minimum strength (horizontal asymptote in Fig. 7-3A). (○) N7-2

An important feature of excitable cells is their ability to fire repetitive action potentials. Once a cell fires an action potential, how quickly can it fire a second? Suppose we inject a small step of current to produce a graded voltage response and then add a second current step while maintaining the first step. As long as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ does not exceed the threshold, the resulting voltage response would be a simple algebraic and instantaneous summation of the two graded responses. The situation for action potentials is quite different. First, action potentials never summate. Second, after one action potential fires, a finite time must elapse before it is possible to trigger a second. The interval after initiation of an action potential when it is impossible or more difficult to produce a second spike is the refractory period (see Fig. 7-3B). The refractory period consists of two distinct phases. The initial phase-the absolute refractory period-lasts from initiation of the spike to a time after the peak when repolarization is almost complete. Throughout this first phase, a second action potential cannot be elicited, regardless of the stimulus strength or duration. During the second phase-the relative refractory period-the minimal stimulus necessary for activation is stronger or longer than predicted by the strength-duration curve for the first action potential. The two phases of the refractory period arise from the gating properties of particular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and the overlapping time course of their currents. The refractory periods determine the upper limit of firing frequency.

## The action potential arises from changes in membrane conductance to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$

# N7-2 Rheobase and Chronaxie 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 7-3A in the text shows a strength-duration curve for nerve or muscle. As the duration of a stimulus increases, the minimum intensity of stimulation required to elicit an action potential decreases. The rheobase is the minimum intensity of stimulation required to generate an action potential when the stimulation is of infinite duration (i.e., the horizontal dashed line in Fig. 7-3A). Stimuli with an intensity greater than the rheobase require shorter times. When the stimulus intensity is twice the rheobase, the minimum duration required to achieve an action potential is the chronaxie.

electrochemical basis of the nerve action potential was finally elucidated by the combined application of modern electrical recording techniques and the theory of electrodiffusion (see pp. 146-147). We now understand that the nerve action potential is a phenomenon involving voltage-dependent currents of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that flow through distinct molecular pathways called $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. In 1963, Alan L. Hodgkin and Andrew F. Huxley shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine (5) N7-3 for their quantitative description of these ionic currents in the squid giant axon in studies involving two-electrode voltage-clamp recordings. (5) N7-4 Invertebrate axons are unmyelinated, and axons in certain squid nerves have an unusually large diameter ( 500 to $1000 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), which allows both external and internal ionic concentrations to be manipulated experimentally. The basic concepts underlying the Hodgkin-Huxley analysis have since been extended to a wide variety of voltage-dependent ionic currents.

The squid axon generates a very brief action potential signal without a significant plateau phase (Fig. 7-4). Ionic permeability changes underlying this impulse can be interpreted with a form of the constant-field equation (see Equation 6-9) that includes only $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$:

$$
V_{\mathrm{rev}}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(\frac{P_{\mathrm{K}}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{P_{\mathrm{K}}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}\right)
$$

According to Equation 7-1, $V_{\text {rev }}$ would correspond to a resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of -60 mV for a $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability ratio $\left(P_{\mathrm{K}} / P_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ of $-14: 1$. The change in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to a value near +40 mV at the peak of the action potential must involve a transient and selective increase in the permeability to either $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ because the equilibrium potential of these cations lies in the positive voltage range (see Fig. 6-10). Experimentally, if $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is reduced by replacing it with a nonelectrolyte such as sucrose, the nerve action potential decreases in amplitude. Complementary experiments measuring radioactive tracer fluxes of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$also demonstrate that action potentials are accompanied by a small influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and an efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. These and related findings showed that the waveform of the
squid action potential is produced by separate permeability pathways for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

The time course of the action potential (see Fig. 7-4) can be dissected into an initial, transient increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance (and thus permeability), followed by a similar but delayed increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance. As one predicts from Equation 6-12, a transient increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance shifts $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ toward the positive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$equilibrium potential $\left(E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$. The subsequent increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance shifts $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ back toward the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$equilibrium potential $\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$, thereby restoring the original negative resting potential. Thus, the depolarizing and repolarizing phases of the action potential reflect a transient reversal of the ratio of $\mathrm{K}^{+} / \mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductances.

## The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents that flow during the action potential are time and voltage dependent

The assumption of independent, distinct channels for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$has been verified by ion substitution and pharmacological experiments. Figure 7-5 illustrates the use of inhibitors to dissect $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right.$ and $\left.I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ from the total membrane current $\left(I_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ in a typical excitable membrane preparation, such as a myelinated vertebrate nerve fiber bathed in a normal physiological solution. In a myelinated nerve, these currents flow through small segments of the bare axon that are not covered with myelin—nodes of Ranvier. The pharmacological dissection of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ currents allows us to determine how they depend on time and $V_{\mathrm{m}}$.

Time Dependence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Currents Stepwise hyperpolarization of the nerve membrane (from a "holding potential" of -80 to -140 mV ) by a voltage-clamp technique produces a transient capacitative current (see p. 151), but little or no ionic current (see Fig. 7-5A). However, a step depolarization of equivalent magnitude produces a capacitative transient current that is followed by a large, timedependent ionic current (see Fig. 7-5B). This ionic current first flows inward, reaches a maximum in the inward direction, and then reverses to the outward direction. The initial

## N7-4 Two-Electrode Voltage Clamping


#### Abstract

Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Historically, the technique of two-electrode voltage clamping was first used to analyze the ionic currents in a preparation known as the perfused squid giant axon. Certain nerve fibers of the squid are so large that their intracellular contents can be extruded and the hollow fiber can be perfused with physiological solutions of various ionic composition. Electrodes in the form of thin wires can be inserted into the axon to clamp the axon membrane potential along its length and measure the current. This technique was used by Alan L. Hodgkin and Andrew F. Huxley in 1952 to deduce the nature of ionic conductance changes that underlie the nerve action potential. For this work, Hodgkin and Huxley shared (with J.C. Eccles) the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963. N7-3 The Hodgkin-Huxley analysis is discussed further beginning on pages 176-177.

Another, more recent, application of the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique is called oocyte recording (see Fig.


6-13A). A large oocyte from the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, is simultaneously impaled with two micropipette electrodes that serve to clamp the voltage and record current. Native Xenopus oocytes have only small endogenous currents, but they can be induced to express new currents by preinjecting the cell with messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from an isolated gene that codes for an ion channel protein. The oocyte system can therefore be used to characterize the conductance behavior of a relatively pure population of ion channels that are expressed in the plasma membrane after protein translation of the injected mRNA by the oocyte. This approach has proven to be an invaluable assay system for isolating complementary DNA molecules coding for many different types of channels and electrogenic transporters (see Chapter 5). This approach also has become a standard technique used to study the molecular physiology and pharmacology of ion channels.

Figure 7-5 Dissection of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents by voltage-clamp analysis and pharmacological methods. A, In a typical voltage-clamp experiment, a sudden hyperpolarization from -80 to -140 mV results in a transient capacitative current but no ionic currents. B, In a voltage-clamp experiment, a sudden depolarization from -80 to -20 mV results in a transient capacitative current followed first by an inward ionic current and then by an outward ionic current. C, Blockade of the outward current by TEA leaves only the inward current, which is carried by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Conversely, a blockade of the inward current by TTX or STX leaves only the outward current, which is carried by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.
inward current corresponds to a movement of cations into the axon. After the reversal of $I_{\mathrm{m}}$, the outward current corresponds to an outward movement of cations. Ion substitution experiments-in which selected ions are removed from either the outside or the inside of the cell-have shown that the inward current corresponds to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current and the outward current corresponds to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current. Applying a particular organic cation, tetraethylammonium (TEA), to an axon prevents the outward $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ and reveals the isolated inward $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (see Fig. 7-5C, top $I_{\mathrm{m}}$ record). Conversely, adding either tetrodotoxin (TTX) or saxitoxin (STX)—which we discuss below-abolishes the inward $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and reveals the isolated outward $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ (see Fig. 7-5C, bottom $I_{\mathrm{m}}$ record). TEA, TTX, and STX are cationic molecules that act as specific ion channel blockers. Millimolar concentrations of TEA block the outer entrance of certain neuronal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, and nanomolar concentrations of TTX (or STX) block the outer entrance of neuronal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. Biophysical evidence suggests that these particular molecules act by binding in the outer vestibule of their respective channels, thus occluding the channel pore to permeant ions. Therefore, the terms
channel block and blocking agent are often used to describe their effect.

Voltage Dependence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Currents The ability to use specific inhibitors to resolve separate pathways for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents in excitable membranes makes it possible to characterize how these ionic currents depend on $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Figure 7-6A illustrates an idealized family of records of total membrane current $\left(I_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ recorded from a myelinated nerve axon. In each case, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ was initially clamped to -60 mV and then rapidly shifted to a more positive value. The five traces in Figure 7-6A show the current evoked by depolarizations to $-45,-30,0,+30$, and +60 mV . By repeating the same experiment in the presence of TEA or TTX, one can obtain the unique time course and voltage dependence of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$.

The time course of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ obtained in the presence of TEA to block $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is distinctly biphasic (see Fig. 7-6B). Immediately after a depolarizing voltage step to a $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of -30 mV , for example, the inward $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (downward going) reaches a "peak" value and then returns to zero. The initial

![bo1784543376c](bo1784543376c.jpg)

phase of this time course (before the peak) is called activation, and the later phase (after the peak) is called inactivation.

In contrast to the time course of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$, a depolarizing voltage step to a $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of +60 mV , for example, causes the outward $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ to activate with a clear delay that gives rise to a sigmoidal time course (see Fig. 7-6C). Moreover, $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ takes longer than $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ to reach its maximal value, which is then sustained. Thus, $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ does not show significant inactivation on the same rapid time scale as does $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$.

If we plot the peak $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents obtained at each of the clamped voltages in Figure 7-6B and C against the clamped voltages, we obtain the two $I-V$ relationships shown in Figure 7-6D. Because the currents in Figure 7-6B and C represent the activity of many individual ion channels, the plots in Figure 7-6D are macroscopic current-voltage relationships. The $I-V$ relationship for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is the more straightforward of the two. If we step $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ from -60 mV to increasingly more positive values, the peak $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ is outward and increases with voltage in a monotonic fashion, as expected from Ohm's law $(\Delta I=\Delta V / R)$. Because such nerve $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels pass current in the outward direction and activate with a time delay (see Fig. 7-6C) under physiological conditions, the term delayed-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current (or delayed outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel) has been coined to describe them. We discuss this delayed outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current and the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel responsible for it in more detail below.

The voltage dependence of the peak $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current is biphasic. Stepping $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ from -60 mV to more positive values at first causes $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ to become increasingly negative (i.e., inward) and then reach a peak. This portion of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} I-V$ relationship is sometimes referred to as the negative resistance region because the negative slope corresponds to an anomalous or negative resistance value according to Ohm's law $(\Delta I=$ $\Delta V / R$ ). At more positive values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, the peak $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ reverses direction and becomes more positive, with a nearly linear or ohmic dependence on voltage. (5) N7-5

## Macroscopic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents result from the opening and closing of many channels

The complex macroscopic $I-V$ relationships of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents (see Fig. 7-6D) reflect the single channel conductance and gating of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The pore of an open channel is expected to have a linear or ohmic $I-V$ relationship:

$$
i_{\mathrm{X}}=g_{\mathrm{X}}\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}-E_{\mathrm{X}}\right)
$$

Here, $i_{\mathrm{x}}$ is the single channel current and $g_{\mathrm{x}}$ is the single channel conductance. We already introduced a similar relationship as Equation 6-15. Figure 7-7A illustrates the predicted linear behavior of single channel currents as a function of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ for hypothetical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Assuming an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reversal potential $\left(E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ of +50 mV , the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current is zero at a $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of +50 mV . Similarly, with an $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ of -80 mV , the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current is zero at a $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ of -80 mV . Assuming a unitary conductance of 20 picosiemens (pS) for each channel, the two $I-V$ relationships have the same slope. Note that these idealized single channel $I-V$ plots for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$approximate the shape of the macroscopic peak $I-V$ relationships of

Figure 7-7 Microscopic basis of macroscopic $I-V$ relationships. A, The blue line represents the $I-V$ relationship of an idealized open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. The green line represents the $I-V$ relationship of an idealized open $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel. Because the channels are assumed always to be fully open (i.e., the conductance does not change with voltage), the current through them is linear or ohmic. B, The blue curve shows the open probability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. The equation in the inset will generate this curve if the values $z_{\mathrm{Na}}=6.5$ and $V_{\mathrm{KX}}=-50 \mathrm{mV}$ are inserted. The green curve shows the open probability of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The equation in the inset will generate this curve if the values $z_{\mathrm{K}}=5.3$ and $V_{\mathrm{KX}}=-30 \mathrm{mV}$ are inserted. (5) N7-6 C, We can obtain a reasonable estimate for the macroscopic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current and the macroscopic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current by multiplying the single channel current in $\mathbf{A}$, the $P_{\mathrm{s}}$ in $\mathbf{B}$, and the number of channels ( $N$ ). We assume that there are $100 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $100 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$channels.

Figure 7-6D for the positive $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ range (i.e., in the right upper quadrant of Fig. 7-6D). In this $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ range, both the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels through which the currents flow are maximally activated at the peaks of their respective time courses. Thus, the macroscopic peak $I-V$ relationships (see Fig. 7-6D) are nearly linear in this range, just as they would be for idealized, fully open channels (see Fig. 7-7A).

# N7-5 Ohmic I-V Curve 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

According to Ohm's law ( $I=V / R$, the $I-V$ relationship is a straight line if $1 / R$ (i.e., the conductance) is constant. The slope is positive. For a simple electrical circuit consisting of a resistor and a voltage source, the line passes through the origin (i.e., $I=0$ when $V=0$ ). However, if the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current $\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ were ohmic (i.e., we assume that the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is the same on both sides of the membrane), $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is zero when the driving force ( $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ $-E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ ) is zero (see Equation 7-2 on p. 180 of the text). Therefore, the $I-V$ plot for an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current passes through the $x$-axis at the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$.

In real-life situations, the $I-V$ curve for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents is much more complicated, following the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz current equation, as discussed in (1) N6-8.

However, in the negative voltage range, the macroscopic peak $I-V$ relationships for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in Figure 7-6D deviate from the linear (or ohmic) behavior in Figure 7-7A. Why, as the voltage is made more negative, does the inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current fail to increase further and even decrease (negative resistance)? Similarly, why, as the voltage becomes more negative, does the outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current fall to zero long before the voltage reaches an $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ of -80 mV ? The answer is that the probability that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are "open" $\left(P_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ and therefore able to conduct current-depends on voltage. We introduced the concept of open probability on page 156. To see why $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ might affect $P_{\mathrm{o}}$, we consider a simplified model.

Assume that a channel protein molecule may exist in either of two conformational states, closed (C) and open (O), and that these two conformational states are in equilibrium with one another:

$$
\mathrm{C} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{O}
$$

The equilibrium constant $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ for this reaction is the ratio of the concentrations of open to closed channels, which can also be expressed as the ratio of the probability that the channel is open $\left(P_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ to the probability that the channel is closed $\left(P_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ :

$$
K_{\mathrm{eq}}=\frac{[\text { Open }]}{[\text { Closed }]}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{o}}}{P_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

In the case of voltage-gated channel proteins, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ changes affect $K_{\mathrm{eq}}$ and thus the distribution of channels between the open and closed states. $\leftrightarrows$ NO-6 The probability of a channel's being open depends on $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ according to a Boltzmann distribution (see Fig. 7-7B). Accordingly, if the valence (z) of the voltage-sensing part of the channel protein (i.e., the "gating charge") is positive, the probability of channel opening should increase from 0 to 1 in a sigmoid fashion as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ becomes more positive. Figure $7-7 B$ shows the behavior of $P_{\mathrm{o}}$ for hypothetical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that simulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in real cells.

To summarize, Figure 7-7A shows that once a single channel is open, the current flowing through the open channel is linearly related to $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. Figure 7-7B shows that the likelihood that the channel is open depends on $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in a sigmoid fashion. The actual macroscopic current $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ depends on the number of channels $(N)$ in the area of membrane being sampled, the open probability, and the single channel current, as we already pointed out in Equation 6-21:

$$
I_{\mathrm{X}}=N P_{\mathrm{o}} I_{\mathrm{X}}
$$

Thus, we can use Equation 7-4 to compute the macroscopic currents (I) contributed by our hypothetical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. We merely multiply the number of channels (which we assume to be 100 for both cations), the open probability for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in Figure 7-7B, and the single channel currents for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in Figure 7-7A. If we compare the resulting hypothetical $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $I_{\mathrm{K}}$ curves in Figure 7-7C, which are based on a simple theory, with actual data on macroscopic $I-V$ relationships (see Fig. 7-6D), we see
that this model provides a reasonable description of voltagesensitive ionic currents.

## The Hodgkin-Huxley model predicts macroscopic currents and the shape of the action potential

Even before the concepts of single channels and channel proteins emerged, Hodgkin and Huxley in 1952 formulated voltage-dependent and time-dependent parameters to predict the ionic currents that underlie the action potential of the squid giant axon. Hodgkin and Huxley defined a series of three dimensionless parameters, $n, m$, and $h$, each of which can have a value between 0 and 1 . The activation parameter $n$ describes the probability that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are open (Fig. 7-8A). The activation parameter $m$ describes the probability that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are open (see Fig. 7-8B, blue curve). Because Hodgkin and Huxley observed that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current inactivates, they introduced the inactivation parameter $h$ to describe this process (see Fig. 7-8B, violet curve).

Hodgkin and Huxley developed an equation for total membrane current $\left(I_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ and used it to predict the shape of the action potential in the squid giant axon. $\bigcirc$ NO-7 Figure $7-8 C$ shows their predicted action potential, which is triggered by a brief depolarization. Figure $7-8 D$ shows an actual recording. The close agreement between the HodgkinHuxley (HH) theory and experimental results indicates that this model provides a reasonable description of nerve excitation. The fundamental observation of Hodgkin and Huxley was that an increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance causes the upswing or depolarizing phase of the action potential as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ rapidly approaches $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$, whereas inactivation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance and delayed activation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance underlie the repolarization of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ to its resting value near $E_{\mathrm{K}}$. The importance of the HH model in electrophysiology is that it was the first analysis to accurately describe the time course and voltage dependence of ionic currents that occur during an action potential.

In addition to delineating the basis of the action potential waveform, the HH model also explains threshold behavior and the refractory period. For an action potential to fire, an external stimulus must depolarize the membrane above threshold to activate a sufficient number of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. The external stimulus can come from an electrode, a synaptic event, or propagation of a depolarizing wave along the cell membrane. What determines whether a stimulus will be sufficient to reach the threshold $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ for firing of an action potential? The number of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels activated by the stimulus is determined by the voltage dependence of the activation process (i.e., $m$ parameter). Opposing the local depolarization that is produced by the current flowing through these $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are current losses that occur because of passive spread of the current through intracellular and extracellular fluid (see the discussion of cable theory on pp. 201-203). Also opposing depolarization is the hyperpolarizing effect of currents through any open $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels in the membrane. Thus, the threshold is the level of depolarization at which the depolarizing effect of the open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels becomes sufficiently self-reinforcing to overcome these opposing influences. Once threshold is reached, further activation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels rapidly drives $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ toward $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$.

# N7-6 Boltzmann Distribution of Voltage-Dependent Gating for Ion Channel Proteins 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

If a channel can exist only in a closed or open conformation, the sum of the channel's open probability $\left(P_{0}\right)$ and closed probability $\left(P_{c}\right)$ must be 1 , so that the equilibrium constant $K_{\text {eq }}$ is

$$
K_{\text {eq }}=\frac{[\text { Open }]}{[\text { Closed }]} \times \frac{P_{0}}{P_{0}}=\frac{P_{0}}{1-P_{0}}
$$

The first two equalities in the above equation are the same as Equation 7-3 in the text.

According to statistical mechanics, the relative probability that the channel is in the open versus the closed state $\left(P_{o} / P_{c}\right)$ is determined by the difference in free energy $\left(\Delta G\right)$ between the open state $\left(G_{0}\right)$ and closed state $\left(G_{c}\right)$ of the channel. By applying the Boltzmann distribution-a law of physical chemistry that describes the statistical distribution of states or chemical species in a chemical equilibrium-we find that

$$
\frac{P_{0}}{P_{0}}=\frac{P_{0}}{1-P_{0}}=\exp \left[\frac{-\Delta G}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right]
$$

Here, $k_{\mathrm{B}}$ is the Boltzmann constant $\left(1.381 \times 10^{-23} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~K}^{-1}\right)$ and $T$ is the absolute temperature. According to Equation NE 7-2, when half of the channels are open and half are closed (i.e., $P_{o}=0.5$ and $P_{o} / P_{c}=1$ ), $\Delta G$ must be zero. In other words, if the energy of the open state is the same as the energy of the closed state, there ought to be an equal number of channels in each state. The free energy $\Delta G$ for opening a voltage-gated channel may be thought of as a sum of two terms, a chemical free-energy difference $\left(\Delta G_{\text {chem }}\right)$ and an electrical free-energy difference $\left(\Delta G_{\text {elec }}\right)$. The $\Delta G_{\text {chem }}$ term describes the difference in free energy between the open and closed conformational states of a single channel protein in the absence of an applied electric field. The $\Delta G_{\text {elec }}$ term describes the energy expended when an electrically charged portion of the channel protein molecule is moved by the electric field as the channel opens. Thus, the total change in free energy for opening a voltage-gated channel is the sum of the chemical and electrical terms:

$$
\Delta G=\Delta G_{\text {chem }}+\Delta G_{\text {elec }}
$$

Note that this equation is similar to Equation 5-6, which we introduced to describe the electrochemical potential difference (i.e., $\Delta \bar{\mu}_{0}$ ) for a mole of ions X. (C) NS-3 The difference is that, here, we are applying Equation NE 7-3 to a single channel molecule. We already saw in Chapter 5 that the electrical term for a mole of $X$ is the product $z F V_{m}$, where $z$ is the valence and $F$ is the charge on a mole of particles. Likewise, the electrical term $\Delta G_{\text {elec }}$ for a single molecule is the product of the valence (z) of the moving portion of the channel protein (the "voltage sensor"), the elementary charge $\left(e_{0}=1.602 \times 10^{-19}\right.$ coulomb) and the applied membrane voltage, $V_{m}$. Thus,

$$
\Delta G=\Delta G_{\text {chem }}+z e_{0} V_{m}
$$

Note that $z e_{0} V_{m}$ is the energy required to move the charge of the channel's "voltage sensor" across the electric field of the whole membrane.

In deriving an expression for $P_{0}$, it is helpful to express $\Delta G_{\text {chem }}$ in electrical terms. As noted above, when half the channels are open and half are closed (i.e., $P_{o}=P_{c}=0.5$ ), $\Delta G$ is zero. Equation NE 7-4 thus becomes

$$
\begin{aligned}
0 & =\Delta G_{\text {chem }}+z e_{0} V_{0.5} \\
\Delta G_{\text {chem }} & =-z e_{0} V_{0.5}
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $V_{0.5}$ is the voltage at which $P_{0}$ is 0.5 . Combining Equations NE 7-4 and NE 7-5, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta G & =-z e_{0} V_{0.5}+z e_{0} V_{m} \\
\Delta G & =z e_{0}\left(V_{m}-V_{0.5}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Equation NE 7-6 may be substituted into Equation NE 7-2 and rearranged to yield the following expression for the dependence of open probability on voltage:

$$
P_{0}=\frac{1}{1+\exp \left[\frac{-z e_{0}\left(V_{m}-V_{0.5}\right)}{k_{\mathrm{B}} T}\right]}
$$

The above equation appears in the text as the inset to Figure 7-7B.

# N7-7 Classical Hodgkin-Huxley Model of the Action Potential 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The HH analysis follows basic principles similar to the simple two-state (i.e., closed-open) model of single channel gating that we described in Equation 7-3. The HH analysis provides a description of macroscopic currents for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(I_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$, but relates these macroscopic currents not to single channel currents but to the maximal conductance of the membrane to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}\left(\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$ or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ $(\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}})$. In the single channel/Boltzmann model, (5) N7-6 these maximal conductances would be achieved when $P_{\mathrm{s}}$ is 1 . Thus, $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}}$ or $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}}$ would be the product of the single channel conductance ( $g_{\mathrm{Na}}$ or $g_{\mathrm{K}}$ ) and the number of open channels ( N ). In the HH analysis, the probability of observing the maximal conductance is described by three empirical voltage-sensitive parameters, $m$ and $h$ for the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance and $n$ for the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance. Like $P_{\mathrm{s}}$ in the single channel/Boltzmann model, $m, h$, and $n$ vary between 0 and 1. The original HH equations for macroscopic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current are

$$
\begin{gathered}
I_{K}=n^{2} \overline{\mathrm{G}}_{K}\left(V_{m}-E_{K}\right) \\
I_{\mathrm{Na}}=m^{2} h \overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}}\left(V_{m}-E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

Here, $V_{m}$ is the membrane potential, $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ is the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

Hodgkin and Huxley used the parameter $n$ to describe the probability (which varies from 0 to 1 ) that an activating "particle" or gate is in a permissive configuration for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel opening. However, they found it necessary to use the fourth power of $n$ to account for the sigmoid-shaped time dependence (or lag phase) for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-current activation. The molecular interpretation of this $n^{2}$ dependence is that four independent activation (or gating) particles must be in a permissive state for a single channel to open.

Similarly, the $m^{2}$ parameter in Equation NE 7-9 is the probability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel opening. In molecular terms, this $m^{2}$ dependence states that three independent gating particles must be in a permissive configuration for opening to occur. In order to account for the inactivation phase of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current, Hodgkin and Huxley proposed that the channel has a separate inactivation gate described by the parameter $h$ in Equation NE 7-9. The $h$ parameter is defined as the probability (from 0 to 1 ) that the
channel is not inactivated. Thus, when $m$ and $h$ are both 1 , the current is maximal.

The $n, m$, and $h$ probability parameters of the HH model depend on $V_{m}$ according to a Boltzmann distribution function like that in (5) N7-6. The green curve in Figure 7-8A shows the steady-state dependence of the $n$ parameter (which governs $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}}$ ) on $V_{m}$, as derived by Hodgkin and Huxley. Because this parameter is measured at infinite time, it is represented as $n_{\mathrm{m}}$. Figure 7-8B shows the same for the two steady-state parameters that govern $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}}, m_{\mathrm{n}}$ (blue curve) and $h_{\mathrm{n}}$ (red curve). The dependence of $n_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $m_{\mathrm{n}}$ on $V_{m}$ determines the voltage range for activation of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$currents, respectively. The $h_{\mathrm{n}}$ parameter for inactivation of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current spans a voltage range that is more negative than activation described by the $m_{\mathrm{n}}$ parameter. Thus, any voltage capable of activating the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel also promotes inactivation. The reason $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are able to open first, before closing, is that once a depolarization is initiated, activation occurs faster than inactivation. (Note that the $m_{\mathrm{n}}$ and $h_{\mathrm{n}}$ parameters describe $m$ and $h$ at infinite time and make no statement about how rapidly $m$ reaches $m_{\mathrm{n}}$, or $h$ reaches $h_{\mathrm{n}}!$ )

In their analysis of the squid axon action potential, Hodgkin and Huxley modeled the axon membrane as an equivalent electrical circuit that included $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}}$ and $\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}}$-which we have just discussed-as well as a leak component $\left(\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$-which corresponds to unspecified ohmic background conductance attributable to other types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels-and a membrane capacitance $\left(C_{m}\right)$. The HH theory predicts that the total membrane current $\left(I_{m}\right)$ is a sum of the capacitative current and the various ionic currents (see Equation 6-19 in the text). For the HH model,
$I_{m}=C_{m}\left(d V_{m} / d B+\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{K}} n^{4}\left(V_{m}-E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)+\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{Na}} m^{2} h\left(V_{m}-E_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)+\overline{\mathrm{G}}_{\mathrm{L}}\left(V_{m}-E_{\mathrm{L}}\right)\right.$
(NE 7-10)
Hodgkin and Huxley used this equation to predict the shape of the action potential in the squid giant axon. A comparison of their prediction (see Fig. 7-8C) with an actual record of an action potential from the squid giant axon (see Fig. 7-8D) shows that their theory does a very good job of describing this phenomenon.

Figure 7-8 Voltage-dependent parameters of the HH model and their use in predicting the shape of the action potential. A, The $n$ parameter describes the probability that each of four "particles" in the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is in the proper state for channel opening. It is believed that these four particles are the gates of the four $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel subunits. The parameter plotted here is the value of $n$ at infinite time. B, The $m$ parameter describes the probability that each of three particles in the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel is in the proper state for channel opening. The $h$ parameter describes the probability that an inactivation particle is not in the proper state for inactivating the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. Thus, a high $h$ favors the open state of the channel. The parameters plotted here are the values of $m$ and $h$ at infinite time. C, Hodgkin and Huxley used data similar to those in $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ to compute the time course of an action potential in the squid giant axon. D, The actual data are very similar to the computed action potential in C. (Data from Hodgkin AL, Huxley AF: A quantitative description of membrane current and its application to conduction and excitation in nerve. J Physiol 117:500-544, 1952.)

The basis of the absolute refractory period, the time during which a second action potential cannot occur under any circumstances, is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel inactivation. In other words, it is impossible to recruit a sufficient number of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels to generate a second spike unless previously activated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels have recovered from inactivation (i.e., $h$ parameter), a process that takes several milliseconds. The relative refractory period, during which a stronger than normal stimulus is required to elicit a second action potential, depends largely on delayed $K^{+}$channel opening (i.e., $n$ parameter). In other words, for a certain period after the peak of the action potential, the increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance tends to hyperpolarize the membrane, so a stronger depolarizing stimulus is required to activate the population of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels that in the meantime have recovered from inactivation.

Another key feature of the HH model is that it implies that $V_{\text {in }}$ activates a channel by inducing the movement of an electrically charged gating particle or voltage sensor across the membrane. Physically, this gating could occur by the movement of a charged portion of the channel protein through all or part of the transmembrane electrical field or by the reorientation of an electrical dipole (a neutral structure with positive and negative polarity) within the electrical field of the membrane. Thus, the HH model correctly predicted that activation of a voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel should be accompanied by a small movement of gating charge, which should produce a gating current. (o) N7-8 This prediction was satisfied in 1973 when Armstrong and Bezanilla recorded a very small, rapid outward current that is activated by depolarization in a voltage-clamped squid axon in which the ionic current of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels is completely blocked by TTX (see Fig. 7-5C, bottom $I_{\mathrm{in}}$ record). This tiny, transient gating current is almost finished by the time that the slower $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current begins to flow. The properties of such gating currents account for the voltage dependence of channel activation kinetics. Although the key features of the HH theory are correct, modern patch-clamp studies of single $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels have revealed that the kinetics of channel gating are much more complicated than originally assumed. Such complexity is to be expected inasmuch as the conformational dynamics of large protein molecules cannot generally be described adequately by simple models that incorporate only a few discrete states.

## PHYSIOLOGY OF VOLTAGE-GATED CHANNELS AND THEIR RELATIVES

## A large superfamily of structurally related membrane proteins includes voltage-gated and related channels

Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are part of a superfamily of channel proteins called the voltage-gated-like (VGL) ion channel superfamily (see Table 6-2). This superfamily also includes structurally related channels that are not strictly activated by voltage. Figure 7-9 shows a dendrogram based on an analysis of evolutionary relationships of the minimal pore regions of 143 human channels belonging to the VGL superfamily. Major branches of the tree define groups of related channel genes present in

# N7-8 Evidence for Gating Currents 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Two groups of investigators, working on two different preparations, nearly simultaneously discovered the gating currents predicted 2 decades earlier by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley. In a paper published in March 1973, Martin Schneider and W. Knox Chandler demonstrated the presence of a gating current for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in frog skeletal muscle. In a paper published in April 1973, Clay Armstrong and Pancho Bezanilla demonstrated the presence of a gating current for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in squid giant axons.

the human genome. In this section, we discuss how structural relationships among these proteins determine their physiological functions.

Initial progress toward biochemical characterization of the voltage-gated ion channels responsible for the action potential began with the discovery of naturally occurring, specific, high-affinity neurotoxins such as TTX and STX and their use as biochemical probes. Tritium-labeled derivatives of TTX and STX were prepared chemically and used in radioligand-binding assays to directly measure the number of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in excitable tissues.

The electroplax organ of the electric eel Electrophorus electricus (D) N7-9 proved to be a convenient source of tissue for the first successful biochemical purification of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel protein by William Agnew and coworkers in 1978. These $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels consist of a large glycosylated $\alpha$ subunit of $\sim 200 \mathrm{kDa}$ that contains the TTX-binding site. Reconstitution experiments revealed that the $\alpha$ subunit-by
itself-is the channel-forming protein that mediates ionic selectivity for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, voltage-dependent gating, and pharmacological sensitivity to various neurotoxins. Similar approaches with skeletal muscle and brain led to the identification of analogous mammalian $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel $\alpha$ subunits, which are protein products of related genes.

In addition to the $\alpha$ subunit, the functional complex of the rat skeletal muscle $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel contains a $38-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit, and the rat brain $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel contains both a 33 - and a $36-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit. These smaller $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ subunits of mammalian $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels contain a single transmembrane span and appear to play an accessory role in modulating channel gating or channel expression. In humans, four genes (SCN1B to SCN4B) encode $\beta$ subunits- $\beta_{1}$ to $\beta_{4}$-that preferentially associate with different $\alpha$ subunits in different tissues.

Molecular biological studies of voltage-gated channels began in 1984 with the cloning of the Electrophorus $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$

# N7-9 Electroplax Organ of the Electric Eel 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The electroplax organ of the electric eel (Electrophorus electricus) is composed of specialized cells called electrocytes that are an evolutionary adaptation of skeletal muscle cells. The innervated membrane face of the electrocytes contains a high density of both nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. Thus, this tissue is a rich source of both proteins. Indeed, for both proteins, this tissue played a key role in the purification, biochemical characterization, reconstitution into lipid membranes, and physiological characterization.

Figure 7-10 Membrane topology model of a single subunit of a voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. A, This voltagedependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, a member of the Shaker family ( $\mathrm{Kv} 1.1$ ), has six transmembrane segments ( S 1 to S 6 ) with a high hydropathy index. Each of these six segments (highlighted in green or yellow) is presumed to traverse the membrane completely. In addition, the channel also has a smaller region (highlighted in red) with a somewhat lower hydropathy index, termed the P region. B, This topology model is based on the hydropathy data in $\mathbf{A}$. The six membrane-spanning segments are assumed to be $\alpha$ helices. The S 4 segment (highlighted in yellow) has a large number of positively charged lysine and arginine residues and is part of the voltage-sensing domain that comprises the entire S1 to S4 region. S5 and S6-as well as the intervening P region-comprise the S5-P-S6 pore domain (see Fig. 7-11).

channel $\alpha$ subunit by the laboratory of Shosaku Numa. These investigators used antibodies raised against the purified $\alpha$ subunit to screen a complementary DNA (cDNA) library, and they isolated the cDNA encoding the electroplax $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. In addition, direct sequencing of channel peptides provided partial amino-acid sequence information for confirmation. Similar strategies led to the purification and cloning of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel proteins from skeletal muscle and brain tissue. The primary sequence of the $\alpha_{1}$ subunit of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel is structurally homologous to the $\alpha$ subunit of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel.

Whereas a biochemical approach was used to discover $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, the initial breakthrough in the molecular biology of $\mathbf{K}^{+}$channels came with the study of Shaker mutants of the fruit fly Drosophila. These mutants are called Shaker because their bodies literally shake under the influence of ether anesthesia. This phenotype is due to defective voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The laboratory of L.Y. Jan and Y.N. Jan, and those of O. Pongs and M. Tanouye, used molecular genetic techniques to identify and clone the first $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel genes in 1987.

For voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, plots based on the hydropathy index of each amino acid (see Table 2-1) typically reveal six distinct peaks of hydrophobicity (Fig. 7-10A), corresponding to transmembrane segments S 1 to S 6 -a conserved structural feature of all voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Transmembrane segments S 1 to S 6 have an $\alpha$-helical secondary
structure and are connected by cytoplasmic and extracellular linker regions (see Fig. 7-10B).

Extensive mutagenesis studies on cloned channel genes have associated various channel functions and binding properties with particular domains. The amino-terminal part of the channel, including the S1 to S4 transmembrane segments, forms a voltage-sensing domain (see Fig. 7-10B). The $\mathbf{S 4}$ segment has four to seven arginine or lysine residues that occur at every third S 4 residue in voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The positively charged S 4 segment acts as the voltage sensor for channel activation by moving outward when the membrane depolarizes. This movement causes the four S6 helices-which form the inner lining of the pore-to bend away from the pore axis, thereby opening the channel.

The extracellular linker region between the S5 and S6 segments is termed the $\mathbf{P}$ region (for pore region) and contains residues that form the binding sites for toxins and external blocking molecules such as TEA. The pore domain formed by S5-P-S6 is the minimal structure required to form an ion-conducting pore for this class of channels (see Fig. 7-10B). The P region also contains conserved residues that form the selectivity filter, which determines the ionic selectivity for permeant cations. (C) N7-10

# N7-10 Selectivity Filter 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Evidence from mutational and structural analysis has revealed the basic mechanism by which voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels discriminate permeant ions. In the case of $\mathrm{Kv} \mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, four selective binding sites for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$are formed within cages of eight oxygen atoms from the peptide backbone and hydroxyl groups of Thr (see Table 2-1 for amino-acid code). In $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, the carboxyl groups from the side chains of four negatively charged Glu residues-called the EEEE locus-form two binding sites for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels have a selectivity filter similar to that of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, but contain a conserved DEKA locus, consisting of Asp, Glu, Lys, and Ala residues.

B, Side view of the four $\alpha$ and four $\beta$ subunits of the channel, each in a different color, with extracellular solution on the top and intracellular solution on the bottom. The transmembrane domain (TM) of each $\alpha$ subunit is preceded by an $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ terminus (T1 domain). The T 1 domain is located over the intracellular entryway to the pore but allows access of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions to the pore through side portals. The T 1 domain is also a docking platform for the oxidoreductase $\beta$ subunit. Each $\beta$ subunit is colored according to the $\alpha$ subunit it contacts.

Tetramers of segments S5, pore helix, and S6 constitute the conduction pore in the shape of an inverted "teepee." The selectivity filter lies in the wide portion (extracellular end) of the teepee. Helices S1 to S4 constitute the voltage sensors that are connected by a linker helix (S4-S5) to the pore. The PVP sequence (Pro-Val-Pro) on S6 is critical for gating.

channel proteins. (○) N7-11 In 1998, a major breakthrough in elucidating the structure of ion channel proteins occurred when MacKinnon and colleagues reported the crystal structure of a bacterial $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel protein called KcsA. This work revealed the three-dimensional structure of a protein that contained segments analogous to the S5-P-S6 part of voltage-gated channels, which forms the ion conduction pathway. For his work on the structural biology of ion channels, Roderick MacKinnon shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (○) N7-12

In 2005, the MacKinnon laboratory solved the structure of a mammalian voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel containing both the S 1 to S 4 voltage-sensing domain and the S5-P-S6 pore domain (Fig. 7-11). (○) N7-13

Figure 7-12 shows a comparison of the predicted membrane-folding diagrams of three families of voltagegated channels: $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The channelforming subunit of each type of channel is called the $\alpha$ subunit for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and the $\alpha_{1}$ subunit for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Accessory subunits include $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels; $\alpha_{2}, \delta, \beta$, and $\gamma$, for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels; and $\beta$ for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels.

The $\alpha$ subunit of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 7-12A) and the $\alpha_{1}$ subunit of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see Fig. 7-12B) consist of four internally homologous repeats-domains I, II, III, and IVeach containing an S 1 to S 6 motif composed of the S 1 to S 4 voltage-sensing domain and the S5-P-S6 pore domain. In contrast, voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 7-12C) are homotetramers of four identical $\alpha$ subunits (see p. 162), whereas $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are pseudotetramers. Molecular evolution of the pseudotetrameric I to IV domain structure of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels is believed to have
occurred by consecutive gene duplication of a primordial gene encoding a structure similar to the basic S1 to S6 motif of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels.

## $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels generate the rapid initial depolarization of the action potential

Because the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is in the positive voltage range for normal cellular ionic gradients, channels that are selectively permeable to these ions mediate electrical depolarization. However, prolonged cellular depolarization is an adverse condition inasmuch as it results in sustained contraction and rigor of muscle fibers, cardiac dysfunction, and abnormally elevated levels of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which leads to cell death. Thus, it is critical that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels normally reside in a closed conformation at the resting membrane potential. Their opening is an intrinsically transient process that is determined by the kinetics of channel activation and inactivation.

The primary role of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels is to produce the initial depolarizing phase of fast action potentials in neurons and skeletal and cardiac muscle. The selectivity of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is much higher than that for other alkali cations. The permeability ratio of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$relative to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ $\left(P_{\mathrm{Na}} / P_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ lies in the range of 11 to 20 under physiological conditions. Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are virtually impermeable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and other divalent cations under normal physiological conditions.

Although $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels do not significantly conduct $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions across the cell membrane, the voltage dependence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel gating is nevertheless dependent on the extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$. If $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ is

## N7-13 Crystal Structures of a Vertebrate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Channel


#### Abstract

Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski In 2005, the MacKinnon laboratory solved the crystal structure of a rat voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel called Kv1.2, which is homologous to the Drosophila Shaker channel and human $\mathrm{Kv} 1 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$channels that function in repolarization of nerve and muscle action potentials. This structure, which shows the channel in an open state, reveals that the S 1 to S 4 domain containing the voltage-sensing S4 element is spatially separated from the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$pore domain (S5P-S6). The tetrameric Kv1.2 channel has a pinwheel shape when viewed from the extracellular surface (see Fig. 7-11A). The central square portion of the Kv1.2 pinwheel is the pore-formed by the assembly of four S5-P-S6 pore domains, one from each monomer-and closely resembles the entire bacterial KcsA (5) N7-22 channel. The four wings of the pinwheel correspond to the four S1 to S4 voltage-sensor domains. The four Kv1.2 monomers (yellow, green, blue, and red in Fig. 7-11A) form an interlinked assembly in which the S1 to S4 voltage-sensing domain of any given monomer lies closest to the S5-P-S6 domain of an adjacent monomer.

A lateral view of Kv1.2 shows an intracellular T1 domain formed by the four N-terminal segments of the channel (see Fig. 7-11B). The T1 domain of Kv channels is also called the tetramerization domain because it helps assemble and maintain the tetrameric structure of the channel. This view also shows four separately attached intracellular $\beta$ subunits (see p. 183). These $\beta$ subunits of Kv channels are part of a separate gene family of soluble accessory proteins with structural homology to oxidoreductase enzymes. Certain variants of both the T1 domain and $\beta$ subunits may contain an N -terminal inactivation peptide that produces the rapid N-type inactivation (ball-and-chain mechanism) of some Kv channels by plugging the intracellular entrance to the pore.

Figure 7-11C shows a lateral view of a single Kv1.2 monomer in an open configuration as well as a single $\beta$ subunit. On depolarization, the S4 segment moves within the membrane toward the extracellular side of the membrane. This mechanical movement of the S4 segment shifts an $\alpha$-helical S4-S5 linker, causing


a bending of the S6 transmembrane $\alpha$ helix from a linear configuration in the closed state to a curved configuration in the open state of the channel shown. Thus, voltage-dependent channel activation is an electromechanical coupling mechanism.

Other important features of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel function are revealed by crystal structures (not shown) of a Kir2.2 inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel from chicken and the C-terminal intracellular gating ring of the $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Cs}}(\mathrm{KCa} 1.1)$ large-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Kir2.2 structures show the location of the $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ lipid-binding site in the inner leaflet of the lipid bilayer at the interface between the pore domain and the cytoplasmic domain. $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ stabilizes the interaction of these two protein domains to favor opening of the channel, corresponding to the mechanism of activation of Kir channels by $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$.

Crystal structures (not shown) of the intracellular gating ring domain of the human $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Cs}}$ channel show a tetrameric assembly of two tandem C-terminal regulator of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance domains (RCK1 and RCK2 domains). A region of the RCK2 domain rich in Asp residues called the calcium bowl forms four $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding sites, one from each $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Cs}}$ channel subunit. Binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to these sites located at the interface between RCK domains facilitates conformational changes of the gating ring that favor channel opening. Detailed structural analyses of channel proteins help us to understand how genetic defects and drugs affect channel function.

# N7-22 Crystal Structure of the KcsA K ${ }^{+}$Channel 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

In 1998, the laboratory of Roderick MacKinnon at Rockefeller University used x-ray diffraction to solve the three-dimensional crystal structure of a membrane protein known as KcsA. KcsA is the protein product of a gene from the actinomycete bacterium Streptomyces lividans. KcsA is homologous to the S5-P-S6 region of the Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and is known to function as a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in planar bilayer membranes. KcsA lacks the S1 to S4 voltagesensing region and consists of a pore-forming domain equivalent to that of the vertebrate inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel gene family (Kir), which we discuss in this chapter. As is the case for the Shaker-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, KcsA is a homotetramer. The P -region sequence of KcsA is very similar to the P region of the Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, which contains amino-acid residues critical for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity, as well as extracellular sensitivity to blockade by TEA and charybdotoxin. The accompanying eFigure 7-1 shows a ribbon diagram representation of the structure of KcsA, in one view looking down from the top of the membrane (see eFig. 7-1A) and in a second view looking from the side (see eFig. 7-1B). Each of the four monomer subunits of the protein is shown in a different color. Starting from the intracellular N terminus, the first transmembrane span ("outer helix," corresponding to Shaker S5) forms an $\alpha$ helix that serves as the periphery of the channel. After crossing the membrane to the extracellular side, the peptide backbone then forms a loop that corresponds to the $\mathbf{P}$ region. The first half of this loop is a short $\alpha$ helix that folds back a short distance into the plane of the membrane and then immediately exits the extracellular side of the membrane. In the tetrameric complex that constitutes the channel protein, this latter
portion of the P loop forms a narrow tunnel-like region called the ion selectivity filter. After exiting the extracellular face of the membrane, the peptide backbone turns again to form a third $\alpha$ helix ("inner helix," corresponding to Shaker S6) that crosses the membrane to the intracellular side. The four inner helices of the tetramer form the scaffold of the ion channel pore. These four inner helices are tilted in a remarkable flower-like configuration that has also been compared to four poles of an inverted teepee tent dwelling.

The KcsA structure reveals the molecular basis for the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel pores. The selectivity filter region is lined not by the side chains of amino acids, but rather by four rings of carbonyl oxygen atoms contributed by the peptide backbone of four aminoacid residues in the P region. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions in the 12- $\AA$-long selectivity filter (near the extracellular surface of the channel) are bound in a cage by coordination to oxygen atoms contributed by each of the four subunits. This cage is just the right size for a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion. A smaller $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion would fit too loosely, so its binding in the cage would not be energetically favorable in comparison to its binding to water in its normal hydrated state. eFigure 7-1C is a cutaway surface view of the pore showing the location of three $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions in the crystal structure. Up to seven distinct binding sites for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$have been identified in high-resolution studies of the KcsA pore. The presence of multiple $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions in the pore is consistent with the results of many electrophysiological studies, which suggest that multiple $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions move through the channel in single file.

For his work on the structural biology of ion channels, Roderick MacKinnon shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (C) N7-12

A, A voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel (Nav) is made up of a pseudo-oligomeric $\alpha$ subunit as well as membrane-spanning $\beta_{1}$ and $\beta_{2}$ subunits. B, A voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel ( Cav ) is made up of a pseudo-oligomeric $\alpha_{1}$ subunit as well as an extracellular $\alpha_{2}$ subunit, a cytoplasmic $\beta$ subunit (not shown in left panel), and membrane-spanning $\gamma$ and $\delta$ subunits. Note that the domains I to IV of the Nav and Cav $\alpha$ subunits are homologous to a single subunit of a voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel (see C). C, A voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is made up of four $\alpha$ subunits as well as four cytoplasmic $\beta$ subunits (not shown in left panel).

progressively increased above the normal physiological level, the voltage activation range of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels progressively shifts to more positive voltages. In Figure 7-13 this change is represented as a shift in the $P_{\mathrm{o}}$ versus $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ relationship. Similarly, if $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ is decreased, the voltage activation range is shifted to more negative voltages. This phenomenon has important clinical implications because a negative shift
corresponds to a reduced voltage threshold for action potential firing and results in hyperexcitability and spontaneous muscle twitching. Similarly, a positive voltage shift of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel gating corresponds to decreased electrical excitability (i.e., the threshold is now farther away from resting $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ ), resulting in muscle weakness. Thus, metabolic disorders that result in abnormal plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, such as

hypoparathyroidism (low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ ) and hyperparathyroidism (high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ ), can cause marked neurological and neuromuscular symptoms. The mechanism of this voltage shift in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel gating by extracellular divalent cations such as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is thought to involve an alteration in the transmembrane electrical field that is sensed by the channel protein. Presumably, this effect is caused by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding or electrostatic screening of negative charges at the membrane surface.

Humans have 10 homologous genes (Table 7-1) that encode the pore-forming $\alpha$ subunit of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels (Navs). The isoforms encoded by these genes are expressed in different excitable tissues and can be partially discriminated on the basis of their sensitivity to TTX. Four of the isoforms (Nav1.1, 1.2, 1.3, and 1.6) are differentially expressed in various regions of the brain. Nav1.4 and Nav1.5 are the major isoforms in skeletal and cardiac muscle, respectively. A divergent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel gene Nax (SCN7A) functions as a homeostatic sensor of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in circumventricular organs of the brain (see pp. 284-285).

## $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are blocked by neurotoxins and local anesthetics

Studies of the mechanism of action of neurotoxins have provided important insight into channel function and structure. The guanidinium toxins TTX and STX (see Fig. 7-5C) are specific blocking agents of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels that act on the extracellular side of the cell membrane.

TTX is produced by certain bacteria and is accumulated in tissues of various marine invertebrates, amphibians, and fish. The viscera of the Fugu pufferfish consumed in Japan often contain lethal amounts of TTX. The flesh of such fish must be carefully prepared to prevent food poisoning.

STX is produced by specific species of marine dinoflagellates that are responsible for "red tide" in the ocean as well as by freshwater cyanobacteria, which can poison ponds and rivers. It is the agent responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, which is caused by human ingestion of toxic shellfish that have accumulated STX-producing plankton. Death from TTX and STX intoxication, which ultimately results from respiratory paralysis, can be prevented by the timely initiation of mechanical ventilation.

Venomous marine snails of the Conus genus produce a variety of peptides that target ion channels. The $\boldsymbol{\mu}$-conotoxins (1) N7-14 block muscle $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels by binding near the external binding site for TTX and STX.

TTX, STX, and $\mu$-conotoxins are important pharmacological probes because they can be used to functionally discriminate among several distinct isoforms of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see Table 7-1). Other important neurotoxins that act on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels include batrachotoxin (a steroidal alkaloid from certain tropical frogs and birds), various plant alkaloids (veratridine, grayanotoxin, aconitine), natural plant insecticides (pyrethrins), brevetoxins (cyclic polyethers from dinoflagellates), $\alpha$ and $\beta$ scorpion peptide toxins, and peptide toxins from tarantulas. Some of these neurotoxins are stimulatory, acting primarily by altering gating kinetics, so that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are open at voltages in which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are normally closed or inactivated. Others block the channel by stabilizing the voltage sensor in the resting (i.e., channelclosed) conformation.

Local anesthetics are a large group of synthetic drugs that are generally characterized by an aromatic moiety linked to a tertiary amine substituent via an ester or amide linkage (Fig. 7-14A). Drug development of local anesthetics began in the late 1800s with the recognition by Karl Koller and Sigmund Freud that the plant alkaloid cocaine numbs sensation in the tongue and suppresses eye movement during ophthalmological procedures, in addition to having psychoactive effects on the central nervous system (CNS). Attempts to synthesize safer alternatives to cocaine led to procaine, which mimics the local anesthetic effect of cocaine without the CNS effects.

Local anesthetics that are used clinically, such as procaine, lidocaine, and tetracaine, reversibly block nerve impulse generation and propagation by inhibiting voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels. The action of these drugs is "use dependent," which means that inhibition of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current progresses in a timedependent manner with increasing repetitive stimulation or firing of action potentials (see Fig. 7-14B). Use dependence occurs because the drug binds most effectively only after the

The $\mu$-conotoxins are specific blockers of the subtype of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels that are present in adult skeletal muscle (Nav1.4). This conclusion can be verified by performing a simple electrophysiological experiment on a "nervemuscle" preparation consisting of a motor nerve and the attached skeletal muscle fibers. The approach is to record the membrane potential of a muscle fiber membrane while artificially stimulating the preparation with a brief electrical depolarization applied either to the nerve or directly to the muscle. In a normal preparation, either stimulus is able to evoke a muscle action potential. However, in a preparation exposed to $\mu$-conotoxin, one observes no response when stimulating the muscle fiber directly but observes a graded postsynaptic potential in the end-plate region when stimulating the nerve directly. This latter response demonstrates that $\mu$-conotoxin does not affect either the motor nerve or the neuromuscular junction (e.g., the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at the motor end plate).

# BOX 7-1 Genetic Defects of Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels 

Adiverse spectrum of human genetic diseases has been mapped to inheritable defects in the $\alpha$-subunit genes for voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (see Table 7-1). Genetic diseases have been linked to five different Nav genes: SCN4A (Nav1.4) expressed in skeletal muscle, SCN5A expressed in the heart (Nav1.5), and three genes-SCN1A (Nav1.1), SCN2A (Nav1.2), and SCN9A (Nav1.7)—expressed in central and peripheral neurons.

One disorder of skeletal muscle resulting from mutations in Nav1.4 is called hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP or HyperPP) because muscle weakness is triggered by an elevation in serum $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$that may occur after vigorous exercise or ingestion of foods rich in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. A second Nav1.4-linked muscle disorder is called paramyotonia congenita (PC). This form of periodic paralysis may be induced in affected individuals by exposure to cold temperature and results in symptoms of myotonia (muscle
stiffness) associated with abnormal repetitive firing of muscle action potentials.

Long QT syndromes comprise a diverse number of inherited defects in heart rhythm that can lead to sudden death from cardiac arrhythmias, including ventricular fibrillation. Long QT refers to lengthening of the duration of the cardiac action potential as measured by the QT interval on the electrocardiogram (see p. 506). One form of these syndromes, classified as LQT3, is the result of a deletion of three amino acids, $\triangle \mathrm{KPQ}$, in the linker region between repetitive domains III and IV of the Nav1.5 heart $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. Many other LQT3 mutations of Nav1.5 have been mapped in affected families. Genetic defects in various cardiac $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels also cause long QT syndromes as described in Box 7-3.

Mutations in two different Nav channels expressed in the brain result in syndromes called generalized epilepsy with

# BOX 7-1 Genetic Defects of Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels-cont'd 

febrile seizures plus (GEFS+; Nav1.1) and infantile epileptic encephalopathy (Nav1.2).

Certain defects in Nav1.7 in peripheral nerves result in a variety of syndromes that alter pain perception (nociception). Various single amino-acid replacements in Nav1.7 result in syndromes of heightened and severe sensitivity to pain-primary erythemalgia (PE) or familial erythromelalgia (N7-21 (from the Greek erythros [red] + melos [limb] + algos [pain]) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder (PEPD). Conversely, the absence of functional expression of this channel by nonsense
mutation prevents action potential firing in sensory afferent nociceptive neurons, resulting in a complete inability to perceive pain-channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain (CIP). Thus, the development of drugs that selectively block Nav1.7 channels could lead to a new class of pain medications.

Figure 7-15 illustrates the location of various Nav mutations mapped onto a membrane topology diagram of a generic Nav channel. Most of these Nav mutations cause hyperexcitability of nerve or muscle due to altered voltage-dependent gating kinetics, resulting in excessive or prolonged channel opening.
![bo1954543376c](bo1954543376c.jpg)

Figure 7-15 $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel mutations in human genetic diseases. The topology diagram shows a few examples of locations of mutations mapped in three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel genes for six human genetic channelopathy diseases. Symbols show sites on a generic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel $\alpha$ subunit. All these disease mutations are missense mutations resulting in amino-acid changes or deletions except for channelopathy-associated insensitivity to pain, which is due to nonsense mutations that result in lack of functional Nav1.7 expression. (Data from Catterall WA: Cellular and molecular biology of voltage-gated sodium channels. Physiol Rev 72:S15-S48, 1992; Ashcroft FM: Ion Channels and Disease, Academic Press, 2000; and Drenth JPH, Waxman S: Mutations in sodiumchannel gene SCN9A cause a spectrum of human genetic pain disorders. J Clin Invest 117:3606-3609, 2007.)

$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel has already opened. This use-dependent action of the drug further enhances inhibition of nerve impulses at sites where repetitive firing of action potentials takes place. Local anesthetics are widely used to control pain during dental procedures, many types of minor surgery, and labor in childbirth.

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels contribute to action potentials in some cells and also function in electrical and chemical coupling mechanisms

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels play important roles in the depolarization phase of certain action potentials, in coupling electrical excitation to secretion or muscle contraction, and in other signal-transduction processes. Because $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ is $\sim 1.2 \mathrm{mM}$, whereas resting $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is only $\sim 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$, a huge gradient favors the passive influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into cells. At the relatively high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ that prevails under physiological conditions, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are highly selective for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, with
permeability to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ being $\sim 1000$-fold greater than permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Other alkaline earth divalent cations such as $\mathrm{Sr}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ also readily permeate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and are often used as substitute ions for recording the activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in electrophysiological studies. However, if $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ is experimentally reduced to a nonphysiological level of $<10^{-6}$ M with the use of chelating agents, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels can also conduct large currents of monovalent alkali cations, such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Thus, in terms of its intrinsic ionic selectivity, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel is functionally similar to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, except that high-affinity binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the pore effectively prevents permeation of all other physiological ions except $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The mechanism of this extraordinary selectivity behavior is based on ion-ion interactions within the selectivity filter of the pore. (N7-10 For the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel to conduct current, at least two $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions must bind simultaneously. This general mechanism, referred to as multi-ion conduction, also applies to many other classes of ion channels, notably

# N7-21 Erythromelalgia or Primary Erythermalgia 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Certain defects in the human gene SCN8A, which encodes the peripheral nerve $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel Nav1.7, result in a variety of syndromes that alter pain perception. The absence of functional expression of this channel by nonsense mutation results in complete insensitivity to pain. Various single amino-acid replacements due to missense mutations of the channel gene result in gain-of-function syndromes that lead to heightened and severe sensitivity to pain known as primary erythemalgia or erythromelalgia (from the Greek erythros [red] + melos [limb] + algos [pain]) and paroxysmal extreme pain disorder. These findings suggest that Nav1.7 may be a good target in the search for new drugs for the treatment of pain.

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Multi-ion conduction generally plays an important role in determining the permeation properties of channels with a high ionic selectivity, such as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels.

Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels contribute to the depolarizing phase of action potentials in certain cell types. Notably, the gating of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels is slower than that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. Whereas $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are most important in initiating action potentials and generating rapidly propagating spikes in axons, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels often give rise to a more sustained depolarizing current, which is the basis for the long-lived action potentials in cardiac cells, smooth-muscle cells, secretory cells, and many types of neurons.

The exquisite selectivity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels under physiological conditions endows them with special roles in cellular regulation. When activated by a depolarizing electrical stimulus or a signal-transduction cascade, these $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels mediate an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Thus, in serving as a major gateway for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels not only contribute to membrane depolarization but also play a role in signal transduction because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is an important second messenger (see p. 60).
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels also play a pivotal role in a special subset of signal-transduction processes known as excitationcontraction coupling and excitation-secretion coupling. Excitation-contraction (EC) coupling refers to the process by which an electrical depolarization at the cell membrane leads to cell contraction, such as the contraction of a skeletal muscle fiber. In EC coupling of skeletal muscle (see p. 229), one class of plasma-membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel that is located in the transverse tubule membrane of skeletal muscle serves as the voltage sensor and forms a direct mechanical linkage to intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels that are located in the
sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane. In contrast, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels play a different role in EC coupling in cardiac muscle, where $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane mediate an initial influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The resultant increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ triggers an additional release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stored in the SR by a process known as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see pp. 242-243).

Excitation-secretion (ES) coupling is the process by which depolarization of the plasma membrane causes release of neurotransmitters in the nervous system and the secretion of hormones in the endocrine system. Such processes require an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to trigger exocytosis of synaptic and secretory vesicles.

In keeping with the diverse roles of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, the human genome contains 10 distinct genes (Table 7-2) for the channel-forming $\alpha_{1}$ subunit of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (Cavs). Molecular studies have also identified four accessory subunits of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels: $\alpha_{2}, \delta, \beta$, and $\gamma$ (see Fig. 7-12B). A single gene gives rise to the $\alpha_{2}$ and $\delta$ subunits, which are separated by proteolytic cleavage. Coexpression studies show that these accessory subunits can greatly influence the kinetics, voltage sensitivity, and peak currents exhibited by various $\alpha_{1}$ channel subunits. Table 7-2 shows that the genetic diversity is mirrored by a diversity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents in various cell types.

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are characterized as L-, T-, P/0-, N-, and R-type channels on the basis of kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivity

An example of the functional diversity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels is illustrated in Figure 7-16, which shows two different types of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that have been identified in

Figure 7-16 Current records from two types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel. A, Data from an experiment using cell-attached patches on guinea pig ventricular myocytes are shown. These currents are carried by $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, which conduct $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$ even better than $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Shown in the middle panel are seven single channel current records obtained during and after a shift of the cytosolic voltage from -50 to +10 mV . Channel activity (i.e., downward deflections) begins only after depolarization and continues more or less at the same level throughout the depolarization. The lower panel shows the average of many records that are similar to those shown in the middle panel. B, The experiments yielding the data shown for T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are identical in design to those in $\mathbf{A}$, except for the depolarizing step. Again, channel activity begins only after depolarization (middle panel). However, channel activity is transient, waning during a sustained depolarization, as confirmed by the average current shown in the lower panel. (Data from Nilius B, Hess P, Lansman JB, Tsien RW: A novel type of cardiac calcium channel in ventricular cells. Nature 316:443-446, 1985.)
cardiac ventricular cells by the patch-clamp technique. If the cell-attached patch, initially clamped at -50 mV , is suddenly depolarized to +10 mV , currents appear from a largeconductance ( 18 to 25 pS ), slowly inactivating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (see Fig. 7-16A). However, if the same patch is initially clamped at -70 mV and depolarized to only -20 mV , currents appear instead from a small-conductance ( 8 pS ), rapidly inactivating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (see Fig. 7-16B). These two types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel are, respectively, named L-type (for long-lived) and T-type (for transient) channels. T-type channels are activated at a lower voltage threshold (more negative than -30 mV ) than are other types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and are also inactivated over a more negative voltage range. These characteristics of T-type channels permit them to function briefly in the initiation of action potentials and to play a role in the repetitive firing of cardiac cells and neurons. Other types of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, including L-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels, which are activated at a higher voltage threshold (more positive than -30 mV ), mediate the long-lived plateau phase of slow action potentials and provide a more substantial influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for contractile and secretory responses. N-, $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{Q}$-, and R-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels appear to mediate the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into certain types of presynaptic nerve terminals and thus play an important role in facilitating the release of neurotransmitters.

In addition to discrimination on the basis of gating behavior, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel isoforms can also be distinguished by their sensitivity to different drugs and toxins (see Table 7-2).

# BOX 7-2 Consequences of Genetically Defective $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Channels 

Given their significance in excitation-contraction and excitation-secretion coupling, mutations resulting in dysfunctional voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels would be expected to have many adverse physiological consequences. Here we describe Cav defects that perturb cardiac and neurological function. Cav mutations and related autoimmune disorders that specifically affect muscle are the focus of Box 9-1.

The L-type Cav1.2 channel is highly expressed in the heart but also in many other tissues. Mutations in the human CACNA1C gene for Cav1.2 are linked to two distinct genetic channelopathies: Timothy syndrome (LQT8) and a form of Brugada syndrome. Timothy syndrome is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with common features of syndactyly (fused fingers), autism, and long QT arrhythmia. The arrhythmia apparently reflects a gain of function resulting from defective Cav inactivation. Brugada syndrome, which also carries a risk of sudden cardiac death, is recognized by an abnormal pattern on electrocardiogram characterized by an elevated ST segment and shortened QT interval (see Fig. 21-7), or so-called short QT. Defects in at least six different human genes are linked to Brugada-like symptoms. However, loss-of-function Brugada mutations in the Cav1.2 channel cause defective trafficking of this channel, reducing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-current density in the heart.

The Cav1.4 L-type channel is highly expressed in the retina and is genetically linked to visual disorders. One form of X-linked
congenital stationary night blindness is due to mutations in the CACANA1F gene that result in nonfunctional Cav1.4 channels. The consequence is reduced sustained transmitter release by photoreceptor cells in the dark (see Fig. 15-11).

Amino-acid variations in the human CACNA1H gene for the Cav3.2 T-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel are associated with various forms of epilepsy. These symptoms appear to reflect a gain of function that enhances $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current. Genetic syndromes linked to defects in Cav3.2 include a variety of idiopathic generalized epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures.

The P/Q-type Cav2.1 channel, expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells, is the culprit in diverse CNS movement disorders (ataxia) and migraine syndromes. Mutations in the CACNA1A gene for Cav2.1 variously cause episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and familial hemiplegic migraine. Symptoms of EA2 result from Cav2.1 mutations that decrease $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current, whereas the other two disorders stem from mutations that increase $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. Discovery of the genetic origin of such diseases has led to the realization that delicate perturbations of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel activity can have profound consequences on proper function of the human nervous system.

## A 1,4-DIHYDROPYRIDINES

![bo1974543376c](bo1974543376c.jpg)

Figure 7-17 Antagonists and agonists of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. A, 1,4-Dihydropyridines. One DHP, nitrendipine, is an antagonist; another, Bay K8644, is an agonist. B, Phenylalkylamines. Verapamil is an antagonist. C, Benzothiazepines. Diltiazem is an antagonist.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers are an important group of therapeutic agents. Figure 7-17 shows the structures of representatives of three different classes of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel blockers: 1,4 dihydropyridines (DHPs), phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines. These synthetic compounds are available for treatment of cardiovascular disorders such as angina pectoris (see Box 24-1), hypertension, and various arrhythmias and also have potential applications in the treatment of CNS conditions such as cerebral vasospasm and epileptic seizure.

DHPs such as nitrendipine selectively block L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Phenylalkylamines (e.g., verapamil) and
benzothiazepines (e.g., diltiazem) also inhibit L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels; however, these other two classes of drugs act at sites that are distinct from the site that binds DHPs. Particular DHP derivatives, such as Bay K8644, actually enhance rather than inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel currents. DHPs can have the contrasting effects of either inhibitors (antagonists) or activators (agonists) because they act not by plugging the channel pore directly but by binding to a site composed of transmembrane helices S5 and S6 in domain III and S6 in domain IV. Drug binding in this region probably induces various conformational changes in channel structure and thereby perturbs $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeation and gating behavior.

Other molecules useful in discriminating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel isoforms are present in the venom of the marine snail Conus geographus and the funnel web spider Agelenopsis aperta. The snail produces a peptide called $\omega$-conotoxin GVIA, which selectively blocks N-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The spider produces the peptide $\omega$-agatoxin IVA, which selectively blocks P/Q-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. In contrast, an R-type neuronal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel is resistant to these two peptide toxins.

The summary of the basic properties of L-, T-, N-, P/Q-, and R-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels contained in Table 7-2 indicates their presumed correspondence to 10 known genes that encode $\alpha_{1}$ subunits.

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels determine resting potential and regulate the frequency and termination of action potentials

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are the largest and most diverse family of voltage-gated ion channels. Humans have at least 79 distinct genes encoding $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, characterized by a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selective S5-P-S6 pore domain (see Fig. 7-10). Ion conduction through most types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is very selective for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$according to the permeability sequence $\mathrm{K}^{+}>\mathrm{Rb}^{+}>\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \gg \mathrm{Cs}^{+}>\mathrm{Li}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Under normal physiological conditions, the permeability ratio $P_{\mathrm{K}} / P_{\mathrm{Na}}$ is $>100$, and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$can block many $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels. Some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels can pass $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$current in the complete absence of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. This characteristic is analogous to the behavior of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, which can pass $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ currents in the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

Given such strong $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity and an equilibrium potential near $\sim 80 \mathrm{mV}$, the primary role of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in excitable cells is to oppose the action of excitatory $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and stabilize the resting state. Whereas some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are major determinants of the resting potential, other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels mediate the repolarizing phase and shape of action potentials, control firing frequency, and define the bursting behavior of rhythmic firing. Such functions are broadly important in regulating the strength and frequency of all types of muscle contraction, in terminating transmitter release at nerve terminals, in attenuating the strength of synaptic connections, and in coding the intensity of sensory stimuli. Finally, in epithelia, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels also function in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ absorption and secretion.

Before understanding the molecular nature of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, electrophysiologists classified $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents according to their functional properties and gating behavior, grouping macroscopic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents into four major types:

## 1. Delayed outward rectifiers

2. Transient outward rectifiers (A-type currents)
3. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents
4. Inward rectifiers

These four fundamental $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents are the macroscopic manifestation of five distinct families of genes (see Table 6-2, family No. 2):

1. Kv channels (voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels related to the Shaker family)
2. Small- and intermediate-conductance $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels), including $\mathrm{SK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $\mathrm{IK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels
3. Large-conductance $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels ( $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels and related $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$- and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$- activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels)
4. Kir channels (inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels)
5. K2P channels (two-pore $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels)

In the next three sections, we discuss the various families of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and their associated macroscopic currents.

## The Kv (or Shaker-related) family of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels mediates both the delayed outward-rectifier current and the transient A-type current

The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current in the HH voltage-clamp analysis of the squid giant axon (see pp. 177-178) is an example of a delayed outward rectifier. Figure 7-18A shows that this current activates with a sigmoidal lag phase (i.e., it is delayed in time, as in Fig. 7-6C). Figure 7-18B is an $I-V$ plot of peak currents obtained in experiments such as that presented in Figure 7-18A and shows that the outward current rises steeply at positive voltages (i.e., it is an outward rectifier).

A second variety of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current that is also outwardly rectifying is the transient A-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current. This current was first characterized in mollusk neurons, but similar currents are common in the vertebrate nervous system. A-type currents are activated and inactivated over a relatively rapid time scale. Because their voltage activation range is typically more negative than that of other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents, they are activated in the negative $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ range that prevails during the afterhyperpolarizing phase of action potentials. In neurons that spike repetitively, this A-type current can be very important in determining the interval between successive spikes and thus the timing of repetitive action potentials. For example, if the A-type current is small, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ rises relatively quickly toward the threshold, and consequently the interspike interval is short and the firing frequency is high (see Fig. 7-18C). However, if the A-type current is large, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ rises slowly toward the threshold, and therefore the interspike interval is long and the firing frequency is low (see Fig. 7-18D). Because the nervous system often encodes sensory information as a frequency-modulated signal, these A-type currents play a critical role.

The channels responsible for both the delayed outwardrectifier and the transient A-type currents belong to the Kv channel family (where $v$ stands for voltage-gated). The prototypic protein subunit of these channels is the Shaker channel of Drosophila (see Fig. 7-12C). All channels belonging to this family contain the conserved S1 to S6 core that is characteristic of the Shaker channel (see Fig. 7-10), but may differ extensively in the length and sequence of their intracellular N-terminal and C-terminal domains. The voltagesensing element in the S4 segment underlies activation by depolarization; the S4 segment actually moves outward across the membrane with depolarizing voltage, thus increasing the probability of the channel's being open. 97-13

The Kv channel family has multiple subclasses (see Table 6-2, family No. 2). Individual members of this Kv channel family, whether in Drosophila or humans, exhibit profound differences in gating kinetics that are analogous to delayedrectifier (slow activation) or A-type (rapid inactivation) currents. For example, Figure 7-18E shows the macroscopic currents of four subtypes of rat brain Kv1 (or Shaker) channels heterologously expressed in frog oocytes. All of these Kv1 channel subtypes (Kv1.1 to Kv1.4) exhibit sigmoidal activation kinetics when examined on a brief time scale-

# BOX 7-3 Congenital and Drug-Induced Cardiac Arrhythmias Linked to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Channels 

## Congenital Long QT Syndromes

As discussed in Box 7-1, congenital cardiac abnormality in some people results in lengthening of the QT interval of the electrocardiographic signal—long QT syndrome-which corresponds to a prolonged cardiac action potential. Affected children and young adults can exhibit an arrhythmic disturbance of the ventricular heartbeat that results in sudden death. As we have already seen in Box 7-1, one form of a long QT syndrome-LQT3-involves gain-of-function mutations of the cardiac $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel Nav1.5 (SCN5A) that prolong $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel opening. However, at least six forms of long QT syndrome-LQT1, LQT2, LQT5, LQT6, LQT7, and LQT13-are caused by loss-of-function mutations in cardiac $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Table 6-2, family No. 2) or their accessory proteins.

LQT1 is due to mutations in the KCNQ1 gene encoding KvLQT1, a 581-residue protein belonging to the Kv family of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Another form of this disease, LQT2, involves mutations in the KCNH2 gene encoding HERG (for human ether-à-go-go) which is related to the gene defective in the ether-à-go-go Drosophila mutation, in which flies convulsively shake under ether anesthesia. Both KvLQT1 and HERG K* channels participate in repolarization of the human cardiac action potential (see p. 488). KvLQT1 mediates the slowly activating delayed-rectifier component $\left(I_{\mathrm{Kr}}\right)$ of cardiac action potential repolarization; HERG mediates the rapidly activating repolarization component $\left(I_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$. Both LQT1 and LQT2 result from loss-offunction effects associated with decreased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel expression in cardiac myocytes.

KvLQT1 associates with minK, a small, single-span membrane protein encoded by the KCNE1 gene. minK modulates the gating kinetics of KvLQT1, and mutations in minK cause LQT5. Three other human proteins closely related to minK are known as MiRP1, MiRP2, and MiRP3 (minK-related proteins)—the products of the genes KCNE2, KCNE3, and KCNE4, respectively. MiRP1 associates with HERG, and mutations in MiRP1 are linked to LQT6.

Two other $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel genes also cause long QT syndromes. Mutations in Kir2.1, encoded by the gene KCNJ2, cause LQT7, whereas mutations in GIRK4, encoded by KCNJ5, cause LQT13.

## Acquired Long QT Syndrome

The HERG channel is notorious for its sensitivity to blockade by many classes of therapeutic drugs, including antihistamines (e.g., terfenadine), antipsychotics (e.g., sertindole), and gastrointestinal drugs (e.g., cisapride). Blockade of HERG can readily mimic the genetic condition of LQT2. The promiscuous drug sensitivity of the HERG $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel appears to result from particular structural features of the internal aspect of the channel pore that favor binding of many hydrophobic small molecules. People who have natural variations in ion channel genes that cause a subclinical propensity for long QT intervals or who have deficiencies in drugmetabolizing enzymes appear to be especially at risk. Many drugs have been banned or limited for therapeutic use because of the risk of HERG channel block. Today all new drugs proposed for clinical use must first undergo screening for HERG blockade in order to prevent deaths by acquired long QT syndrome.
in the millisecond range (left side of Fig. 7-18E). That is, these channels display some degree of "delayed" activation. Different Kv channels exhibit different rates of activation. Thus, these currents can modulate action potential duration by either keeping it short (e.g., in nerve and skeletal muscle) when the delayed rectifier turns on quickly or keeping it long (e.g., in heart) when the delayed rectifier turns on slowly.

Kv1 channels also differ markedly in their inactivation kinetics when observed over a long time scale-in the range of seconds (right side of Fig. 7-18E). Kv1.1 exhibits little time-dependent inactivation (i.e., the current is sustained throughout the stimulus). On the other hand, the Kv1.4
channel completely inactivates in $<1$ second. Kv1.2 and Kv1.3 show intermediate behavior.

How are Kv channels inactivated? The structural basis for one particular type of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel inactivation, known as N type inactivation, is a stretch of $\sim 20$ amino-acid residues at the N terminus of some fast-inactivating Kv channels. This domain acts like a ball to block or to plug the internal mouth of the channel after it opens; the result is inactivation (see Fig. 7-18F). Thus, this process is also known as the ball-andchain mechanism of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel inactivation. Particular kinds of $\beta$ subunits that are physically associated with some isoforms of Kv channels have structural elements that mimic

Figure 7-18 Outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. A, Note that in a voltage-clamp experiment, a depolarizing step in $V_{0}$, activates the current, but with a delay. B, The current-voltage relationship is shown for a delayed outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, as in A. C, This A-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current is active at relatively negative values of $V_{0}$, and tends to hyperpolarize the cell. In a spontaneously spiking neuron, a low level of the A-type current allows $V_{0}$, to rise relatively quickly toward the threshold, which produces a relatively short interspike interval and thus a high firing rate. D, In a spontaneously spiking neuron, a high level of the A-type current causes $V_{0}$, to rise relatively slowly toward the threshold, which produces a relatively long interspike interval and thus a low firing rate. E, Four different types of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (Kv1.1, Kv1.2, Kv1.3, and Kv1.4) from mammalian brain and expressed in Xenopus oocytes show activation and inactivation kinetics during steps of $V_{0}$ from $\sim 80 \mathrm{mV}$ to $0 \mathrm{mV}$. The left panels, at high time resolution, show that some of these channels activate more slowly than others. The right panels, at a longer time scale, show that inactivation gradually speeds up from Kv1.1 to Kv1.4. F, The left panel shows N-type inactivation, so called because the N or amino terminus of the protein is essential for inactivation. Each of the four subunits is thought to have an N -terminal "ball" tethered by a "chain" that can swing into place to block the pore. The right panel shows a variant in which certain $\beta$ subunits can provide the ball and chain for Kv channel $\alpha$ subunits that themselves lack this capability at their N termini. (Data from Stühmer W, Ruppersberg JP, Schroter KH, et al: Molecular basis of functional diversity of voltage-gated potassium channels in mammalian brain. EMBO J 8:3235-3244, 1989.)

this N -terminal ball domain and rapidly inactivate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel $\alpha$ subunits that lack their own inactivation ball domain (see Fig. 7-11). Many $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels also exhibit a second, slower C-type inactivation, which appears to involve a constriction of the outer mouth of the pore.

Various delayed-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are blocked by either internal or external application of quaternary ammonium ions such as TEA (see Fig. 7-5C). Many transient A-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents are inhibited by another organic cation, 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), which effectively shifts the action potential threshold in the negative direction and also prolongs action potentials by inhibiting repolarization. Both effects promote the propagation of action potentials through demyelinated regions of axons, which is why 4-AP has been approved for treatment of symptoms of multiple sclerosis (see Box 12-1). Two distinct families of peptide toxinscharybdotoxins of scorpion venom and dendrotoxins of mamba snake venom-discriminate particular subtypes of Kv and $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, depending on the particular amino acids present in the P region. Such toxins cause nerve and muscle hyperexcitability, resulting in paralysis of envenomated victims.

## Two families of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{C}}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$channels mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels- $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels-are present in the plasma membrane of cells in many different tissues. A particular type of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel is shown in Fig. 7-19A; this is called $\mathbf{B K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ (for "big" $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ ) or the maxi- $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel because it has a large unitary conductance ( $\sim 300 \mathrm{pS}$ ). In patch-clamp experiments, all $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are easily recognized because the open probability of individual channels increases with increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ on the intracellular surface of the membrane patch (see Fig. 7-19B for $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ ). In addition, the $P_{\mathrm{a}}$ of $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ increases with positive voltage (see Fig. 7-19C). (C) N7-15 Figure 7-19D shows how increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ causes a negative or leftward shift in the $P_{\mathrm{a}}$ versus $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ plot for $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels. Thus, at negative voltages, the binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to the regulator of conductance of $\mathrm{K}^{+}(\mathrm{RCK})$ domains causes $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels to be open when they otherwise would be closed.

In principle, $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels provide a stabilizing mechanism to counteract repetitive excitation and intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ loading. $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels mediate the afterhyperpolarizing phase of action potentials (see Fig. 7-1A) in cell bodies of various neurons. They have also been implicated in terminating bursts of action potentials in bursting neuronal pacemaker cells. Thus, the gradual increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ that occurs during repetitive firing triggers the opening of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, which results in hyperpolarization and a quiescent interburst period that lasts until intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ accumulation is reversed by the action of Ca pumps (see p. 118). $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are also present at high density in many types of smoothmuscle cells, where they appear to contribute to the relaxation of tension by providing a hyperpolarizing counterbalance to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent contraction. In a number of nonexcitable cells, $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are activated during cell swelling and contribute to regulatory volume decrease (see pp. 131-132).

In addition to the $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel and the related $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$- and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, there is another $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel gene family that includes small- and intermediate-conductance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, respectively termed $\mathrm{SK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $\mathrm{IK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ (see Table 6-2, family No. 2). Unlike $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, the closely related $\mathrm{IK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $\mathrm{SK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are voltage insensitive and are activated by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein calmodulin (see p. 60). In some cells, $\mathrm{SK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ and $\mathrm{IK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels participate in action potential repolarization and afterhyperpolarization, thus regulating action potential firing frequency. $\mathrm{IK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ also functions in the activation of lymphocytes.

## The Kir $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels mediate inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ currents, and K2P channels may sense stress

In contrast to the delayed rectifiers and A-type currentswhich are outwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents-the inwardrectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current (also known as the anomalous rectifier) actually conducts more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current in the inward direction than in the outward direction. Such inwardly rectifying, steady-state $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents have been recorded in many types of cells, including heart, skeletal muscle, and epithelia. Physiologically, these channels help clamp the resting membrane potential close to the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$equilibrium potential and prevent excessive loss of intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$during repetitive activity and long-duration action potentials. In epithelial cells, these inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents are important because they stabilize $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in the face of electrogenic ion transporters that tend to depolarize the cell (see Chapter 5).

The channel-forming subunits of the inward-rectifier (Kir) $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel family are relatively small proteins ( $\sim 400$ to 500 residues) that do not contain the complete S1 to S6 core domain found in the Kv and $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel families. However, the Kir channels do have a conserved pore domain similar to the S5-P-S6 segment of Kv channels (Fig. 7-20A). (C) N7-13 The conserved P region is the most basic structural element that is common to all $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The absence of an S1 to S4 voltage-sensing domain in Kir channels is consistent with their lack of steeply voltage-dependent activation.

Figure 7-20B shows a series of single channel currents from a particular type of Kir channel, with equal concentrations of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$on both sides of the membrane and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ on the cytosolic side. Under these conditions, the channel conducts $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current only in the inward direction. An $I-V$ plot derived from such data (see Fig. 7-20C) shows typical inward rectification of the unitary current. At negative values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$, the inward current decreases linearly as voltage becomes more positive, and no outward current is present at positive values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. However, when $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is omitted from the cytosolic side of the membrane, the channel exhibits a linear or ohmic $\boldsymbol{I}$-V curve even over the positive range of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values. Thus, the inward rectification in this example is due to intracellular block of the channel by $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Selective inhibition of outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current in the presence of intracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ results from voltage-dependent binding of this divalent metal ion. Positive internal voltage favors the binding of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ to the inner mouth of this channel (see Fig. 7-20D), as would be expected if the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ binding site is located within the transmembrane electrical field. Because $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ cannot permeate the channel, it acts as a blocker of outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current. However, negative values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ pull the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ out of the channel. Moreover, incoming $\mathrm{K}^{+}$tends to displace any remaining $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Thus, the

# N7-15 The $\mathbf{B K}_{\text {Ca }}$ Channel 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel was discovered by cloning and sequencing the Slowpoke gene of Drosophila. The $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channel-forming $\alpha$ subunit-activated by intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-consists of a conserved S 1 to S 6 motif, an extra S 0 transmembrane segment at the amino terminus, and a unique C-terminal intracellular domain of -850 residues, consisting of two RCK domains. The RCK domains contain $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding sites involved in channel activation (see Table 6-2, family No. 2, as well as Fig. 7-19).

Because BK $\mathbf{C a}_{\text {a }}$ channels-like Kv channels-have a voltagesensing domain that is analogous to S 4 , they are also activated by positive voltage.

Besides the plasma membrane, $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels are also present in the inner mitochondrial membrane of cardiac myocytes, where they exert a cardioprotective role under conditions of ischemia. Hypoxia increases the open probability of this channel, which would lead to an efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the mitochondrial matrix into the cytosol; this efflux would tend to maintain a relatively high cytosolic $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$and help to maintain a relatively negative resting potential.

Kir channel favors $\mathrm{K}^{+}$influx over efflux. Under physiological conditions, intracellular cationic polyamines such as spermine and spermidine $\bigcirc$ N7-16 block outward movements through Kir channels in a fashion similar to $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and largely account for the Kir rectification. In skeletal muscle, the Kir2.1 channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 2) appears to function in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$re-uptake from the T-tubule system during prolonged periods of muscle contraction associated with a rise in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$and muscle fatigue.

The Kir family of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels exhibits various modes of regulation. One Kir subfamily (the G protein-activated inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels or GIRKs) is regulated by the $\beta \gamma$ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (see pp. 51-66). For example, stimulation of the vagus nerve slows the

Spermine and spermidine are important regulators of numerous processes associated with cell growth. These polyamines modulate the activity of many cation channels in addition to having the blocking effect on Kir channels described here.

A, This family of channels has only two membrane-spanning segments that correspond to the S5-P-S6 domain of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. B, The GIRK1 channelsa particular type of Kir channel-were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied by use of a patch pipette in the inside-out configuration. $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ was clamped to values between -100 mV and +60 mV , and $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ was 2.5 mM on the cytosolic side. Note that channel activity increases at more negative voltages but the channel is virtually inactive at positive voltages. C, The $I-V$ plot shows that there is inward rectification only in the presence of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ on the cytosolic side. In the absence of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, the $I-V$ relationship is nearly linear or ohmic. D, As shown in the left panel, cytosolic $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ occludes the channel pore and prevents the exit of intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. However, even in the presence of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$can move into the cell by displacing the $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$.

heartbeat because the vagal neurotransmitter acetylcholine binds to postsynaptic muscarinic receptors in the heart that are coupled to G proteins. The binding of acetylcholine to muscarinic receptors causes the release of G-protein $\beta \gamma$ subunits, which diffuse to a site on neighboring GIRK channels to activate their opening. The resulting increase in outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current hyperpolarizes the cardiac cell, $\Theta N \theta$ thereby slowing the rate at which $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ approaches the threshold for firing action potentials and lowering the heart rate. GIRK channels are also activated by the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$. Thus, G protein-coupled receptors that activate phospholipase C lead to the release of $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$, thereby activating GIRK channels.

Another subfamily of Kir $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels known as $\mathbf{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels are directly regulated by adenine nucleotides. $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels are present in the plasma membrane of many cell
types, including skeletal muscle, heart, neurons, insulinsecreting $\beta$ cell of the pancreas, and renal tubule. These channels are inhibited by intracellular ATP and activated by ADP in a complex fashion. They are believed to provide a direct link between cellular metabolism, on the one hand, and membrane excitability and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport, on the other. For example, if cellular ATP levels fall because of oxygen deprivation, opening of such channels hyperpolarizes the cell to suppress $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and firing of action potentials, and further reduce energy expenditure. Pancreatic $\beta$ cells respond to an increase in plasma [glucose] by elevating their uptake of glucose and, thus, glucose metabolism and the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio. This increased ratio inhibits enough $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels to cause a small depolarization, which in turn activates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, resulting in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dependent insulin secretion (see pp. 1039-1041).

# N7-17 Hyperpolarization by Activation of GIRKs 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Even though Kir channels pass current better in the inward than outward direction, the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ is typically never more negative than $E_{k}$. Thus, net inward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current does not occur physiologically. As a result, the activation of GIRK channels hyperpolarizes cardiac cells by increasing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance or outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current.

$\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels are the target of a group of antidiabetic drugs called sulfonylureas that include tolbutamide and glibenclamide. Sulfonylureas are used in the treatment of type 2 (or non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus because they inhibit pancreatic $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels and stimulate insulin release. Another chemically diverse group of drugs (e.g., pinacidil and cromakalim) called $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel openers activate $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ and $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels. Such $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel openers may have therapeutic potential in light of their ability to relax various types of smooth muscle. The ability of sulfonylurea drugs to inhibit $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels depends on an accessory subunit called the sulfonylurea receptor (SUR). This protein is a member of the ATP-binding cassette family of proteins (see pp. 119-120), which include two nucleotide-binding domains.

The most recently discovered family of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is that of the two-pore or K2P channels, which consist of a tandem repeat of the basic Kir topology (see Fig. 6-20F). Because the monomeric subunit of K2P channels contains two linked S5-P-S6 pore domains, a dimer of the monomer contains four S5-P-S6 pores and thereby forms a functional channel. K2P channels have been implicated in the genesis of the resting membrane potential. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels encoded by the 15 human genes for K2P channels may be activated by various chemical and physical signals including $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$, membrane stretch, heat, high intracellular pH , and general anesthetics. These channels are thought to be involved in a wide range of sensory and neuronal functions.

## PROPAGATION OF ACTION POTENTIALS

## The propagation of electrical signals in the nervous system involves local current loops

The extraordinary functional diversity of ion channel proteins provides a large array of mechanisms by which the membrane potential of a cell can be changed to evoke an electrical signal or biochemical response. However, channels alone do not control the spread of electrical current. Like electricity in a copper wire, the passive spread of current in biological tissue depends on the nature of the conducting and insulating medium. Important factors include geometry (i.e., cell shape and tissue anatomy), electrical resistance of the aqueous solutions and cell membrane, and membrane capacitance. Furthermore, the electrotonic spread of electrical signals is not limited to excitable cells.

Efficient propagation of a change in $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ is essential for the local integration of electrical signals at the level of a single cell and for the global transmission of signals across large distances in the body. As we discussed above in this chapter (see Fig. 7-2), action potentials propagate in a regenerative manner without loss of amplitude as long as the depolarization spreads to an adjacent region of excitable membrane and does so with sufficient strength to depolarize the membrane above its threshold. However, many types of nonregenerative, subthreshold potentials also occur and spread for short distances along cell membranes. These graded responses, which we also discussed above, contrast with the all-or-nothing nature of action potentials. Such nonregenerative signals include receptor potentials generated during the transduction of sensory stimuli and synaptic
potentials generated by the opening of agonist-activated channels.

With a graded response, the greater the stimulus, the greater the voltage change. For example, the greater the intensity of light that is shined on a mammalian photoreceptor cell in the retina, the greater the hyperpolarization produced by the cell. Similarly, the greater the concentration of acetylcholine applied at a postsynaptic neuromuscular junction, the greater the resulting depolarization (i.e., synaptic potential). Just as subthreshold voltage responses produced by current injections into a cell through a microelectrode decline by passive electrotonic spread, graded signals dissipate over distances of a few millimeters and thus have only local effects. In contrast, action potentials-actively generated by above-threshold depolarization-can propagate over a meter via nerve axons.

Electrotonic spread of voltage changes along the cell occurs by the flow of electrical current that is carried by ions in the intracellular and extracellular medium along pathways of the least electrical resistance. Both depolarizations and hyperpolarizations of a small area of membrane produce local circuit currents. Figure 7-21A illustrates how the transient voltage change that occurs during an action potential at a particular active site results in local current flow. The cytosol of the active region, where the membrane is depolarized, has a slight excess of positive charge compared with the adjacent inactive regions of the cytosol, which have a slight excess of negative charge. (○) N7-18 This charge imbalance within the cytosol causes currents of ions to flow from the electrically excited region to adjacent regions of the cytoplasm. Because current always flows in a complete circuit along pathways of least resistance, the current spreads longitudinally from positive to negative regions along the cytoplasm, moves outward across membrane conductance pathways ("leak channels"), and flows along the extracellular medium back to the site of origin, thereby closing the current loop. Because of this flow of current (i.e., positive charge), the region of membrane immediately adjacent to the active region becomes more depolarized, and $V_{\mathrm{oc}}$ eventually reaches threshold. Thus, an action potential is generated in this adjacent region as well. Nerve and muscle fibers conduct impulses in both directions if an inactive fiber is excited at a central location, as in this example. However, if an action potential is initiated at one end of a nerve fiber, it will travel only to the opposite end and stop because the refractory period prevents backward movement of the impulse (see p. 302). Likewise, currents generated by subthreshold responses migrate equally in both directions.

## Myelin improves the efficiency with which axons conduct action potentials

The flow of electrical current along a cylindrical nerve axon has often been compared with electrical flow through an undersea cable. Similar principles apply to both types of conducting fiber. An underwater cable is designed to carry an electrical current for long distances with little current loss; therefore, it is constructed of a highly conductive (lowresistance) metal in its core and a thick plastic insulation wrapped around the core to prevent loss of current to the surrounding seawater. In contrast, the axoplasm of a nerve

# N7-18 Charge Separation Required to Generate the Membrane Potential 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

To generate a membrane potential, there must be a tiny separation of charge across the membrane. How large is that charge? Imagine that we have a spherical cell with a diameter of $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. If $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ is 100 mM and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{m}}$ is 10 mM , the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ according to the Nernst equation would be -61.5 mV (or -0.0615 V ) for a perfectly $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-selective membrane at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. What is the charge $(Q)$ on $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ of the "plates" of the membrane capacitor? We assume that the specific capacitance is $1 \mu \mathrm{~F} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$. From Equation 6-13 in the text, we know that

$$
Q=C V
$$

where $Q$ is measured in coulombs (C), $C$ is in farads ( $F$ ), and $V$ is in volts (V). Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
Q & =\left(1 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~F} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right) \times(0.0615 \mathrm{~V}) \\
& =61.5 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The Faraday is the charge of 1 mole of univalent ions-or $96,480 \mathrm{C} \bigcirc$ N6-12. To determine how many moles of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$we need to separate in order to achieve an electrical charge of 61.5 $\times 10^{-9} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{cm}^{-2}$ (i.e., the $Q$ in the previous equation), we merely divide $Q$ by the faraday. Because $V_{m}$ is negative, the cell needs to lose $\mathrm{K}^{+}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { The surface area for a spherical cell with a diameter of } 10 \mu \mathrm{~m} \\
& \text { is } 3.14 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~cm}^{2} \text {. Therefore, }
\end{aligned}
$$

Total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$deficit per cell $=\frac{6.37 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles }}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}} \times \frac{3.14 \times 10^{-6} \mathrm{~cm}^{2}}{1}$

$$
=2.0 \times 10^{-18} \text { moles }
$$

(NE 7-14)
The volume of this cell is $0.52 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~L}$. Given a $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$ of 100 mM ,

Total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content of cell $=(0.1 \mathrm{~mole} / \mathrm{L}) \times\left(0.52 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{~L}\right)$

$$
=0.52 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles }
$$

(NE 7-15)
What fraction of the cell's total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content represents the charge separated by the membrane?

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Fraction of cell } \mathrm{K}^{+}=\frac{\mathrm{K}^{+} \text {deficit of cell }}{\text { Total } \mathrm{K}^{+} \text {content of cell }} \\
& =\frac{2.0 \times 10^{-18} \text { moles }}{0.52 \times 10^{-13} \text { moles }} \\
& =4 \times 10^{-5} \text { or } 0.004 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, in the process of generating a $V_{m}$ of -61.5 mV , our hypothetical cell needs to lose only $0.004 \%$ of its total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content to charge the capacitance of the cell membrane.

Figure 7-21 Local current loops during action potential propagation. A, In an unmyelinated axon, the ionic currents flow at one instant in time as a result of the action potential ("active" zone). In the "inactive" zones that are adjacent to the active zone, the outward currents lead to a depolarization. If the membrane is not in an absolute refractory period and if the depolarization is large enough to reach threshold, the immediately adjacent inactive zones will become active and fire their own action potential. In the more distant inactive zones, the outward current is not intense enough to cause $V_{0}$ to reach threshold. Thus, the magnitudes of the outward currents decrease smoothly with increasing distance from the active zone. B, In this example, the "active" zone consists of a single node of Ranvier. As an action potential conducts along a myelinated axon, the ionic current flows only through the nodes, which lack myelin and have a very high density of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels. Ionic current does not flow through the internodal membrane because of the high resistance of myelin. Rather, as an action potential fires at a node, the resistance-capacitance properties of the adjacent internodal membrane (see Fig. 6-11) give rise to charge displacement across this internodal membrane-that is, a capacitative current-that actually is responsible for conducting the action potential through the internodal region. As a result, the current flowing down the axon is conserved, and the current density at the nodes is very high, triggering an action potential at the next node. Thus, the regenerative action potential propagates in a "saltatory" manner by jumping from node to node.
fiber has much higher resistance than a copper wire, and the nerve membrane is inherently electrically leaky because of background channel conductance. Therefore, in a biological fiber such as a nerve or muscle cell, some current is passively lost into the surrounding medium, and the amplitude of the signal rapidly dissipates over a short distance.

Animal nervous systems use two basic strategies to improve the conduction properties of nerve fibers: (1) increasing the diameter of the axon, thus decreasing the internal resistance of the cable; and (2) myelinating the fibers, which increases the electrical insulation around the cable. As axon diameter increases, the conduction velocity of action potentials increases because the internal resistance of the axoplasm is inversely related to the internal crosssectional area of the axon. Unmyelinated nerve fibers of the invertebrate squid giant axon (as large as $\sim 1000 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter) are a good example of this type of size adaptation. These nerve axons mediate the escape response of the squid from its predators and can propagate action potentials at a velocity of $\sim 25 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.

In vertebrates, myelination of smaller-diameter ( $\sim 1-$ to $5-\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) nerve axons serves to improve the efficiency of impulse propagation, especially over the long distances that
nerves traverse between the brain and the extremities. Axons are literally embedded in myelin, which consists of concentrically wound wrappings of the membranes of certain glial cells (see pp. 292-293). The thickness of the myelin sheath may amount to $20 \%$ to $40 \%$ of the diameter of a nerve fiber, and the sheath may consist of as many as 300 membrane layers. The glial cells that produce myelin are called Schwann cells in the periphery and oligodendrocytes in the brain. Because resistors in series add directly and capacitors in series add as the sum of the reciprocal, the insulating resistance of a myelinated fiber with 300 membrane layers is increased by a factor of 300 and the capacitance is decreased to $1 / 300$ that of a single membrane. This large increase in membrane resistance minimizes loss of current across the leaky axonal membrane and forces the current to flow longitudinally along the inside of the fiber.

In myelinated peripheral nerves, the myelin sheath is interrupted at regular intervals, forming short $(\sim 1-\mu \mathrm{m})$ uncovered regions called nodes of Ranvier. The length of the myelinated axon segments between adjacent unmyelinated nodes ranges from 0.2 to 2 mm . In mammalian axons, the density of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels is very high at the nodal membrane, whereas $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are localized

Figure 7-22 Passive cable properties of an axon. A, The axon is represented as a hollow, cylindrical "cable" that is filled with an electrolyte solution. All of the electrical properties of the axon are represented by discrete elements that are expressed in terms of the length of the axon. $\varepsilon$ is the resistance of the internal medium. Similarly, $r_{0}$ is the resistance of the external medium. $r_{e}$, and $c_{0}$, are the membrane resistance and capacitance per discrete element of axon length. B, When current is injected into the axon, the current flows away from the injection site in both directions. The current density smoothly decays with increasing distance from the site of injection. C, Because the current density decreases with distance from the site of current injection in $\mathbf{B}$, the electrotonic potential (V) also decays exponentially with distance in both directions. $V_{0}$ is the maximum change in $V_{0}$, that is at the site of current injection.
in the paranodal regions flanking each node. The unique anatomy of myelinated axons results in a mode of impulse propagation known as saltatory conduction. Current flow that is initiated at an excited node flows directly to adjacent nodes with little loss of transmembrane current through the internode region (see Fig. 7-21B). In other words, the high membrane resistance in the internode region effectively forces the current to travel from node to node.

The high efficiency of impulse conduction in such axons allows several adjacent nodes in the same fiber to fire an action potential virtually simultaneously as it propagates. Thus, saltatory conduction in a myelinated nerve can reach a very high velocity, up to $130 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The action potential velocity in a myelinated nerve fiber can thus be several-fold greater than that in a giant unmyelinated axon, even though the axon diameter in the myelinated fiber may be more than two orders of magnitude smaller. During conduction of an action potential in a myelinated axon, the intracellular regions between nodes also transiently depolarize as a result of capacitative current. However, no transmembrane current flows in these internodal regions, and therefore no dissipation of ion gradients occurs. The nodal localization of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels conserves ionic concentration gradients that must be maintained at the expense of ATP hydrolysis by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump.

## The cable properties of the membrane and cytoplasm determine the velocity of signal propagation

Using the analogy of a nerve fiber as an underwater cable, cable theory allows one to model the pathways of electrical current flow along biomembranes. The approach is to use circuit diagrams that were first employed to describe the properties of electrical cables. Figure 7-22A illustrates the equivalent circuit diagram of a cylindrical electrical cable or membrane that is filled and bathed in a conductive

electrolyte solution. The membrane itself is represented by discrete elements, each with a transverse membrane resistance $\left(r_{m}\right)$ and capacitance $\left(c_{m}\right)$ connected in parallel (a representation we used above, in Fig. 6-11A). Consecutive membrane elements are connected in series by discrete resistors, each of which represents the electrical resistance of a finite length of the external medium $\left(r_{e}\right)$ or internal medium $\left(r_{i}\right)$. The parameters $r_{m}, c_{m}, r_{e}$, and $r_{i}$ refer to a unit length of axon (Table 7-3).

How do the various electrical components of the cable model influence the electrotonic spread of current along an axon? To answer this question, we inject a steady electrical current into an axon with a microelectrode to produce a constant voltage $\left(V_{0}\right)$ at a particular point $(x=0)$ along the length of the axon (see Fig. 7-22B). This injection of current results in the longitudinal spread of current in both directions from point $x=0$. The voltage $(V)$ at various points along the axon decays exponentially with distance $(x)$ from the point of current injection (see Fig. 7-22C), according to the following equation:

$$
V=V_{0} e^{-x / \lambda}
$$

The parameter $\lambda$ has units of distance and is referred to as the length constant or the space constant. One length constant away from the point of current injection, $V$ is $1 / e$, or $\sim 37 \%$ of the maximum value of $V_{0}$. The decaying currents that spread away from the location of a current-passing electrode are called electrotonic currents. Similarly, the passive spread of subthreshold voltage changes away from a site of origin is referred to as electrotonic spread, unlike the regenerative propagation of action potentials.

The length constant depends on the three resistance elements in Figure 7-22A: (5) N7-19

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{r_{m}}{r_{n}+r_{i}}}
$$

We can simplify this expression by noting that internal resistance is much larger than external resistance, so the contribution of $r_{n}$ to the denominator can be ignored. Thus,

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{r_{m}}{r_{i}}}
$$

The significance of the length constant is that it determines how far the electrotonic spread of a local change in membrane potential can extend to influence neighboring regions of membrane. The longer the length constant, the farther down the axon a voltage change spreads.

How does the diameter of an axon affect the length constant? To answer this question, we must replace $r_{m}$ and $r_{i}$ (expressed in terms of axon length) in Equation 7-7 with the specific resistances $R_{m}$ and $R_{i}$ (expressed in terms of the area of axon membrane or cross-sectional area of axoplasm). Making the substitutions according to the definitions in Table 7-3, we have (5) N7-20

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{a R_{m}}{2 R_{i}}}
$$

Thus, the length constant $(\lambda)$ is directly proportional to the square root of the axon radius (a). Equation 7-8 confirms basic intuitive notions about what makes an efficiently conducting electrical cable:

1. The greater the specific membrane resistance $\left(R_{m}\right)$ and cable radius, the greater the length constant and the less the loss of signal.
2. The greater the resistance of the internal conductor $\left(R_{i}\right)$, the smaller the length constant and the greater the loss of signal.
These relationships also confirm measurements of length constants in different biological preparations. For example, the length constant of a squid axon with a diameter of $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm}$ is $\sim 13 \mathrm{~mm}$, whereas that of a mammalian nerve fiber with a diameter of $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ is $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm}$.

So far, we have been discussing the spatial spread of voltage changes that are stable in time. In other words, we assumed that the amount of injected current was steady. What happens if the current is not steady? For example, what happens at the beginning of a stimulus when we (or a physiological receptor) first turn the current "on"? To answer these questions, we need to know how rapidly $V_{m}$ changes in time at a particular site, which is described by a second cable parameter called the membrane time constant $\left(\tau_{m}\right)$. Rather than determining the spread of voltage changes in space, as the length constant does, the time constant influences the spread of voltage changes in time and thus the velocity of signal propagation. We previously discussed the time constant with respect to the time course of the change in $V_{m}$ caused by a stepwise pulse of current (see Fig. 6-12A). Because the membrane behaves like an RC circuit, the voltage response to a square current pulse across a small piece of membrane follows an exponential time course with a time constant that is equal to the product of membrane resistance and capacitance:

$$
\tau_{\mathrm{m}}=R_{\mathrm{m}} \cdot C_{\mathrm{m}}
$$

# N7-19 Resistance and Capacitance Units for Cable Properties 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The purpose of this webnote is to justify the units given in the first four rows of Table 7-3. Our approach is to present these four electrical units per unit length of axon and then to show how these units make sense when we calculate the resistance or capacitance of an entire axon.

The longitudinal resistances of the intracellular fluid $\left(r_{i}\right)$ and extracellular fluids $\left(r_{i}\right)$ are expressed in units of ohms per centimeter. In each case, we can think of the total resistance of either the intra- or extracellular fluid as being the resistance of a stack of resistors in series-each resistor representing 1 cm of fluid length along the axis of the cable. Thus, the total resistance of either the intra- or extracellular fluid (in ohms) increases in proportion to increasing fiber length (in centimeters), and the proportionality factor is the longitudinal resistance of each of the $N$ segments (in ohms per centimeter):

Total resistance $=(\text { Individual resistance }) \times N$
Because each $N$ is in fact 1 cm ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Total resistance } & =\frac{\text { ohm }}{\mathrm{cm}} \times \mathrm{cm} \\
& =\text { ohm }
\end{aligned}
$$

The transverse membrane resistance $\left(r_{m}\right)$ is expressed in the units ohms $\times$ centimeters. We can think of the total resistance of the membrane as being the resistance of a stack of resistors in parallel-each resistor representing the membrane resistance of a segment of axon that is 1 cm long. Because the $N$ resistors are arranged in parallel,

$$
\frac{1}{\text { Total resistance }}=\sum_{n=1}^{N} \frac{1}{\text { Individual resistance }}
$$

Rearranging,

$$
\text { Total resistance }=\frac{\text { Individual resistance }}{N} \quad \text { (NE 7-18) }
$$

Finally, inserting the units for the individual resistance, and realizing that each $N$ is in fact 1 cm , we obtain

$$
\text { Total resistance }=\frac{\text { ohm } \times \mathrm{cm}}{\mathrm{~cm}}=\text { ohm } \quad \text { (NE 7-19) }
$$

One way to think of this is that a longer section of axon membrane has more channels, a greater total conductance, and thus a lower total resistance.

The membrane capacitance $\left(c_{m}\right)$ has the units microfarads per centimeter. We can think of the total capacitance of the membrane as being the capacitance of a stack of capacitors in parallel-each capacitor representing the membrane capacitance of a segment of axon that is 1 cm long. Because the $N$ capacitors are arranged in parallel,

Total capacitance $=(\text { Individual capacitance }) \times N$
Because each $N$ is in fact 1 cm ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Total capacitance } & =\left(\frac{\text { farad }}{\mathrm{cm}}\right) \times \mathrm{cm} \\
& =\text { farad }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, just as longitudinal resistances in series summate, membrane capacitances in parallel summate; both are thus expressed per unit length.

## N7-20 Units of the "Length Constant"

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In our discussion of cable properties in the text, we presented Table 7-3, which summarizes the units of cable parameters in two ways: (1) resistance per unit length (top three rows in Table 7-3) and (2) specific resistance (fifth and sixth rows in Table 7-3).

## Resistance per Unit Length

In the text, we presented Equation 7-6 (shown here as Equation NE 7-21):

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{m}}{\varepsilon_{0}+r_{i}}}
$$

The above equation uses resistance per unit length. If we substitute the appropriate units from Table 7-3 into the above equation, we obtain

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{\varepsilon_{m}}{\varepsilon_{0}+r_{i}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\text { ohm } \times \mathrm{cm}}{\text { ohm } / \mathrm{cm}}}=\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}=\mathrm{cm}
$$

Thus, the length constant has units of distance (centimeters).

## Specific Resistance

In the text, we presented Equation 7-8 (shown here as Equation NE 7-23):

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{a R_{m}}{2 R_{i}}}
$$

The above equation uses specific resistance. If we substitute the appropriate units from Table 7-3 into the preceding equation, we obtain

$$
\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{(c m) \times(\text { ohm } \times \mathrm{cm}^{2})}{(\text { ohm } \times \mathrm{cm})}}=\sqrt{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}=\mathrm{cm}
$$

Thus, the length constant again has units of distance (centimeters).

We introduced this expression above as Equation 6-17. The shorter the time constant, the more quickly a neighboring region of membrane will be brought to threshold and the sooner the region will fire an action potential. Thus, the shorter the time constant, the faster the speed of impulse propagation and vice versa. In contrast, conduction velocity is directly proportional to the length constant. The greater the length constant, the further a signal can spread before decaying below threshold and the greater the area of membrane that the stimulus can excite. These relationships explain why, in terms of relative conduction velocity, a highresistance, low-capacitance myelinated axon has a distinct advantage over an unmyelinated axon of the same diameter for all but the smallest axons ( $<1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter; see p. 302).

In summary, the cable parameters of length constant and time constant determine the way in which graded potentials and action potentials propagate over space and time in biological tissue. These parameters are in turn a function of material properties that include resistance, capacitance, and geometric considerations. The dependence of impulse conduction velocity on fiber diameter has been studied experimentally and analyzed theoretically for unmyelinated and myelinated nerve axons. For unmyelinated axons, conduction velocity increases roughly with the square root of the axon's diameter, just as the length constant increases with the square root of the axon's diameter or radius (see Equation 7-8). In contrast, the conduction velocity of myelinated fibers is a linear function of diameter and increases $\sim 6 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ per
$1-\mu \mathrm{m}$ increase in outer diameter. Thus, a mammalian myelinated axon with an outer diameter of $\sim 4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ has roughly the same impulse velocity as a squid giant axon with a diameter of $500 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ! However, for myelinated fibers with a very small diameter ( $<1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), the adverse effect of high internal resistance of the axoplasm predominates, and conduction is slower than in unmyelinated axons of the same outer diameter. For outer diameters that are greater than $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, the increased membrane resistance and reduced capacitance caused by myelination result in much faster conduction velocities.

The physiological importance of myelin in action potential propagation is most dramatically illustrated in the pathology that underlies human demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. This disease is an autoimmune disorder in which the myelin sheath surrounding CNS axons is progressively lost (see Box 12-1). Gradual demyelination is responsible for an array of neurological symptoms that involve various degrees of paralysis and altered or lost sensation. As myelin is eliminated, the loss of membrane resistance and increased capacitance mean that propagated action potentials may ultimately fail to reach the next node of Ranvier and thus result in nerve blockage.

# SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION AND THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION 

Edward G. Moczydlowski

The ionic gradients that cells maintain across their membranes provide a form of stored electrochemical energy that cells can use for electrical signaling. The combination of a resting membrane potential of -60 to -90 mV and a diverse array of voltage-gated ion channels allows excitable cells to generate action potentials that propagate over long distances along the surface membrane of a single nerve axon or muscle fiber. However, another class of mechanisms is necessary to transmit such electrical information from cell to cell throughout the myriad of neuronal networks that link the brain with sensory and effector organs. Electrical signals must pass across the specialized gap region between two apposing cell membranes that is called a synapse. The process underlying this cell-to-cell transfer of electrical signals is termed synaptic transmission. Communication between cells at a synapse can be either electrical or chemical. Electrical synapses provide direct electrical continuity between cells by means of gap junctions, whereas chemical synapses link two cells together by a chemical neurotransmitter that is released from one cell and diffuses to another.

In this chapter we introduce the general principles of synaptic transmission and then focus mainly on synaptic transmission between a motor neuron and a skeletal muscle fiber. This interface between the motor neuron and the muscle cell is called the neuromuscular junction. In Chapter 13, we expand upon this topic with a focus on synaptic transmission between neurons in the central nervous system (CNS).

## MECHANISMS OF SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION

## Electrical continuity between cells is established by electrical or chemical synapses

Once the concept of bioelectricity had taken hold among physiologists of the 19th century, it became clear that the question of how electrical signals flow between cells posed a fundamental biological problem. Imagine that two cells lie side by side without any specialized device for communication between them. Furthermore, imagine that a flat, $20-\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ membrane area of the first, or presynaptic, cell is separatedby 15 nm -from a similar area of the second, or postsynaptic, cell. In his classic book on electrophysiology, Bernard

Katz calculated that a voltage signal at the presynaptic membrane would suffer 10,000 -fold attenuation in the postsynaptic membrane. A similar calculation based on the geometry and cable properties of a typical nerve-muscle synapse suggests that an action potential arriving at a nerve terminal could depolarize the postsynaptic membrane by only $1 \mu \mathrm{~V}$ after crossing the synaptic gap-an attenuation of $10^{5}$. Clearly, the evolution of complex multicellular organisms required the development of special synaptic mechanisms for electrical signaling to serve as a workable means of intercellular communication.

Two competing hypotheses emerged in the 19th century to explain how closely apposed cells could communicate electrically. One school of thought proposed that cells are directly linked by microscopic connecting bridges that enable electrical signals to flow directly. Other pioneering physiologists used pharmacological observations to infer that cell-to-cell transmission was chemical in nature. Ultimate resolution of this question awaited both the development of electron microscopic techniques, which permitted visualization of the intimate contact region between cells, and further studies in neurochemistry, which identified the small organic molecules that are responsible for neurotransmission. By 1960, accumulated evidence led to the general recognition that cells use both direct electrical and indirect chemical modes of transmission to communicate with one another.

The essential structural element of intercellular communication, the synapse, is a specialized point of contact between the membranes of two different but connected cells. Electrical and chemical synapses have unique morphological features, distinguishable by electron microscopy. One major distinction is the distance of separation between the two apposing cell membranes. At electrical synapses, the adjacent cell membranes are separated by $\sim 3 \mathrm{~nm}$ and appear to be nearly sealed together by a plate-like structure that is a fraction of a micrometer in diameter. Freeze-fracture images of the intramembrane plane in this region reveal a cluster of closely packed intramembranous particles that represent a gap junction. As described, a gap junction corresponds to planar arrays of connexons, each of which is made up of six connexin monomers (see Fig. 6-18). The multiple connexons from apposing cells physically connect the two cells together via multiple aqueous channels.

In contrast to those of the gap junction, the apposing cell membranes of the chemical synapse are separated by a much larger distance of $\sim 30 \mathrm{~nm}$ at a neuronal chemical synapse and up to 50 nm at the vertebrate nerve-muscle synapse. An additional characteristic of a chemical synapse is the presence of numerous synaptic vesicles on the side of the synapse that initiates the signal transmission, termed the presynaptic side. These vesicles are sealed, spherical membrane-bound structures that range in diameter from 40 to 200 nm and contain a high concentration of chemical neurotransmitter.

The contrasting morphological characteristics of electrical and chemical synapses underline the contrasting mechanisms by which they function (Table 8-1). Electrical synapses pass voltage changes directly from one cell to another across the low-resistance continuity that is provided by the connexion channels. On the other hand, chemical synapses link two cells by the diffusion of a chemical transmitter across the large gap separating them. Key steps in chemical neurotransmission include release of transmitter from synaptic vesicles into the synaptic space, diffusion of transmitter across the cleft of the synapse, and activation of the postsynaptic cell by binding of transmitter to a specific receptor protein on the postsynaptic cell membrane.

Direct evidence for the existence of chemical synapses actually predated the experimental confirmation of electrical synapses. The foundations of synaptic physiology can be traced to early studies of the autonomic nervous system. Early in the 1900s, researchers noted that adrenal gland extracts, which contain epinephrine (or adrenaline), elicit physiological effects (e.g., increases in heart rate and blood pressure) that are similar to those elicited by stimulation of sympathetic nerve fibers. In 1904, Thomas R. Elliot proposed that sympathetic nerves might release a substance analogous to epinephrine-later identified as norepinephrinethat would function in chemical transmission between a nerve and its target organ.

Subsequent studies by Otto Loewi suggested that the vagus nerve, which is parasympathetic, produces a substance responsible for depression of the heartbeat. His classic 1921 experiment is widely cited as the first definitive evidence for chemical neurotransmission. Loewi used an ingenious bioassay to test for the release of a chemical substance by the vagus nerve. He repeatedly stimulated the vagus nerve of a cannulated frog heart and observed a slowing of the heartbeat. At the same time, he collected the artificial saline that emerged from the ventricle of this overstimulated heart. When he later applied the collected fluid from the vagusstimulated heart to a different heart, he observed that this
perfusate slowed the second heart in a manner that was identical to direct vagal stimulation. He also later identified the active compound in the perfusion fluid, originally called Vagusstoff, as acetylcholine (ACh).

Efforts by Henry Dale and coworkers to understand the basis of neurotransmission between motor nerves and skeletal muscle culminated in the identification of ACh as the endogenous excitatory neurotransmitter. Thus, the inherent complexity of chemical synaptic transmission was evident from these earliest investigations, which indicated that the same neurotransmitter (ACh) could have an inhibitory action at one synapse (vagus nerve-heart) and an excitatory action at another synapse (motor nerve-skeletal muscle). For their work on nerve transmission across chemical synapses, Otto Loewi and Henry Dale received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1936. (○) N8-1

## Electrical synapses directly link the cytoplasm of adjacent cells

Whereas overwhelming support for chemical synaptic transmission accumulated in the first half of the 20th century, the first direct evidence for electrical transmission came much later from electrophysiological recordings of a crayfish nerve preparation. In 1959, Furshpan and Potter used two pairs of stimulating and recording electrodes to show that depolarization of a presynaptic nerve fiber (the crayfish abdominal nerve) resulted in excitation of a postsynaptic nerve cell (the motor nerve to the tail muscle) with virtually no time delay. In contrast, chemical synapses exhibit a characteristic delay of $\sim 1 \mathrm{~ms}$ in the postsynaptic voltage signal after excitation of the presynaptic cell. The demonstration of an electrical synapse between two nerve membranes highlighted an important functional difference between electrical and chemical synapses-immediate signal propagation (electrical) versus briefly delayed communication (chemical) via the junction.

An electrical synapse is a true structural connection formed by connexion channels of gap junctions that link the cytoplasm of two cells (Fig. 8-1). These channels thus provide a low-resistance path for electrotonic current flow and allow voltage signals to flow with little attenuation and no delay between two or more coupled cells. Many types of gap junctions pass electrical current with equal efficiency in both directions-these are termed reciprocal synapses. In other words, the current passing through the gap junction is ohmic; it varies linearly with the transjunctional voltage (i.e., the $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ difference between the two cells). However, the crayfish synapse described by Furshpan and Potter allows depolarizing current to pass readily in only one direction, from the presynaptic cell to the postsynaptic cell. Such electrical synapses are called rectifying synapses to indicate that the underlying junctional conductance is voltage dependent. Studies of cloned and expressed connexins have shown that the voltage dependence of electrical synapses arises from unique gating properties of different connexin isoforms. Some isoforms are voltage dependent; others are voltage independent. Intrinsic rectification can also be altered by the formation of a gap junction that is composed of two hemichannels, each made up of a different connexin monomer. Such hybrid connexins are called heterotypic channels.

Figure 8-1 An electrical synapse. An electrical synapse consists of one or more gap junction channels permeable to small ions and molecules (see Fig. 6-18).

## Chemical synapses use neurotransmitters to provide electrical continuity between adjacent cells

By their very nature, chemical synapses are inherently rectifying or polarized. They propagate current in one direction: from the presynaptic cell that releases the transmitter to the postsynaptic cell that contains the receptors that recognize and bind the transmitter. However, the essentially vectorial nature of chemical synaptic transmission belies the possibility that the postsynaptic cell can influence synapse formation or transmitter release by the presynaptic cell. Studies of synapse development and regulation have shown that postsynaptic cells also play an active role in synapse formation. In the CNS, postsynaptic cells may also produce retrograde signaling molecules, such as nitric oxide (see pp. 315-317), that diffuse back into the presynaptic terminal and modulate the strength of the synaptic connection. Furthermore, the presynaptic membrane at many synapses has receptors that may either inhibit or facilitate the release of transmitter. Thus, chemical synapses should be considered a unidirectional pathway for signal propagation that can be modulated by bidirectional chemical communication between two interacting cells.

The process of chemical transmission can be summarized by the following series of steps (Fig. 8-2):

Step 1: Neurotransmitter molecules are packaged into synaptic vesicles. Vesicular transporters concentrate neurotransmitters inside the vesicle using the energy of an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ electrochemical gradient.

Step 2: An action potential, which involves voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see pp. 176-177), arrives at the presynaptic nerve terminal.
Step 3: Depolarization opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, which allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the presynaptic terminal.
Step 4: The increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right],\right)$ triggers the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic membrane. As a result, packets (quanta) of transmitter molecules are released into the synaptic cleft.
Step 5: The transmitter molecules diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to specific receptors on the membrane of the postsynaptic cell.
Step 6: The binding of transmitter activates the receptor, which in turn activates the postsynaptic cell.
Step 7: The process is terminated by (a) enzymatic destruction of the transmitter (e.g., hydrolysis of ACh by acetylcholinesterase), (b) uptake of transmitter into the presynaptic nerve terminal or into other cells by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent transport systems, or (c) diffusion of the transmitter molecules away from the synapse.

The molecular nature of chemical synapses permits enormous diversity in functional specialization and regulation. Functional diversity occurs at the level of the transmitter substance, receptor protein, postsynaptic response, and subsequent electrical and biochemical processes. Many different small molecules are known-or proposed-to serve as neurotransmitters (see pp. 314-322). These molecules include both small organic molecules, such as norepinephrine, ACh, serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), glutamate, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glycine, and peptides such as endorphins and enkephalins.

## Neurotransmitters can activate ionotropic or metabotropic receptors

Neurotransmitter receptors transduce information by two molecular mechanisms: some are ligand-gated ion channels and others are G protein-coupled receptors (see pp. 51-66). Several neurotransmitter molecules-such as ACh, glutamate, serotonin, GABA, and glycine-serve as ligands (agonists) for both types of receptors. Agonist-gated receptors that are also ion channels are known as ionotropic receptors. Receptors coupled to G proteins are called metabotropic receptors because their activation initiates a metabolic process involving GTP.

Ionotropic and metabotropic receptors determine the ultimate functional response to transmitter release. Activation of an ionotropic receptor causes rapid opening of ion channels. This channel activation, in turn, results in depolarization or hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, depending on the ionic selectivity of the conductance change. Activation of a metabotropic G protein-linked receptor results in the production of active $\alpha$ and $\beta \gamma$ subunits, which initiate a wide variety of cellular responses by direct interaction with either ion channel proteins or other secondmessenger effector proteins. By their very nature, ionotropic receptors mediate fast ionic synaptic responses that occur on a millisecond time scale, whereas metabotropic receptors mediate slow, biochemically mediated synaptic responses in the range of seconds to minutes.

Figure 8-2 A chemical synapse. Synaptic transmission at a chemical synapse can be thought of as occurring in seven steps as shown.

Figure 8-3 compares the basic processes mediated by two prototypic ACh receptors (AChRs): (1) the AChactivated ion channel at the neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscle, an ionotropic receptor also known as the nicotinic AChR (see Fig. 8-3A), and (2) the G proteinlinked AChR at the atrial parasympathetic synapse of the heart, a metabotropic receptor also known as the muscarinic AChR (see Fig. 8-3B). The nicotinic versus muscarinic nomenclature is pharmacological based on whether the AChR is activated by nicotine or muscarine, two natural products that behave like agonists. In the case of the ionotropic (nicotinic) receptor, opening of the AChR channel results in a transient increase in permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, which directly produces a brief depolarization that activates the muscle fiber. In the case of the metabotropic (muscarinic) receptor, activation of the G protein-coupled receptor opens an inward-rectifier $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, or GIRK (see pp. 197198) via $\beta \gamma$ subunits released from an activated heterotrimeric G protein. Enhanced opening of these GIRKs produces membrane hyperpolarization and leads to inhibition of cardiac excitation (see p. 492). These two receptor types provide the molecular explanation for the puzzling observations of early physiologists that ACh (Vagusstoff) activates skeletal muscle but inhibits heart muscle.

## SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION AT THE NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION

## Neuromuscular junctions are specialized synapses between motor neurons and skeletal muscle

The chemical synapse between peripheral motor nerve terminals and skeletal muscle fibers is the most intensely studied synaptic connection in the nervous system. Even though the detailed morphology and the specific molecular components (e.g., neurotransmitters and receptors) differ considerably among different types of synapses, the basic
electrophysiological principles of the neuromuscular junction are applicable to many other types of chemical synapses, including neuronal synaptic connections in the brain, to which we will return in Chapter 13. In this chapter, we focus on the neuromuscular junction in discussing the basic principles of synaptic transmission.

Motor neurons with cell bodies located in the ventral horn of the spinal cord have long axons that branch extensively near the point of contact with the target muscle (Fig. 8-4). Each axon process innervates a separate fiber of skeletal muscle. The whole assembly of muscle fibers innervated by the axon from one motor neuron is called a motor unit.

![bo2114543376c](bo2114543376c.jpg)

Figure 8-4 Vertebrate neuromuscular junction or motor end plate. A motor neuron, with its cell body in the ventral horn of the spinal cord, sends out an axon that progressively bifurcates to innervate several muscle fibers (a motor unit). The neuron contacts a muscle fiber at exactly one spot called a neuromuscular junction or motor end plate. The end plate consists of an arborization of the nerve into many presynaptic terminals, or boutons, as well as the specializations of the postsynaptic membrane. A high-magnification view of a bouton shows that the synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter ACh cluster and line up at the active zone of the presynaptic membrane. The active zones on the presynaptic membrane are directly opposite the secondary postsynaptic clefts that are created by infoldings of the postsynaptic membrane (postjunctional folds). Depolarization of the bouton causes the vesicles to fuse with the presynaptic membrane and to release their contents into the synaptic cleft. The ACh molecules must diffuse at least 50 nm before reaching nicotinic AChRs. Note the high density of AChRs at the crests of the postjunctional folds. The activity of the released ACh is terminated mainly by an AChE. The bouton reloads its discharged synaptic vesicles by resynthesizing ACh and transporting this ACh into the vesicle via an ACh-H exchanger. CoA, coenzyme A.

Typically, an axon makes a single point of synaptic contact with a skeletal muscle fiber, midway along the length of the muscle fiber. This specialized synaptic region is called the neuromuscular junction or the end plate (see Fig. 8-4). An individual end plate consists of a small tree-like patch of unmyelinated nerve processes that are referred to as terminal arborizations. The bulb-shaped endings that finally contact the muscle fiber are called boutons. Schwann cells are intimately associated with the nerve terminal and form a cap over the face of the nerve membrane that is located away from the muscle membrane. The postsynaptic membrane of the skeletal muscle fiber lying directly under the nerve terminal is characterized by extensive invaginations known as postjunctional folds. These membrane infoldings greatly increase the surface area of the muscle plasma membrane in the postsynaptic region. The intervening space of the synaptic cleft, which is $\sim 50 \mathrm{~nm}$ wide, is filled with a meshwork of proteins and proteoglycans that are part of the extracellular matrix. A particular region of the muscle basement membrane called the synaptic basal lamina contains various proteins (e.g., collagen, laminin, agrin) that mediate adhesion of the neuromuscular junction and play important roles in synapse development and regeneration. The synaptic basal lamina also contains a high concentration of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which ultimately terminates synaptic transmission by rapidly hydrolyzing free ACh to choline and acetate.

Electron micrographs of the bouton region demonstrate the presence of numerous spherical synaptic vesicles, each with a diameter of 50 to 60 nm . The cell bodies of motor neurons in the spinal cord produce these vesicles, and the microtubule-mediated process of fast axonal transport (see p. 25) translocates them to the nerve terminal. The quantal nature of transmitter release (described below in more detail) reflects the fusion of individual synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane of the presynaptic terminal. Each synaptic vesicle contains 6000 to 10,000 molecules of ACh. The ACh concentration in synaptic vesicles is $\sim 150 \mathrm{mM}$. ACh is synthesized in the nerve terminal-outside the vesicle-from choline and acetyl coenzyme A by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase. The ACh moves into the synaptic vesicle via a specific ACh-H exchanger, which couples the inward transport of ACh to the efflux of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Energetically, this process is driven by the vesicular proton electrochemical gradient (positive voltage and low pH inside), which in turn is produced by a vacuolar-type H pump fueled by ATP (see pp. 118-119). The nerve terminal also contains numerous mitochondria that produce the ATP required to fuel energy metabolism.

The process of fusion of synaptic vesicles and release of ACh occurs at differentiated regions of the presynaptic membrane called active zones. In electron micrographs, active zones appear as dense spots over which synaptic vesicles are closely clustered in apposition to the membrane. High-resolution images of active zones reveal a double linear array of synaptic vesicles and intramembranous particles. These zones are oriented directly over secondary postsynaptic clefts that lie between adjacent postjunctional folds. Molecular localization studies have shown that the density of ionotropic (nicotinic) AChRs is very high at the crests of postjunctional folds. Examination of the detailed
microarchitecture of the neuromuscular synapse thus reveals a highly specialized structure for delivery of neurotransmitter molecules to a precise location on the postsynaptic membrane.

## ACh activates nicotinic AChRs to produce an excitatory end-plate current

Electrophysiological experiments on muscle fibers have characterized the electrical nature of the postsynaptic response at the muscle end plate. Figure 8-5 illustrates results obtained from a classic experiment performed by Fatt and Katz in 1951. Their work is the first description of how stimulation of the motor nerve affects the membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ at the postsynaptic region (i.e., muscle cell) of the neuromuscular junction. Nerve stimulation normally drives the $V_{m}$ of the muscle above threshold and elicits an action potential (see p. 173). However, Fatt and Katz were interested not in seeing the action potential but in studying the small graded electrical responses that are produced as ACh binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane. Therefore, Fatt and Katz greatly reduced the response of the AChRs by blocking most of them with a carefully selected concentration of $d$-tubocurarine, which we discuss below. N8-2 They inserted a KCl -filled microelectrode into the end-plate region of a frog sartorius muscle fiber. This arrangement allowed them to measure tiny changes in $V_{m}$ at one location of the muscle cell called the neuromuscular junction or NMJ.

When Fatt and Katz electrically excited the motor nerve axon, they observed a transient depolarization in the muscle membrane after a delay of a few milliseconds. The delay represents the time required for the release of ACh, its diffusion across the synapse, and activation of postsynaptic AChRs. The positive voltage change follows a biphasic time course: $V_{m}$ rapidly rises to a peak and then more slowly relaxes back to the resting value, consistent with an exponential time course. This signal, known as the end-plate potential (EPP), is an example of an excitatory postsynaptic potential. It is produced by the transient opening of AChR channels, which are selectively permeable to monovalent cations such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance drives $V_{m}$ to a more positive value in the vicinity of the endplate region. In this experiment, curare blockade allows only a small number of AChR channels to open, so that the EPP does not reach the threshold to produce an action potential. If the experiment is repeated by inserting the microelectrode at various distances from the end plate, the amplitude of the potential change is successively diminished and its peak is increasingly delayed. This decrement with distance occurs because the EPP originates at the end-plate region and spreads away from this site according to the passive cable properties (see pp. 201-203) of the muscle fiber. Thus, the EPP in Figure 8-5 is an example of a propagated graded response. However, without the curare blockade, more AChR channels would open and a larger EPP would ensue, which would drive $V_{m}$ above threshold and consequently trigger a regenerating action potential (see p. 173).

What ions pass through the AChR channels during generation of the EPP? This question can be answered by the same voltage-clamp technique (1) N1-4 that was used to study the basis of the action potential (see Fig. 7-5B).

Figure 8-6A illustrates the experimental preparation for a two-electrode voltage-clamp experiment in which the motor nerve is stimulated while the muscle fiber in the region of its end plate is voltage-clamped to a chosen $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. The recorded current, which is proportional to the conductance change at the muscle end plate, is called the end-plate current (EPC). The EPC has a characteristic time course that rises to a peak within 2 ms after stimulation of the motor nerve and falls

Figure 8-6 EPCs obtained at different membrane potentials in a voltageclamp experiment. A, Two-electrode voltage clamp is used to measure the EPC in a frog muscle fiber. The tips of the two microelectrodes are in the muscle fiber. B, The six records represent EPCs that were obtained while the motor nerve was stimulated and the postsynaptic membrane was clamped to $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ values of $-120,-91,-68,-37,+24$, and +38 mV . Notice that the peak current reverses from inward to outward as the holding potential shifts from -37 to +24 mV . C, The reversal potential is near 0 mV because the nicotinic AChR has a poor selectivity for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ versus $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. (Data from Magleby KL, Stevens CF: The effect of voltage on the time course of end-plate current. J Physiol 223:151-171, 1975.)
exponentially back to zero (see Fig. 8-6B). The time course of the EPC corresponds to the opening and closing of a population of AChR channels, governed by the rapid binding and disappearance of ACh as it diffuses to the postsynaptic membrane and is hydrolyzed by AChE.

As shown in Figure 8-6B, when the muscle fiber is clamped to a "holding potential" of -120 mV , we observe a large inward current (i.e., the EPC). This inward current decreases in magnitude as $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ is made more positive, and the current reverses direction to become an outward current at positive values of $V_{\mathrm{m}}$. A plot of the peak current versus the clamped $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ shows that the reversal potential for the EPC is close to 0 mV (see Fig. 8-6C). Because the EPC specifically corresponds to current through AChR channels, this reversal potential reflects the ionic selectivity of these channels when extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentrations ( $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ ) are normal.

By varying the concentrations of the extracellular ions while monitoring the shift in the reversal potential of the EPC, researchers found that the AChR channel is permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ but not to anions such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Because of its low extracellular concentration, the current attributable to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is small under physiological conditions and its contribution to reversal potential can be ignored. (5) N8-3 By plugging the values for the various cations into the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz voltage equation (see Equation 6-9), one can obtain the permeability of the AChR channel to various alkali monovalent ions relative to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability. The result is the following sequence of relative permeability: 0.87 $\left(\mathrm{Li}^{+}\right), 1.00\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right), 1.11\left(\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right)$, and $1.42\left(\mathrm{Cs}^{+}\right)$. This weak ionic selectivity stands in marked contrast to typical voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, which have $P_{\mathrm{Na}} / P_{\mathrm{K}}$ ratios of $\sim 20$, and voltagegated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which have $P_{\mathrm{K}} / P_{\mathrm{Na}}$ ratios of $>100$. On this basis, the ionotropic (nicotinic) AChR channel at the muscle end plate is often classified as a nonselective cation channel. Nevertheless, the weak ionic selectivity of the AChR is well suited to its basic function of raising $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ above the threshold of about -50 mV , which is necessary for firing of an action potential. When the nicotinic AChR channel at the muscle end plate opens, the normally high resting permeability of the muscle plasma membrane for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$relative to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$falls so that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$become equally permeant and $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ shifts to a value between $E_{\mathrm{K}}$ (approximately -80 mV ) and $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ (approximately +50 mV ).

As we shall see in Chapter 13, which focuses on synaptic transmission in the CNS, similar principles hold for the generation of postsynaptic currents by other types of agonistgated channels. For example, the receptor-gated channels for serotonin and glutamate are cation selective and give rise to depolarizing excitatory postsynaptic potentials. In contrast, the receptor-gated channels for glycine and GABA are anion selective and drive $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in the hyperpolarizing direction, toward the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. These hyperpolarizing postsynaptic responses are called inhibitory postsynaptic potentials.

## The nicotinic AChR is a member of the pentameric Cys-loop receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels

The molecular nature of the nicotinic AChR channel was revealed by studies that included protein purification, aminoacid sequencing of isolated subunits, molecular cloning, and cryoelectron microscopy. Purification of the receptor was aided by the recognition that the electric organs of certain fish are a particularly rich source of the nicotinic AChR. In the electric eel and torpedo ray, the electric organs are
embryologically derived from skeletal muscle. The torpedo ray can deliver large electrical discharges by summating the simultaneous depolarizations of a stack of many disk-like cells called electrocytes. These cells have the skeletal muscle isoform of the nicotinic AChR, which is activated by ACh released from presynaptic terminals.

The purified torpedo AChR consists of four subunits ( $\alpha$, $\beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ ) in a pentameric stoichiometry of $2 \alpha: 1 \beta: 1 \gamma: 1 \delta$ (Fig. 8-7). Each subunit has a molecular mass of $\sim 50 \mathrm{kDa}$ and is homologous to the other subunits. The primary sequences of nicotinic AChR subunits are $\sim 90 \%$ identical between the torpedo ray and human.

The $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ subunits each have four distinct hydrophobic regions known as M1 to M4, which correspond to membrane-spanning segments. For each of the subunits, the M2 transmembrane segment lines the aqueous pore through which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$cross the membrane.

The pentameric complex has two agonist binding sites. The two ACh binding sites are located at the extracellular $\alpha / \gamma$ interface of one $\alpha$ subunit and the $\alpha / \delta$ interface of the other $\alpha$ subunit. (6) N8-4

AChRs of normal adult muscle fibers are present in high density in the junctional folds of the postsynaptic membrane. However, in developing muscle fibers of the mammalian embryo and in denervated fibers of adult skeletal muscle, AChRs are also widely distributed in the membrane outside the end-plate region. The two types of AChRs, called junctional and nonjunctional receptors, have different functional properties. The unitary conductance of nonjunctional receptors is $\sim 50 \%$ larger and the single-channel lifetime is longer in duration than that of junctional receptors. The basis for this phenomenon is a difference in subunit composition. The nonjunctional (or fetal) receptors are a pentameric complex with a subunit composition of $\alpha_{1} \beta \gamma \delta$ in mammals, just as in the electric organ of the torpedo ray. For the junctional AChR in adult skeletal muscle, substitution of an $\varepsilon$ subunit for the fetal $\gamma$ subunit results in a complex with the composition $\alpha_{2} \beta \varepsilon \delta$.

The functional properties of the two types of receptors have been studied in preparations of Xenopus oocytes that coexpress the cloned subunits. Figure 8-8A shows patchclamp recordings of single ACh-activated channels in oocytes that had been injected with mRNA encoding either $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, $\delta$ or $\alpha, \beta, \varepsilon, \delta$. Measurements of currents at different voltages yielded single-channel current-voltage (I-V) curves (see Fig. $8-8 B$ ) showing that the channel formed with the $\varepsilon$ subunit had a unitary conductance of 59 picosiemens (pS), whereas that formed with the $\gamma$ subunit had a conductance of 40 pS . The mean lifetime of single-channel openings at 0 mV was 1.6 ms for $\varepsilon$-type and 4.4 ms for $\gamma$-type receptors, which closely corresponds to values found in native fetal and adult muscle, respectively. The different functional properties of junctional and nonjunctional nicotinic AChRs presumably reflect their specialized roles in synaptic transmission versus development and synapse formation.

Humans have ten genes (CHRNA1 to CHRNA10) that encode homologous $\alpha$ subunits $\alpha_{1}$ to $\alpha_{10}$ of nicotinic AChactivated receptors (see Fig. 6-20O). Humans also have four genes (CHRNB1 to CHRNB4) that encode $\beta$ subunits $\beta_{1}$ to $\beta_{4}$, as well as separate genes encoding $\gamma_{1} \delta$, and $\varepsilon$ subunits. The skeletal muscle receptor comprises two $\alpha_{1}$ subunits, one

Equation 6-9 in the text (shown here as Equation NE 8-1) is the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) voltage equation:

$$
V_{\text {rev }}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(\frac{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{2}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}}{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}+P_{2}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}\right) \quad(\mathrm{NE} 8-1)
$$

Of course, we could insert additional terms for other cations besides $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$; for example, if we included $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the equation would look something like the following*:

$$
V_{\text {rev }}=\frac{R T}{F} \ln \left(\frac{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Cu}}\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Cr}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}{P_{0}\left[\mathrm{~K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Na}}\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Cu}}\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}+P_{\mathrm{Cr}}\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}}\right)
$$

(NE 8-2)
A typical value for $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ would be $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ or $0.0001 \mathrm{mM}$, and a typical value for $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ would be 1.2 mM . Thus, even though the concentration ratio for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the plasma membrane is large, this ratio per se has no bearing on the GHK equation. What counts here are the magnitudes of the product $P_{\mathrm{cu}}\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ which are generally small compared to the other terms in both the numerator and denominator. Thus, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ makes very little contribution to $V_{\mathrm{in}}$ in the resting state. However, if we were to reduce the size of the other terms in either the numerator or denominator, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ would begin to matter.

## N8-4 Ligand-Binding Sites of the Nicotinic AChRs

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

New insight into molecular details of the extracellular agonistbinding domain of AChR has been obtained from the x-ray crystal structure of an ACh-binding protein (AChBP) from Lymnaea stagnalis, a freshwater snail. AChBP is a soluble protein of 229 residues that is homologous to the aminoterminal region of nicotinic AChR and other members of the pentameric ligand-gated channel superfamily. As shown in Figure 3 of the paper by Brejc and colleagues, the crystal structure demonstrates that AChBP is formed as a radially symmetrical homopentamer of the monomer subunit with the agonist-binding site located between the five subunit interfaces. The tertiary structure of a single monomer subunit of AChBP features ten $\beta$ strands folded into a $\beta$ sandwich. The snail AChBP specifically binds many of the same agonist and antagonist molecules as AChR, including ACh, carbamylcholine, nicotine, d-tubocurarine, and $\alpha$-bungarotoxin. AChBP serves as a particularly good homology model for the structure of nicotinic receptors in the mammalian nervous system that are formed as homopentamers of $\alpha$ subunits.

Figure 8-7 Structure of the Torpedo nicotinic AChR. The nicotinic AChR receptor is a heteropentamer with the subunit composition of $\alpha_{1} \beta \gamma \delta$. These subunits are homologous to one another, and each has four membrane-spanning segments (M1 to M4).

$\beta_{1}$, one $\delta$, and one $\varepsilon$ in the adult receptor but one $\gamma$ in the fetal receptor. Various heteromeric combinations of the other $\alpha$ subunits ( $\alpha_{2}$ to $\alpha_{10}$ ) and $\beta$ subunits ( $\beta_{2}$ to $\beta_{4}$ ) produce a diverse array of functional receptor isoforms in neurons. Whereas muscle AChRs can be activated only by high concentrations of nicotine, the neuronal $\left(\alpha_{4}\right)_{2}\left(\beta_{2}\right)_{3} \mathrm{AChR}$ isoform in the CNS and autonomic ganglia has the highest affinity for nicotine and is responsible for the behavioral and addictive effects of nicotine in tobacco. The $\alpha$ subunits $\alpha_{1}$, $\alpha_{7}$, and $\alpha_{9}$ bind a snake venom protein called $\alpha$-bungarotoxin (see p. 226) from the Taiwanese banded krait.

The nicotinic AChRs belong to the pentameric Cys-loop receptor family of ligand-gated ion channels (see Table 6-2, family No. 11), so named because they contain a highly conserved pair of disulfide-bonded cysteine residues. This family also contains three other classes of agonist-activated channels, those activated by serotonin ( $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor), glycine (GlyR), and GABA (GABA ${ }_{\mathrm{A}}$ receptor). As is the case for the AChRs, the $5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}$ receptor channels are permeable to cations and thus produce excitatory currents. In contrast, glycine-activated and $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ channels are permeable to anions such as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and produce inhibitory currents. Figure $8-9$ shows examples of macroscopic and unitary $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$currents mediated by glycine-activated and $\mathrm{GABA}_{\mathrm{A}}$ channels. Cloned genes encoding subunits of these receptor channels encode proteins that are homologous to AChR subunits. Their primary amino-acid sequences share a common arrangement of M1, M2, M3, and M4 transmembrane segments, as described above for the nicotinic AChR (see Fig. 8-7). Sequence analysis of these genes indicates that they evolved
from a common ancestor. The basis for cation versus anion selectivity appears to reside solely within the M2 segment. Mutation of only three residues within the M2 segment of a cation-selective $\alpha$ subunit of a neuronal nicotinic AChR is sufficient to convert it to an anion-selective channel activated by ACh.

## Activation of AChR channels requires binding of two ACh molecules

The EPC is the sum of many single-channel currents, each representing the opening of a single AChR channel at the neuromuscular junction. Above we described the random opening and closing of an idealized channel in a two-state model in which the channel could be either closed or open (see p. 181):

$$
\mathrm{C} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{O}
$$

In the case of an agonist-activated channel, such as the AChR channel, binding of an agonist to the channel in its closed state favors channel opening. This gating process may be represented by the following kinetic model:
![bo2174543376c](bo2174543376c.jpg)

In this two-step scheme, the closed state (C) of the channel must bind one molecule of the agonist ACh to form a closed

# N8-14 Structure of the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), which are all ligand-gated ion channels, come in two major subtypes, $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ nicotinic AChRs are at the neuromuscular junction, whereas the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ AChRs are found in the autonomic nervous system (on the postsynaptic membrane of the postganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic neurons) and in the CNS. Both $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ are ligand-gated ion channels activated by ACh or nicotine. However, whereas the $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ receptors at the neuromuscular junction are stimulated by decamethonium and preferentially blocked by $\delta$-tubocurarine and $\alpha$-bungarotoxin, the autonomic $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are stimulated by tetramethylammonium, blocked by hexamethonium, but resistant to $\alpha$-bungarotoxin. When activated, $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors are both permeable to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, with the entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$dominating. Thus, the nicotinic stimulation leads to rapid depolarization.

The nicotinic AChRs in skeletal muscle and autonomic ganglia are heteropentamers. That is, five nonidentical protein subunits surround a central pore, in a rosette fashion. (5) N6-20 Because the five subunits are not identical, the structure exhibits pseudosymmetry, rather than true symmetry. There are at least ten $\alpha$
subunits $\left(\alpha_{1}\right.$ to $\left.\alpha_{10}\right)$ and four $\beta$ subunits ( $\beta_{1}$ to $\beta_{4}$ ). As we will see below, the basis for these differences is a difference in subunit composition.

The $\mathbf{N}_{1}$ receptors have different subunit compositions depending upon location and developmental stage. The subunit composition of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{3} \beta \gamma \delta$ is found in fetal skeletal muscle, as well as the nonjunctional regions of denervated adult skeletal muscle. The electric organ of the electric eel (Torpedo), from which the channel was first purified, has the same subunit composition. The subunit composition of $\alpha_{3} \beta \varepsilon \delta$ is found at the neuromuscular junction of adult skeletal muscle. Here, the $\varepsilon$ subunit replaces the $\gamma$ subunit. In both the $\alpha_{3} \beta \gamma \delta$ and $\alpha_{3} \beta \varepsilon \delta$ pentamers, the $\alpha$ subunits are of the $\alpha_{1}$ subtype and the $\beta$ subunits are of the $\beta_{1}$ subtype.

In the Torpedo $\mathrm{N}_{1}$ AChRs, the $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$, and $\delta$ subunits have polypeptide lengths of 437 to 501 amino acids. eFigure 8-1 shows side and top views of this AChR.

The $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ receptors in the nervous system, like those in muscle, are heteromers, probably heteropentamers. $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ receptors use $\alpha_{2}$ to $\alpha_{10}$ and $\beta_{2}$ to $\beta_{4}$.

Figure 8-8 Properties of fetal and adult AChRs from skeletal muscle. A, The results of patch-clamp experiments, with the patch pipettes in the outside-out configuration and the patch exposed to $0.5 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{ACh}$, are summarized. In the upper panel, recordings are from Xenopus oocytes that expressed the fetal AChR, which has the subunit composition $\alpha_{2} \beta \gamma \delta$. In the lower panel, the oocytes expressed the adult AChR, which has the subunit composition $\alpha_{2} \beta \varepsilon \delta$. Notice that the mean open times are greater for the fetal form, whereas the unitary currents are greater for the adult form. B, The two lines summarize data that are similar to those shown in A. The single channel conductance of the adult form ( 59 pS ) is higher than that of the fetal form ( 40 pS ).

agonist-bound channel (AC) before it can convert to an open agonist-bound channel (AO). However, studies of the dependence of the probability of channel opening on agonist concentration indicate that binding of two molecules of ACh is required for channel opening. This feature of nicotinic receptor gating is described by the following modification of Equation 8-2:
![bo2204543376c](bo2204543376c.jpg)

The kinetics of channel opening are important for understanding the mechanism by which certain channel inhibitors work. For example, a competitive antagonist such as $d$ tubocurarine prevents the binding of the agonist ACh to
each of its two sites. However, many noncompetitive antagonists of the AChR channel, including some local anesthetics, act by entering the lumen of the channel and blocking the flow of ionic current. Figure 8-10A shows the results of a patch-clamp experiment in which a single AChR channel opened and closed in response to its agonist, ACh. After the addition of QX-222, an analog of the local anesthetic agent lidocaine (see pp. 187-189), to the extracellular side, the channel exhibits a rapidly flickering behavior. This flickering represents a series of brief interruptions of the open state by numerous closures (see Fig. 8-10B). This type of flickering block is caused by rapid binding and unbinding of the anesthetic drug to a site in the mouth of the open channel. When the drug binds, it blocks the channel to the flow of ions $\left(\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{~B}\right)$. Conversely, when the drug dissociates, the channel becomes unblocked $\left(\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{~A}_{1} \mathrm{C} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{C} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{~A}_{2} \mathrm{~B} \\
& \text { Blocked }
\end{aligned}
$$

Channel blockers are often used as molecular tools to study the mechanism of ion permeation. For example, studies with the blocker QX-222-in combination with sitedirected mutagenesis-helped to localize the blocker binding site on the M2 transmembrane segment, thus identifying residues that line the aqueous pore.

## Miniature EPPs reveal the quantal nature of transmitter release from the presynaptic terminals

Under physiological conditions, an action potential in a presynaptic motor nerve axon produces a depolarizing postsynaptic EPP that peaks at a level $\sim 40 \mathrm{mV}$ more positive than the resting $V_{m}$. This large signal results from the release of ACh from only about 200 synaptic vesicles, each containing 6000 to 10,000 molecules of ACh. The neuromuscular junction is clearly designed for excess capacity inasmuch as a single end plate is composed of numerous synaptic contacts ( $\sim 1000$ at the frog muscle end plate), each with an active zone that is lined with dozens of mature synaptic vesicles. Thus, a large inventory of ready vesicles $\left(>10^{4}\right)$, together with the ability to synthesize ACh and to package it into new vesicles, allows the neuromuscular junction to maintain a high rate of successful transmission without significant loss of function as a result of presynaptic depletion of vesicles or ACh.

The original notion of a vesicular mode of transmitter delivery is based on classic observations of EPPs under conditions of reduced ACh release. In 1950, Fatt and Katz observed an interesting kind of electrophysiological "noise" in their continuous high-resolution recordings of $V_{m}$ with a microelectrode inserted at the end-plate region of a frog muscle fiber. Their recordings from resting muscle fibers that were not subjected to nerve stimulation revealed the occurrence of tiny depolarizations of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{mV}$ that appeared at random intervals. These small depolarizations were blocked by the AChR antagonist curare and they increased in size and duration with application of the AChE inhibitor neostigmine. Because the spontaneous $V_{m}$ fluctuations also exhibited a time course similar to that of the normal EPP, they were named miniature end-plate potentials (also known as

MEPPs or minis). These observations suggested that even in the absence of nerve stimulation, there is a certain low probability of transmitter release at the presynaptic terminal, resulting in the opening of a small number of AChRs in the postsynaptic membrane. An examination of the size of individual MEPPs suggested that they occur in discrete multiples of a unitary amplitude. This finding led to the notion that ACh release is quantized, with the quantal event corresponding to ACh release from one synaptic vesicle.

Another way of studying the quantal release of ACh is to stimulate the presynaptic motor neuron and to monitor $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ at the end plate under conditions in which the probability of ACh release is greatly decreased by lowering $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ and increasing $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]_{o}$. Low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry into the presynaptic terminal (see Fig. 8-2, step 3). High $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ partially blocks the presynaptic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and thus also decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. Therefore, the consequence of either decreased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ or increased $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ is a fall in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in the presynaptic terminal, which reduces transmitter release and thus the amplitude of the EPP (Fig. 8-11). Del Castillo and Katz exploited this suppression of transmitter release under conditions of low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ and high $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ to observe the $V_{\mathrm{ss}}$ changes caused by the quantal release of transmitter. Figure 8-12A shows seven superimposed records of MEPPs that were recorded from a frog muscle fiber during seven repetitive trials of nerve stimulation under conditions of reduced $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ and elevated $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]_{o}$. The records are aligned at the position of the nerve stimulus artifact. The amplitudes of the peak responses occur in discrete multiples of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{mV}$.

Among the seven records were one "nonresponse," two responses of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{mV}$, three responses of $\sim 0.8 \mathrm{mV}$, and one response of $\sim 1.2 \mathrm{mV}$. One of the recordings also revealed a spontaneous MEPP with a quantal amplitude of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{mV}$ that appeared later in the trace. Del Castillo and Katz proposed that the macroscopic EPP is the sum of many unitary events, each having a magnitude of $\sim 0.4 \mathrm{mV}$ (see Fig. 8-12B). Microscopic observation of numerous vesicles in the synaptic terminal naturally led to the hypothesis that a single vesicle releases a relatively fixed amount of ACh and thereby produces a unitary MEPP. According to this view the quantized MEPPs thus correspond to the fusion of discrete numbers of synaptic vesicles: $0,1,2,3$, and so on. (C) N8-5

## Direct sensing of extracellular transmitter also shows quantal release of transmitter

Instead of using the postsynaptic AChR as a biological detector of quantum release, one can use a microscopic electrochemical sensor to measure neurotransmitter levels directly. Figure 8-13 shows results from an experiment in which a fine carbon-fiber electrode was placed very close to the presynaptic terminal membrane of a leech neuron that uses serotonin as its only neurotransmitter. The carbon fiber is an electrochemical detector of serotonin (see Fig. 8-13A); the current measured by this electrode corresponds to four

# N8-5 Quantal Nature of Transmitter Release 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The quantal nature of transmitter release can be expressed quantitatively by postulating that a nerve terminal contains a population of $N$ quanta or vesicles and that each has a finite probability $(P)$ of releasing under any given set of conditions. Thus, the mean number $(m)$ of quanta released after any single nerve impulse is

$$
m=N \times P
$$

(NE 8-3)
Figure 8-12B in the text illustrates the results of an experiment very similar to that producing the data shown in Figure 8-12A, except that the investigators—Boyd and Martin—repeated the nerve stimulation 198 times, rather than 7 times as in Figure 8-12A. In each case, Boyd and Martin recorded the magnitude of the MEPP and placed it into a "bin" that was 0.1 mV wide. Thus, if they observed a MEPP of 1.23 mV , they placed it into the 1.2 bin. Figure 8-12B, a histogram summarizing the results of the 198 nerve-evoked responses, shows a series of peaks. The peak at 0 mV corresponds to the 18 trials in which the nerve stimulus evoked no end-plate potential. The peaks labeled I, II, III, and so on correspond to MEPPs that are multiples of the unit eventwhich is 0.4 mV -at amplitudes of $0.4 \mathrm{mV}, 0.8 \mathrm{mV}, 1.2 \mathrm{mV}$, and so forth. Thus, peak I corresponds to 1 quantum released, peak II corresponds to 2 quanta released, and so on.

If we sum up all the MEPPs in the 198 trials, we see that the total change in $V_{m}$ was 184 mV . Dividing by 198 produces the mean amplitude of the MEPPs, 0.93 mV . If we assume a unitary response of $0.4 \mathrm{mV}, 0.93 \mathrm{mV}$ corresponds to 2.3 quanta, which is the $m$ in Equation NE 8-3. Thus, on average, a nerve impulse produces a MEPP of 0.93 mV , which corresponds to the release of 2.3 quanta. However, in any given nerve impulse, the actual MEPP-if we could measure it with perfect accuracy-must correspond to an integral number of quanta released ( $x=0,1,2,3$, ...). Of course, because of noise and inaccuracies in the measuring system, Boyd and Martin also measured MEPPs that corresponded to nonintegral numbers of quanta. The $y$-axis in Figure 8-12B gives the number of times Boyd and Martin observed a given MEPP, out of the total of 198 observations. The seven bell-shaped or gaussian curves in Figure 8-12B represent the probability of releasing $1,2,3,4,5,6$, or 7 quanta.

Because each bin is 0.1 mV wide, and because the unitary MEPP is 0.4 mV , Boyd and Martin added up 0.4/0.1 or four consecutive bins to obtain the number of observations $\left(n_{x}\right)$ corresponding to the release of $x$ quanta, out of the total of 198 observations ( $n_{\text {total }}$ ). For example, for $x=0$ quanta, $n_{0}$ was 18 ; for $x=1$ quantum, $n_{1}$ was 44 ; the second column in eTable 8-1 in this webnote gives the number of events observed $\left(n_{x}\right)$ for each number of quanta $x$ (listed in the first column). The probability $\left(p_{x}\right)$ that we saw $x$ quanta being released after a single nerve impulse is

$$
p_{x}=\frac{n_{x}}{n_{\text {total }}}
$$

(NE 8-4)
Thus, for $x=0, p_{0}$ would be $18 / 198$ or 0.091 ; for $x=1, p_{1}$ would be $44 / 198$ or 0.222 ; the other values are given in the third column of eTable 8-1.

## eTABLE 8-1 Poisson Distribution of Quanta Released During Nerve Stimulation

| NUMBER <br> OF <br> QUANTA <br> $(x)$ | NUMBER <br> OF EVENTS <br> OBSERVED <br> $(n /)$ | PROBABILITY <br> OBSERVED | PROBABILITY <br> PREDICTED |
| :-- | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| 0 | 18 | 0.091 | 0.100 |

| 7 | 2 | 0.010 | 0.007 |
| 8 | 1 | 0.005 | 0.002 |

How do these observed values agree with those predicted by probability theory? Probability theory predicts that $p_{x}$ should follow a Poisson distribution:

$$
p_{x}=\frac{m^{x}}{x!} e^{-m}
$$

(NE 8-5)

Note that $m$ in this equation is once again the mean number of quanta released per nerve impulse, 2.3 in our example. This theory assumes that the underlying probability of vesicle release ( $P$ in Equation NE 8-3) is very small and that the population of replenishable vesicles ( $N$ in Equation NE 8-3) is very large. The fourth column of eTable 8-1 shows that the $p_{x}$ predicted by Equation NE 8-5 is very nearly the same as the observed $p_{x}$ for each number of quanta.

We can also check the agreement of the data with the theory by testing whether the observed number of blank records ( $0-\mathrm{mV}$ events) can predict the mean number $(m)$ of quanta released after any single nerve impulse. According to Equation NE 8-5, when $x=0$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& p_{0}=\frac{m^{0}}{0!} e^{-m}=\frac{1}{1} e^{-m}=e^{-m} \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { in } p_{0}=-m
\end{aligned}
$$

Because $p_{0}$ is $18 / 198$ or 0.091 , the $m$ value that we compute from Equation NE 8-6 is 2.4 quanta. This value is very close to the measured mean of 2.3 quanta. Findings such as these have provided strong support for the quantal theory of neurotransmitter release at the neuromuscular junction.

electrons per serotonin molecule oxidized at the tip. Stimulation of the leech neuron to produce an action potential also elicits an oxidation current, as measured by the carbon fiber, that corresponds to the release of serotonin. At a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ of 5 mM , the current is large and composed of many small spikes (see Fig. 8-13B, top). On the other hand, reducing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ to $1 \mathrm{mM}$-presumably reducing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx into the nerve terminal and thus reducing the number of quanta released-reveals individual spikes of serotonin release. The release spikes come in two sizes, small and large (see Fig. 8-13B, bottom), corresponding to two separate classes of synaptic vesicles that are evident on electron micrographs. Injection of the cell with tetanus toxin, which blocks the release of synaptic vesicles, abolishes the serotonin release spikes. Thus, the spikes represent genuine events of synaptic exocytosis.

The nearly immediate appearance of the small release spikes after electrical stimulation of the cell shows that this type of vesicular release is extremely rapid. From the height and duration of the small and large spikes in Figure 8-13B, one can estimate the amount of electrical charge and thus

Figure 8-11 Effect of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ on EPPs. The data obtained by stimulating the motor neuron and monitoring the evoked subthreshold EPP show that the EPP is stimulated by increasing levels of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ but inhibited by increasing levels of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. (Data from Dodge FA Jr, Rahaminoff R: Cooperative action of calcium ions in transmitter release at the neuromuscular junction. J Physiol 193:419-432, 1967.)
the number of serotonin molecules oxidized at the carbon fiber per spike. A unitary small event corresponds to the release of $\sim 4700$ serotonin molecules, whereas a unitary large event corresponds to the release of 15,000 to 300,000 serotonin molecules. Thus, the amount of serotonin released by the small synaptic vesicles of the leech neuron is about half the number of ACh molecules contained in a synaptic vesicle at the frog neuromuscular junction. These and other observations of the synaptic function of nerve-muscle and nervenerve synapses have led to the conclusion that chemical neurotransmission operates by a fundamentally similar mechanism at many types of synapses in different animal species (see Chapter 13).

Short-term or long-term changes in the relative efficiency of neurotransmitter release can increase or decrease the strength of a particular synapse and thereby give rise to an alteration in behavior. Three types of synaptic modulation occur at the neuromuscular junction, and they differ in how they affect the quantal release of neurotransmitter: (5) N8-7

Facilitation is a short-lived enhancement of the EPP in response to a brief increase in the frequency of nerve stimulation. One way that facilitation may occur is by a transient increase in the mean number of quanta per nerve stimulus.

Potentiation (or post-tetanic potentiation) is a long-lived and pronounced increase in transmitter release that occurs after a long period of high-frequency nerve stimulation. This effect can last for minutes after the conditioning stimulus. Potentiation may be caused by a period of intense nerve firing, which increases $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in the presynaptic terminal and thus increases the probability of exocytosis.

Synaptic depression is a transient decrease in the efficiency of transmitter release and, consequently, a reduction

# N8-7 Modulation of Quantal Release 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

As discussed in C N8-5, the quantal nature of transmitter release can be expressed quantitatively by postulating that a nerve terminal contains a population of $N$ quanta or vesicles and that each has a finite probability $(P)$ of releasing under any given set of conditions. Thus, the mean number $(m)$ of quanta released after any single nerve impulse is

$$
m=N \times P
$$

(NE 8-7)
As noted in the text, facilitation is a short-lived enhancement of the postsynaptic potential in response to a brief increase in the frequency of nerve stimulation. One way facilitation may occur is by a transient increase in the mean number of quanta per nerve stimulus, corresponding to an increase in the $m$ parameter of Equation NE 8-7.

Potentiation is a long-lived and pronounced increase in transmitter release that occurs after a long period of highfrequency nerve stimulation. This effect can last for minutes after the conditioning stimulus. Potentiation may be caused by a period of intense nerve firing, which increases $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in the presynaptic terminal and thus increases the probability of exocytosis (the $P$ parameter in Equation NE 8-7).

Synaptic depression is a transient decrease in the efficiency of transmitter release-and, consequently, a reduction in the postsynaptic potential-in response to a period of frequent nerve stimulation. Depression may result from a temporary depletion of transmitter-loaded vesicles in the presynaptic terminal-that is, a reduction in the number of available quanta, corresponding to the parameter $N$ in Equation NE 8-7.

Thus, these three temporal changes in synaptic strength and efficiency appear to reflect changes at different steps of synaptic transmission. Similar modulation of synaptic strength in the CNS provides a mechanistic paradigm for understanding how individual nerve terminals may "learn."

Figure 8-12 Evoked and spontaneous MEPPs. A, The investigators recorded $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ in frog skeletal muscle fibers that were exposed to extracellular solutions having a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ of 0.5 mM and $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ of 5 mM . These values minimize transmitter release, and therefore it was possible to resolve the smallest possible MEPP, which corresponds to the release of a single synaptic vesicle (i.e., 1 quantum). The investigators stimulated the motor neuron seven consecutive times and recorded the evoked MEPPs. In one trial, the stimulus evoked no response ( 0 quanta). In two trials, the peak MEPP was about 0.4 mV ( 1 quantum). In three others, the peak response was about 0.8 mV ( 2 quanta). Finally, in one, the peak was about 1.2 mV ( 3 quanta). In one case, a MEPP of the smallest magnitude appeared spontaneously. B, The histogram summarizes data from 198 trials on a cat neuromuscular junction in the presence of 12.5 mM extracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. The data are in bins with a width of 0.1 mV . The distribution has eight peaks. The first represents stimuli that evoked no responses. The other seven represent stimuli that evoked MEPPs that were roughly integral multiples of the smallest MEPP. The curve overlying each cluster of bins is a gaussian or "normal" function and facilitates calculation of the average MEPP for each cluster of bins. The peak values of these gaussians follow a Poisson distribution. (Data from Magleby KL: Neuromuscular transmission. In Engel AG, Franzini-Armstrong C [eds]: Myology: Basic and Clinical, 2nd ed.

Depression may result from temporary depletion of transmitter-loaded vesicles from the presynaptic terminal, that is, a reduction in the number of available quanta. Thus, these three temporal changes in synaptic strength and efficiency appear to reflect changes at different steps of synaptic transmission. Similar modulation of synaptic strength in the CNS provides a mechanistic paradigm to understand
how individual nerve terminals may "learn" and "remember" (see p. 328).

Figure 8-13 Detection of serotonin that is released from synaptic vesicles. A, The serotonin that is released from a synaptic terminal of a leech neuron can be detected electrochemically by use of a carbon-fiber microelectrode. The current carried by the carbon fiber increases with the amount of serotonin that is released, reflecting the oxidation of serotonin molecules on the surface of the carbon fiber. B, The top panel shows the action potential recorded from the stimulated motor neuron. The middle panel shows the evoked serotonin release (measured as a current) at both a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ of 5 mM (high level of serotonin release) and a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ of 1 mM (lower level or release). The bottom panel shows results of five consecutive trials at a $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$ of 1 mM and illustrates that the release of serotonin can occur in either small quanta or very large quanta. These two sizes of quanta correspond to small clear vesicles and large dense-core vesicles, both of which can be observed by electron microscopy.

secretory cells in animals from the most primitive invertebrates up to mammals (see pp. 35-37). Many proteins involved in synaptic vesicle movement and turnover are related to those involved in intracellular membrane trafficking in almost all eukaryotic cells. This trafficking involves vesicular translocation from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi network and fusion with the plasma membrane. Genetic analysis of the yeast secretory pathway has identified various gene products that are homologous to those associated with synaptic vesicles of higher vertebrates. Thus, the processes underlying synaptic function are inherently quite similar to cellular exocytosis and endocytosis.

As shown in Figure 8-14, nascent synaptic vesicles are produced in the neuronal cell body by a process similar to that in the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35). The membrane proteins of synaptic vesicles are synthesized in the
rough endoplasmic reticulum and are then directed to the Golgi network, where processing, maturation, and sorting occur. Nascent synaptic vesicles-which are, in fact, secretory vesicles-are then transported to the nerve terminal by fast axonal transport (see p. 25) mediated by the microtubule system, which also carries mitochondria to the terminal.

Vesicles destined to contain peptide neurotransmitters travel down the axon with the presynthesized peptides or peptide precursors already inside. On arrival at the nerve terminal (see Fig. 8-14), the vesicles-now called dense-core secretory granules ( 100 to 200 nm in diameter)-become randomly distributed in the cytoplasm of the terminal (see p. 310).

Vesicles destined to contain nonpeptide neurotransmitters (e.g., ACh) travel down the axon with no transmitter inside.

![bo2264543376c](bo2264543376c.jpg)

Figure 8-14 Synthesis and recycling of synaptic vesicles and their content.

On arrival at the nerve terminal (see Fig. 8-14), the vesicles take up the nonpeptide neurotransmitter, which is synthesized locally in the nerve terminal. These nonpeptide clear synaptic vesicles ( 40 to 50 nm in diameter) then attach to the actin-based cytoskeletal network. At this point, the mature clear synaptic vesicles are functionally ready for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-$ dependent transmitter release and become docked at specific release sites in the active zones of the presynaptic membrane. After exocytotic fusion of the clear synaptic vesicles, endocytosis via clathrin-coated vesicles (see pp. 40-42) recovers membrane components and recycles them to an endosome compartment in the terminal. Synaptic vesicles may then be re-formed within the terminal for reuse in neurotransmission, or they may be transported back to the cell body for turnover and degradation.

The concentrative uptake of nonpeptide neurotransmitters into clear synaptic vesicles is accomplished by the combination of a vacuolar-type H-ATPase and various neurotransmitter transport proteins (Fig. 8-15, top). The vacuolar-type $\mathbf{H}$ pump (see pp. 118-119) is a large, multisubunit complex that catalyzes the inward movement of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ into the vesicle, coupled to the hydrolysis of cytosolic ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate. The resulting pH and voltage gradients across the vesicle membrane energize the uptake of neurotransmitters into the vesicle via three families of neurotransmitter transport proteins that mediate the exchange of neurotransmitters in the cytosol for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the vesicle (see Table 5-4). The SLC18 family includes members specific for monoamines (e.g., epinephrine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, histamine) and ACh. Members of the SLC17 family transport glutamate, and the SLC32 family handles GABA and glycine.

Many proteins are involved in the fusion and recycling of synaptic vesicles (see Fig. 8-15). The SNARE proteins (see p. 37), which also participate in the secretory pathway, comprise the force-generating molecular machinery for membrane-membrane fusion. One SNARE protein-named
synaptobrevin or VAMP-is a "v" SNARE because it is in the vesicle membrane. The two other SNARE proteins-one called syntaxin-1 and the other, SNAP-25 (synaptosomeassociated protein, 25 kDa )-are "t" SNAREs because they are in the target (i.e., presynaptic) membrane. Synaptobrevin of the vesicle membrane and syntaxin-1 of the presynaptic membrane are anchored in the presynaptic membrane by single membrane-spanning segments. On the other hand, the presynaptic SNAP-25-which exists as a dual-helix bundle-is tethered to the presynaptic membrane by palmitoyl lipid chains. In the next section, we discuss how the SNAREs produce fusion.

Synaptotagmin is a synaptic vesicle protein that has, at its cytosolic end, two repetitive domains that are homologous to the C 2 domain of protein kinase C. It is the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensor for exocytosis. Rab3 is a member of a large family of low-molecular-weight GTP-binding proteins that appears to be universally involved in cellular membrane trafficking (see p. 37) via the binding and hydrolysis of GTP, and it also regulates synaptic release.

## Neurotransmitter release occurs by exocytosis of synaptic vesicles

Although the mechanism by which synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents is still not completely understood, we have working models (see Fig. 8-15) for the function of various key components and steps involved in synaptic vesicle release. These models are based on a variety of in vitro experiments. The use of specific toxins that act at nerve synapses and elegant functional studies of genetic mutants in Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, and gene knockout mice have provided important information on the role of various components.

We have already introduced key proteins located in the synaptic vesicle, including the v-SNAREs synaptobrevin and

the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensor synaptotagmin. We also have introduced the two t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25 (see p. 37) in the target area of the presynaptic membrane. These are also essential for the fusion process. As discussed below on pages 224-225, tetanus toxin and certain botulinum toxins are endoproteinases that cleave synaptobrevin, whereas other botulinum endoproteinases cleave syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25. These toxins thus block the fusion of synaptic vesicles. 7 N8-8

As summarized in Figure 8-15, after docking of the vesicle near the presynaptic membrane, Sec-1/Munc18, Munc13, and RIM catalyze assembly of the partial SNARE complex. The free helical ends of synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 begin to coil around each other to form a fourhelix bundle-the trans-SNARE complex-formed by four $\sim 70$-amino-acid SNARE helix motifs, one from synaptobrevin, one from syntaxin-1, and two from SNAP-25. The result, called priming stage 1 , is a ternary SNARE complex with an extraordinarily stable rod-shaped structure of intertwined $\alpha$ helices. As the energetically favorable coiling of the three SNAREs continues in a zipper-like process, the vesicle membrane is pulled ever closer to the presynaptic membrane. Next, a cytosolic protein called complexin inserts into the trans-SNARE complex, preventing spontaneous fusion. The result is priming stage 2.

As $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters through voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see Table 7-2)-located in register with the active zone of the presynaptic membrane-it binds to multiple sites on the C 2 domains of synaptotagmin. These $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-bound C 2 domains promote the binding of synaptotagmin to acidic phospholipids in the presynaptic membrane and also displace the complexin, thereby reversing the block to fusion. These events trigger the actual membrane fusion event, accompanied by fusion-pore opening and the beginning of transmitter release. The role of the synaptotagmin as the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensor is supported by experiments with knockout mice and Drosophila mutants showing that the absence of the appropriate isoform of this protein results in impaired $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dependent transmitter release.

Following fusion completion, as the plasma-membrane Ca-ATPase (PMCA) extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the plasma membrane and as mitochondria take up $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+},\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, rapidly falls, causing synaptotagmin to dissociate from the tightly wound SNARE complex. The soluble $\alpha$-SNAP (soluble NSF attachment protein) 9 N8-8 binds to the SNARE complex and promotes the binding of NSF ( $N$-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor, a homohexameric ATPase), which uses the energy of ATP hydrolysis to disassemble the SNAREs. The now-free synaptobrevin presumably undergoes recycling endocytosis, whereas the syntaxin and SNAP-25 on the presynaptic membrane are available for the next round of vesicle fusion.

The model just presented leaves unanswered some important questions. For example, what is the exact structure of the fusion pore detected by electrophysiological measurements as a primary event in membrane fusion? Also, precisely how do the many regulatory and scaffolding proteins control the numerous conformational changes that accompany the membrane fusion event? Physiologists are very interested in the details of synaptic vesicle fusion because regulation of the exocytotic process is a target for control of the strength of synaptic transmission and is undoubtedly involved in synaptic plasticity phenomena responsible for changes in animal behavior. For their work on vesicle trafficking, including fusion of synaptic vesicle, James Rothman, Randy Schekman, and Thomas Südhof shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2013. 9 N8-16

## Re-uptake or cleavage of the neurotransmitter terminates its action

Effective transmission across chemical synapses requires not only release of the neurotransmitter and activation of the receptor on the postsynaptic membrane but also rapid and efficient mechanisms for removal of the transmitter. At synapses where ACh is released, this removal is accomplished by enzymatic destruction of the neurotransmitter. However, the more general mechanism in the nervous system involves re-uptake of the neurotransmitter mediated by specific highaffinity transport systems located in the presynaptic plasma membrane and surrounding glial cells. These secondary active transport systems use the normal ionic gradients of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$, or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to achieve concentrative uptake of transmitter. Vertebrates have two distinct families of neurotransmitter transport proteins. The first family is characterized by a common motif of 12 membrane-spanning segments and includes transporters with specificity for catecholamines, serotonin, GABA, glycine, and choline. Energy coupling of transport in this class of systems is generally based on cotransport of the substrate with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The second family is represented by transporters for the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate; in these systems, substrate transport generally couples to cotransport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and to exchange of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

At the neuromuscular junction and other cholinergic synapses, immediate termination of the action of ACh is accomplished enzymatically by the action of AChE. Although AChE is primarily found at the neuromuscular junction, AChE activity can be detected throughout the nervous system. The enzyme occurs in a variety of physical forms. The globular or G forms exist as monomers, dimers, or tetramers of a common $\sim 72-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein catalytic subunit. These molecules can be found either in soluble form or bound to cell membranes via a GPI linkage (see p. 13) in which a post-translational modification attaches the C terminus of the protein to a glycolipid moiety. The asymmetric or $\mathbf{A}$ forms consist of one to three tetramers of the globular enzyme coupled via disulfide bond linkage to a collagen-like structural protein. The largest asymmetric form, which has 12 catalytic subunits attached to the collagen-like tail, is the major species located at the neuromuscular junction. The triple-helical, collagen-like tail attaches the asymmetric AChE complex to extracellular matrix components of the synaptic basal lamina. The various physical forms of AChE are a result of the alternative splicing that occurs in the transcription of a single AChE gene. 9 N8-9

The enzyme AChE rapidly hydrolyzes ACh to choline and acetate in a two-step process:

AChE +ACh $\underset{\rightleftarrows}{\rightleftarrows}$ acetyl-AChE $\rightarrow$ acetate +AChE choline

## N8-9 Acetylcholinesterase

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme is an ellipsoidal globular protein, approximately $4.5 \mathrm{~nm} \times 6.0 \mathrm{~nm} \times 6.5 \mathrm{~nm}$. It includes a central 12 -stranded $\beta$ sheet surrounded by 14 $\alpha$-helical segments. The active site of the enzyme is composed of three residues (Ser200, His440, and Glu327) located on different loops. These residues are analogous to the Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad of serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. This similarity is an example of convergent evolution, inasmuch as there is little structural similarity between the two types of enzymes. A unique aspect of the structure of AChE is that the active site of ACh hydrolysis is located at the bottom of a 2.0-nm-deep gorge (the active site gorge) that the substrate must enter by diffusion from the surface of the protein. The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of AChE from the electric ray, Torpedo californica, has been solved by $\times$-ray crystallography.

In the first step of the enzymatic reaction (see Equation 8-5), the H from the hydroxyl of Ser200 becomes attached to the oxygen in the ester linkage of ACh , which results in the formation of choline and a tetrahedral acyl-enzyme intermediate at Ser200.

In the second step of Equation 8-5, the hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme yields acetate and the free enzyme.

In the first step of the reaction, the enzyme cleaves choline from ACh , which results in the formation of a transient intermediate in which the acetate group is covalently coupled to a serine group on the enzyme. The second step is the hydrolysis and release of this acetate as well as the recovery of free enzyme. The nerve terminal recovers the extracellular choline via a high-affinity $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled uptake system and uses it for the synthesis of ACh (Box 8-1).

## TOXINS AND DRUGS AFFECTING SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION

Much of our knowledge of the synaptic physiology of the neuromuscular junction and the identities of its various molecular components have been derived from experiments using specific pharmacological agents and toxins that permit functional dissection of the system. Figure 8-16 illustrates the relative synaptic location and corresponding pharmacology of AChE as well as several ion channels and proteins involved in exocytosis.

## Guanidinium neurotoxins such as tetrodotoxin prevent depolarization of the nerve terminal, whereas dendrotoxins inhibit repolarization

The action potential is the first step in transmission: a nerve action potential arriving at the terminal initiates the entire process. As discussed in Chapter 7, the depolarizing phase of the action potential is mediated by voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels that are specifically blocked by nanomolar concentrations of the small guanidinium neurotoxins tetrodotoxin and saxitoxin (see Fig. 7-5C). 9 N8-11

The mamba snake toxin dendrotoxin (see p. 196) has an effect that is precisely opposite that of tetrodotoxin: it facilitates the release of ACh that is evoked by nerve stimulation. Dendrotoxins are a family of $\sim 59$-residue proteins with three disulfide bonds that block certain isoforms of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels by binding to an extracellular site in the P -region domain with high affinity. These toxins reveal the important role of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in terminating the process of transmitter release. Blockade of presynaptic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels by dendrotoxin inhibits repolarization of the presynaptic membrane, thereby

# N8-11 Blockade of Muscle $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

An action potential is not only the first but also the last step in transmission at the neuromuscular junction: the production of an action potential in the muscle fiber membrane signals the successful completion of synaptic transmission. As discussed above, action potentials, including those in muscle, can be blocked by TTX and STX. Selective blockade of the muscle action potential can be achieved with a unique toxin called $\mu$-conotoxin (see p. 187), (1) N7-14 which is obtained from a marine snail (Conus geographus). $\mu$-conotoxin is a 22-residue, basic peptide with a discoidal, star-like threedimensional structure that is stabilized by three disulfide bonds. It is an especially potent blocker of the particular Nav1.4 isoform of the voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel that is present in adult mammalian skeletal muscle, but it has little effect on the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel isoforms of nerve or heart. If an intact nerve-muscle preparation is exposed to $\mu$-conotoxin, stimulation of the nerve still evokes the release of ACh , but the muscle action potential is completely eliminated.

# BOX 8-1 Diseases of Neuromuscular Transmission 

The term myasthenia means muscle weakness (from the Greek mys + asthenia) and is generally used clinically to denote weakness in the absence of a CNS disorder, neuropathy, or primary muscle disease. Thus, myasthenia can be due to any one of a wide range of aberrations of neuromuscular transmission.

## Myasthenia Gravis

Myasthenia gravis, one specific type of myasthenia and the most common adult form, affects 25 to 125 of every 1 million people. It can occur at any age but has a bimodal distribution, with peak incidences occurring among people in their 20s and 60s. Those affected at an early age tend to be women with hyperplasia of the thymus. Those who are older are more likely to be men with coexisting cancer of the thymus gland. The cells of the thymus possess nicotinic AChRs, and the disease arises as a result of antibodies directed against these receptors. The antibodies then lead to skeletal muscle weakness caused in part by competitive antagonism of AChRs. Symptoms include fatigue and weakness of skeletal muscle. Two major forms of the disease are recognized: one that involves weakness of only the extraocular muscles and another that results in generalized weakness of all skeletal muscles. In either case, myasthenia gravis is typified by fluctuating symptoms, with weakness greatest toward the end of the day or after exertion. In severe cases, paralysis of the respiratory muscles can lead to death. Treatment directed at enhancing cholinergic transmission, alone or combined with thymectomy or immunosuppression, is highly effective in most patients.

Progress toward achieving an understanding of the cause of myasthenia gravis was first made when electrophysiological analysis of involved muscle revealed that the amplitude of the MEPP was decreased, although the frequency of quantal events was normal. This finding suggested either a defect in the postsynaptic response to ACh or a reduced concentration of ACh in the synaptic vesicles. A major breakthrough occurred in 1973, when Patrick and Lindstrom found that symptoms similar to those of humans with myasthenia developed in rabbits immunized with AChR protein purified from the electric eel. This finding was shortly followed by the demonstration of anti-AChR antibodies in human patients with myasthenia gravis and a severe reduction in the surface density of AChR in the junctional folds. The anti-AChR antibodies are directed against one or more subunits of the receptor, where they bind and activate complement and accelerate destruction of the receptors. The most common target of these antibodies is a region of the AChR $\alpha$ subunit called MIR (main immunogenic region).

Myasthenia gravis is now recognized to be an acquired autoimmune disorder in which the spontaneous production of antiAChR antibodies results in progressive loss of muscle AChRs and degeneration of postjunctional folds. Treatment is aimed at either reducing the potency of the immunological attack or enhancing cholinergic activity within the synapse. Reduction of the potency of the immunological attack is achieved by the use of immunosuppressants (most commonly corticosteroids) or plasmapheresis (removal of antibodies from the patient's serum). Some patients with myasthenia gravis have a thymoma (a tumor of the thymus gland) that is often readily seen on routine chest
radiographs. In these patients, removal of the thymoma leads to clinical improvement in nearly $75 \%$ of the cases. Enhancement of cholinergic activity is achieved via the use of AChE inhibitors; pyridostigmine is the most widely used agent. The dosage of these drugs must be carefully monitored to prevent overexposure of the remaining AChRs to ACh. Overexposure can lead to overstimulation of the postsynaptic receptors, prolonged depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane, inactivation of neighboring $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, and thus synaptic blockade.

## Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome

Congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS) refers to a variety of inherited disorders, present at birth, that affect neuromuscular transmission in a variety of ways. Because specific cases can involve abnormal presynaptic release of ACh, AChE deficiency, or defective AChR function (without the presence of antireceptor antibodies), the signs and symptoms can also vary widely.

In 1995, an unusual example of a CMS disorder was traced to a mutation in the $\varepsilon$ subunit of the human AChR. Single channel recordings from biopsy samples of muscle fibers of a young myasthenic patient revealed a profound alteration in AChR kinetics. The burst duration of AChR openings was greatly prolonged in comparison with that of normal human AChR channels. The patient had a mutation of threonine to proline at position 264 in the adult $\varepsilon$ subunit of the AChR. This amino-acid residue corresponds to an evolutionarily conserved position in the M2 membrane-spanning segment, which is involved in formation of the channel pore. Thus, a human mutation in the pore region of the AChR protein results in failure of the channel to close normally, thereby causing excessive depolarization and pathological consequences at the muscle end plate.

Many human mutations in $\alpha, \beta, \delta, \varepsilon$, and $\gamma$ subunits of the nicotinic muscle AChR have since been characterized. These mutations have many different effects on AChR kinetics including slow and fast channel syndromes depending on where they occur in the receptor channel protein.

## Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome

Another condition characterized by progressive muscle weakness and fatigue is Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS; also called Lambert-Eaton syndrome), an impairment of presynaptic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels at motor nerve terminals. LEMS is an autoimmune disorder, most often seen in patients with certain types of cancer, such as small-cell lung carcinoma. In LEMS, antibodies attack Cav2.2 (CACNA1B), which reduces $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry during the presynaptic action potential and thus reduces ACh release. LEMS differs from myasthenia gravis as follows: (1) LEMS primarily attacks the limb muscles, not the ocular and bulbar muscles. (2) In LEMS, repetitive stimulation of a particular muscle (which leads to a progressive rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ causes a gradual increase in the amplitude of the compound motor action potential (CMAP) in the stimulated muscle-as measured using electromyography (EMG) (1) N8-10. In patients with myasthenia, repetitive stimulation leads to progressive lessening of the CMAP. Thus, repeated muscle stimulation leads to increasing contractile strength in patients with LEMS and to decreasing strength in patients with myasthenia.

A compound motor action potential (CMAP) is the summation of many nearly simultaneous action potentials from many skeletal muscle fibers that are in the same vicinity. One would typically observe CMAPs during electromyography.

## $\omega$-Conotoxin blocks $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx into nerve terminals, inhibiting synaptic transmission

The exocytotic fusion of mature synaptic vesicles positioned at presynaptic active zones and the subsequent release of ACh require the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the nerve terminal. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the presynaptic terminal through voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that are activated by the depolarization of an incoming action potential. One type of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel, the N-type isoform, has been localized to the region of the active zone of the frog neuromuscular junction. Voltage-clamp experiments demonstrate that a class of molluscan peptide toxins called $\omega$-conotoxins (see p. 193) block N-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents in a virtually irreversible fashion. Exposure of a frog nerve-muscle preparation to $\omega$-conotoxin thus inhibits the release of neurotransmitter. This effect is manifested as an abolition of muscle EPP when the preparation is stimulated via the nerve. The $\omega$-conotoxins are 24 to 29 residues long and contain three disulfide bonds. Imaging with confocal laser scanning microscopy has shown that $\omega$-conotoxin binds at highest density to voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the presynaptic nerve terminal, directly across the synaptic cleft from AChR channels. This observation implies that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are located precisely at the active zones of synaptic vesicle fusion. This arrangement provides for focal entry and short-range diffusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entering the nerve terminal to the exact sites involved in promoting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent transmitter release.

## Bacterial toxins such as tetanus and botulinum toxins

cleave proteins involved in exocytosis, preventing fusion of synaptic vesicles
Another class of neurotoxins that specifically inhibits neurotransmitter release includes the tetanus and botulinum toxins. These large-protein toxins ( $\sim 150 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) are respectively produced by the bacteria Clostridium tetani and Clostridium botulinum (Box 8-2). C. tetani is the causative agent of tetanus (lockjaw), which is characterized by a general increase in muscle tension and muscle rigidity, beginning most often with the muscles of mastication. The reason for this paradoxical enhancement of muscle action is that the greatest effect of these toxins is to inhibit synaptic transmission by inhibitory neurons in the spinal cord, neurons that would normally inhibit muscle contraction. The result is hyperstimulation of skeletal muscle contraction. C. botulinum causes botulism, which is characterized by weakness and paralysis of skeletal muscle as well as by a variety of symptoms that are related to inhibition of cholinergic nerve endings in the autonomic nervous system.

In humans, infection by these bacteria can lead to death because the toxins that they synthesize are potent inhibitors of neurotransmitter release. This inhibition occurs because both tetanus and botulinum toxin proteins have zincdependent endoproteinase activity (Table 8-2). These toxins enter nerve terminals and specifically cleave three different

## BOX 8-2 Clostridial Catastrophes

## Botulism

Although hardly one of the most common causes of food poisoning today, botulism is still the example that many people cite when food-borne illnesses are discussed. The neurotoxin of Clostridium botulinum is considered the most toxic natural substance known. The median lethal dose is $\sim 1 \mathrm{ng}$ of toxin per kilogram of human body weight by intravenous exposure and 3 -fold higher for inhalation exposure. The uptake into a presynaptic terminal of one molecule-with its cleavage of SNAREs-is theoretically sufficient to eliminate vesicle exocytosis in that terminal. The most common source of botulism is homemade foods. The spores of this organism can survive boiling temperatures for a number of hours, and if the cooked food is allowed to stand at room temperature for $>16$ hours, the clostridial spores can germinate and produce toxin. However, the toxin itself is readily denatured by prolonged heating at $>60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

Symptoms of the illness may appear several hours to more than a week after ingestion, although most cases occur within 18 to 36 hours. Patients begin to complain of symptoms attributable to inhibition of synaptic vesicle release in the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 14), such as dry mouth, double vision, and difficulty in swallowing and speaking, and later begin to experience gastrointestinal complications, including vomiting, pain, and diarrhea. Symptoms attributable to inhibition of synaptic vesicle release at the neuromuscular junction, such as weakness and paralysis of the limbs, may soon follow; ultimately, paralysis of the respiratory muscles (see pp. 606-607) can be fatal. Prompt intervention with mechanical ventilation has reduced the mortality from botulism dramatically, and the figure today stands at about $20 \%$. Almost all deaths occur among the first victims ingesting a contaminated food sample because the disease is not quickly recognized; those who fall victim later, when the diagnosis is much easier, do much better. Botulinum antitoxin formulated from equine antibodies is also available for acute treatment.

## Tetanus

The disease tetanus is caused by a neurotoxin (tetanospasmin) produced by Clostridium tetani. The organism gains entry to its host via a cut or puncture wound. The toxin then travels along the peripheral nerves to the spinal cord, the major site of its attack. There, the toxin inhibits synaptic vesicle release by GABA and glycine interneurons (see p. 319) which normally inhibit firing of the motor neurons that, in turn, activate skeletal muscle. Thus, because the toxin suppresses inhibition of the normal reflex arc, muscle contraction leads to profound spasms, most characteristically of the jaw muscles but potentially affecting any muscle in the body. Symptoms can commence on the day of the injury or as long as 2 months later. Complications include respiratory arrest, aspiration pneumonia, rib fractures caused by the severe spasms, and a host of other pulmonary and cardiac manifestations.

Most people in the United States are protected from tetanus by childhood immunization with the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine. N8-12 Vaccination has reduced the number of cases of tetanus reported in the United States to only about 100 each year, almost all occurring in inadequately vaccinated individuals.

Most people in the United States are protected from tetanus by childhood immunization with the DPT (diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus) vaccine. However in recent years fear of side effects and rare allergic reactions has led some parents to reject DPT vaccination. Unvaccinated children may be at greater risk of these easily preventable diseases, whereas the risk of vaccination side effects is small in comparison.

SNARE proteins required for synaptic vesicle exocytosis. Tetanus toxin and botulinum toxins B, D, F, and G cleave the v-SNARE synaptobrevin (see p. 219), an integral membrane protein of the synaptic vesicle membrane. Botulinum toxins A and E cleave SNAP-25, whereas botulinum toxin C1 cleaves the t-SNAREs syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25.

These neurotoxins also have useful medical and cosmetic applications. For example, botulinum toxin is used to treat certain disorders characterized by muscle spasms and dystonias involving neurological movement disorders. Injection of a small amount of botulinum toxin into the eye muscles

Since its approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2002 for cosmetic applications, a commercial preparation of botulinum toxin known as Botox has been widely used for removal of frown lines and facial wrinkles. Local injections of Botox smooth wrinkles by paralysis of facial muscles, although care must be taken to prevent effects of the toxin away from the intended site. The benefits of such treatments may last for 3 to 6 months before regeneration of nerve terminals reinnervates the muscles causing the wrinkles.

## Both agonists and antagonists of the nicotinic AChR can prevent synaptic transmission

The ionotropic (nicotinic) AChR channel located in the postsynaptic muscle membrane also has a rich and diverse pharmacology (see Fig. 8-16) that can be exploited for clinical applications as well as for elucidation of many functional aspects of the neuromuscular junction. Figure 8-17 shows

the chemical structures of two classes of agents that act on the nicotinic AChR. These agents are classified as agonists or antagonists according to whether they activate opening of the channel or prevent its activation. Many agonists have a structure similar to that of the natural neurotransmitter ACh. In general, such agonists activate the opening of AChR channels with the same unitary conductance as those activated by ACh, but with different kinetics of channel opening and closing. The synthetic drugs carbamylcholine (or carbachol) and succinylcholine contain the choline moiety of ACh that is required for receptor activation. Carbamylcholine is a carbamyl ester of choline; succinylcholine (or succinyldicholine) is a dimer of ACh molecules linked together via the acetyl methyl group. Both of these agents are resistant to hydrolysis by muscle AChE, but succinylcholine is susceptible to hydrolysis by plasma and liver esterases. This property allows prolonged activation of AChRs.

Succinylcholine is used to produce sustained muscle relaxation or "flaccid paralysis," which is useful in certain types of surgery and procedures such as tracheal intubation, in which it is important to prevent excitation and contraction of skeletal muscles. This paralytic action occurs because succinylcholine prolongs the opening of AChR channels and thereby depolarizes the muscle membrane in the vicinity of the end plate. Such depolarization results in initial repetitive muscle excitation and tremors, followed by relaxation secondary to inactivation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the vicinity of the end plate. This effect prevents the spread of muscle action potentials beyond the end-plate region. On a longer time scale, such agents also lead to desensitization of the AChR to agonist, which further inhibits neuromuscular transmission.

Another important agonist acting on AChRs is nicotine, which we discussed on pages 212-213. A classic example of a nicotinic AChR antagonist is $d$-tubocurarine (see Fig. 8-17), the active ingredient of curare, a poison extracted from plants of the genus Strychnos. The indigenous tribes of the Amazon region used curare to poison arrows for hunting. $d$-Tubocurarine (T) N8-2 is a competitive inhibitor of ACh binding to two activation sites on the $\alpha$ subunits of the AChR. This action leads to a nondepolarizing flaccid paralysis of skeletal muscle from inhibition of the nicotinic AChR, in contrast to the depolarizing flaccid paralysis produced by activating agonists such as succinylcholine. A hallmark of the action of $d$-tubocurarine is that it can be reversed by an increase in concentration of the natural agonist ACh by binding competition. Such reversal can be achieved by a large increase in local ACh concentration, which can be produced indirectly by an inhibitor of AChE such as neostigmine (see p. 226).

Figure 8-17 also shows the structure of pancuronium, which is a synthetic bis-quaternary ammonium steroid derivative. This drug is also useful for the production of neuromuscular blockade in surgery, and it is actually a more potent, selective competitive antagonist of the muscle nicotinic AChR than $d$-tubocurarine is.

Another class of nicotinic AChR inhibitors is a family of $\sim 8-\mathrm{kDa}$ proteins present in the venom of Elapidae snakes (e.g., cobras). These toxins include $\alpha$-bungarotoxin ( $\alpha-\mathrm{Bgt}$ )
and homologous $\alpha$ toxins, which bind very strongly to nicotinic receptors. The specific binding of $\alpha-\mathrm{Bgt}$ to the nicotinic AChR of skeletal muscle is virtually irreversible. When $\alpha$-Bgt binds to the nicotinic AChR, it obstructs the agonist binding site and prevents activation of the receptor by ACh. The radioiodinated derivative ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}$-labeled $\alpha$-Bgt has been widely used as a ligand for purifying the nicotinic AChR from various tissues. Fluorescent derivatives of $\alpha$-Bgt can also be used as specific labels for localizing AChRs at the muscle end plate. The same snake venom (from Bungarus multicinctus) that contains $\alpha$-Bgt also contains a homologous protein toxin called $\kappa$-bungarotoxin ( $\kappa$-Bgt). This toxin has little effect on nicotinic AChR channels at the neuromuscular junction, but it does inhibit AChR channels in neuronal tissue. The differential effect of $\alpha$-Bgt and $\kappa$-Bgt on muscle and neuronal currents activated by both ACh and nicotine originally led to the recognition that pharmacologically distinct classes of nicotinic receptors exist in the CNS and in skeletal muscle. As we know today, the basis for these classes is the differential expression of multiple genes encoding various nicotinic AChR subunits (see p. 213).

## Inhibitors of AChE prolong and magnify the EPP

A variety of inhibitors of anticholinesterase have been invaluable in defining the contribution of AChE to responses at the muscle end plate. Inhibition of AChE generally increases the amplitude and prolongs the duration of the postsynaptic response to ACh; thus, the enzyme plays an important role in limiting the excitatory action of ACh under normal physiological conditions. In the absence of ACh breakdown by AChE , the prolonged decay of the EPP reflects the underlying kinetics of activated receptors and slow depletion of the agonist in the vicinity of the junctional folds by diffusion of ACh.

The plant alkaloid physostigmine (also known as eserine) is the prototypic anticholinesterase (Fig. 8-18). Neostigmine (Prostigmin ${ }^{\star}$ ), a synthetic anti-AChE drug with chemical similarity to physostigmine, is used to treat myasthenia gravis (see Box 8-1). Both of these inhibitorswhose ester moieties resemble that of ACh-are slowly reversible. As shown in Equation 8-5, when AChE reacts with its normal substrate (i.e., ACh), the resulting intermediate (i.e., acetyl-AChE) undergoes rapid hydrolysis to recycle AChE for its next round of catalysis. Reaction with physostigmine or neostigmine, however, produces a carbamylated form of AChE that undergoes hydrolysis at an extremely low rate, which eventually results in the release of the active enzyme. This slow hydrolysis explains why the effective half-lives of the drugs are on the order of several hours in humans.

Another important class of synthetic AChE inhibitors consists of organophosphorus compounds, which are irreversible inhibitors. These inhibitors are typified by diisopropyl fluorophosphate (DFP; see Fig. 8-18). Such compounds react with the serine residue of AChE (see pp. 212-213) and form an essentially irreversible covalent modification of the enzyme. Such agents rank high among the most potent and lethal of toxic chemicals. Their devastating effect is due to

For example, exposure to toxic organophosphorus agents results in the flaccid paralysis of respiratory muscles because of initial muscle stimulation followed by depolarization blockade. (○) N8-13 The lethality of these compounds dramatically underlines the essential role of AChE in terminating cholinergic neurotransmission. Chemical warfare agents (i.e., "nerve gas," such as sarin) are deadly, volatile forms of these compounds. Related compounds, such as malathion (see Fig. 8-18), which are relatively selective for insects, are widely used as agricultural insecticides.

A natural organophosphorus neurotoxin is produced by Anabaena flos-aquae, a toxic cyanobacterium (blue-green alga). Known as anatoxin-a(s), this toxin is a potent inhibitor of AChE and is responsible for the poisoning of dogs and farm animals that drink from contaminated ponds. Another unusual class of natural inhibitors includes the fasciculins, a family of small-protein toxins present in mamba snake venom that inhibit AChE with very high affinity and specificity.

AChE inhibitors lead to an accumulation of ACh in the synaptic cleft, causing a sustained activation of the nicotinic AChR and thus a sustained depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane. Although the initial depolarization would lead to an action potential and muscle contraction, the sustained depolarization would prevent voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels from recovering from inactivation. The result is a flaccid muscle paralysis.

# CELLULAR PHYSIOLOGY OF SKELETAL, CARDIAC, AND SMOOTH MUSCLE 

Edward G. Moczydlowski

The primary function of muscle is to generate force or movement in response to a physiological stimulus. The human body contains three fundamentally different types of muscle adapted to specialized functions. Skeletal muscle is responsible for the voluntary movement of bones that underlies locomotion and work production. Skeletal muscle also controls the breathing cycle of the lungs via contraction of the diaphragm and functions as a pump assisting return of the venous blood supply to the heart. Cardiac muscle is specific to the heart as the biomechanical pump driving the delivery of blood to the lungs and tissues. Smooth muscle provides mechanical control of organ systems such as the digestive, urinary, and reproductive tracts as well as the blood vessels of the circulatory system and the airway passages of the respiratory system.

Contraction of muscles is initiated either by a chemical neurotransmitter or paracrine factor or by direct electrical excitation. All muscles transduce chemical energy released by hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical work. The unique physiological role of each of the three basic muscle types dictates inherent differences in the rate and duration of contraction, metabolism, fatigability, and ability to regulate contractile strength. For example, both skeletal and cardiac muscle must be capable of rapid force development and shortening. However, skeletal muscle must be able to maintain contractile force for relatively long periods. Cardiac muscle contracts only briefly with each heartbeat but must sustain this rhythmic activity for a lifetime. Smooth muscle, like skeletal muscle, must be able to regulate contraction over a wide range of force development and elastic changes in the size of organs such as the urinary bladder and uterus. In some tissues (e.g., sphincters), smooth muscle sustains contraction without fatigue for very long periods. Despite these differences, the trigger for muscle contraction is the same for all three types of muscle: a rise in the free cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}\right)$.

This chapter describes the fundamental physiology of muscle excitation, the coupling of excitation to contraction, the molecular mechanism of contraction, the regulation of contraction, and the related issues of muscle diversity. We describe general molecular mechanisms shared by all muscle cells and contrast the unique features of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle. Because molecular mechanisms specific to cardiac myocytes are best understood in the unique context
of the heart as a pump, we discuss details of cardiac muscle physiology at greater depth in Chapters 22.

## SKELETAL MUSCLE

## Contraction of skeletal muscle is initiated by motor neurons that innervate motor units

The smallest contractile unit of skeletal muscle is a multinucleated, elongated cell called a muscle fiber or myofiber (Fig. 9-1). A bundle of linearly aligned muscle fibers forms a fascicle. In turn, bundles of fascicles form a muscle, such as the biceps. The whole muscle is contained within an external sheath extending from the tendons called the epimysium. Fascicles within the muscle are enveloped by a sheath called the perimysium. Single muscle fibers within individual fascicles are surrounded by a sheath called the endomysium. The highly organized architecture of skeletal muscle fibers and connective tissue allows skeletal muscle to generate considerable mechanical force in a vectorial manner. Beneath the endomysium surrounding each muscle fiber is the plasma membrane of the muscle cell called the sarcolemma. An individual skeletal muscle cell contains a densely arranged parallel array of cylindrical elements called myofibrils. Each myofibril is essentially an end-to-end chain of regular repeating units-or sarcomeres-that consist of smaller interdigitating filaments called myofilaments; these myofilaments contain both thin filaments and thick filaments (see pp. 25-28).

All skeletal muscle is under voluntary or reflex control by motor neurons of the somatic motor system. Somatic motor neurons are efferent neurons with cell bodies located in the central nervous system (CNS). A single muscle cell responds to only a single motor neuron whose cell body-except for cranial nerves-resides in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. However, the axon of a motor neuron typically branches near its termination to innervate a few or many individual muscle cells. The group of muscle fibers innervated by all of the collateral branches of a single motor neuron is referred to as a motor unit. A whole muscle can produce a wide range of forces and a graded range of shortening by varying the number of motor units excited within the muscle. The innervation ratio of a whole skeletal muscle is defined as the number of muscle fibers innervated by a single motor

Figure 9-1 Structure of skeletal muscle, from muscle to myofilament.
neuron. Muscles with a small innervation ratio control fine movements involving small forces. For example, fine, highprecision movements of the extraocular muscles that control positioning movements of the eye are achieved via an innervation ratio of as little as $\sim 3$ muscle fibers per neuron. Conversely, muscles with a large innervation ratio control coarse movement requiring development of large forces. Postural control by the soleus muscle uses an innervation ratio of $\sim 200$. The gastrocnemius muscle, which is capable of developing large forces required in athletic activities such as jumping, has innervation ratios that vary from $\sim 100$ to $\sim 1000$.

As discussed on pp. 208-210, a motor nerve axon contacts each muscle fiber near the middle of the fiber to form a synapse called the neuromuscular junction. The specialized region of sarcolemma in closest contact with the presynaptic nerve terminal is called the motor end plate. Although skeletal muscle fibers can be artificially excited by direct electrical stimulation, physiological excitation of skeletal muscle always involves chemical activation by release of acetylcholine ( ACh ) from the motor nerve terminal. Binding of ACh to the nicotinic receptor gives rise to a graded, depolarizing end-plate potential. An end-plate potential of sufficient magnitude raises the membrane potential to the firing
threshold and activates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (Navs) in the vicinity of the end plate, triggering an action potential that propagates along the surface membrane.

## Action potentials propagate from the sarcolemma to the interior of muscle fibers along the transverse tubule network

As action potentials propagate along the surface membrane of skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers, they penetrate into the cell interior via radially oriented, tubular invaginations of the plasma membrane called transverse tubules or T tubules (Fig. 9-2). T tubules plunge into the muscle fiber and surround the myofibrils at two points in each sarcomere: at the junctions of the A and the I bands. A cross section through the A-I junction shows a complex branching array of T tubules penetrating to the center of the muscle cell and surrounding the individual myofibrils. Along its length the tubule associates with two terminal cisternae, which are specialized regions of the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). The SR of muscle cells is a specialized version of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of noncontractile cells and serves as a storage organelle for intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The combination of the T-tubule membrane and its two neighboring cisternae is called a triad junction, or simply a triad. (○) N9-1

## Depolarization of the T-tubule membrane results in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR at the triad

The ultimate intracellular signal that triggers and sustains contraction of skeletal muscle cells is a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can enter the cytoplasm from the extracellular space through voltage-gated ion channels or, alternatively, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be released into the cytoplasm from the intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ storage reservoir of the SR. Thus, both extracellular and intracellular sources may contribute to the increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The process by which electrical "excitation" of the surface membrane triggers an increase of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in muscle is known as excitation-contraction coupling or EC coupling.

The propagation of the action potential into the T tubules of the myofiber depolarizes the triad region of the T tubules, as discussed in the previous section, thereby activating L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 190-193). These voltage-gated channels cluster in groups of four called tetrads (Fig. 9-3) and have a pivotal role as the voltage sensor EC coupling. Functional complexes of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels contain the $\alpha_{1}$-subunit of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (i.e., Cav1.1) as well as the accessory $\alpha_{2}-\delta, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits (see Fig. 7-12B). The L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel is also often referred to as the DHP receptor because it is inhibited by a class of antihypertensive and antiarrhythmic drugs known as dihydropyridines or calcium channel blockers. Depolarization of the T-tubule membrane produces conformational changes in each of the four Cav1.1 channels of the tetrad, resulting in two major effects. First, the conformational changes open the Cav1.1 channel pore, which allows electrodiffusive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. Second, and more importantly in skeletal muscle, the voltage-driven conformational changes in the four Cav1.1 channels mechanically activate each of the four directly coupled subunits of another channel-the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release

The process by which electrical "excitation" of the surface membrane triggers an increase of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in muscle is known as excitation-contraction coupling or EC coupling.

## Membrane Invaginations ... Bringing the Depolarization into the Cell Skeletal Muscle

The combination of the T-tubule membrane and its two neighboring cisternae is called a triad or triad junction; this structure plays a crucial role in the coupling of excitation to contraction in skeletal muscle.

## Cardiac Muscle

Cardiac myocytes have a T-tubule network similar to that of skeletal muscle myofibers except that a single terminal cisterna of the SR forms a dyad junction with the T-tubule rather than a triad junction. Furthermore, T-tubules of cardiac myocytes are located at the $Z$ lines separating sarcomeres rather than at the A-I band junctions.

## Smooth Muscle

Smooth muscle, in contrast, has more rudimentary and shallow invaginations of the plasma membrane called caveolae (see Fig. 9-15). Caveolae are considered to be a special form of membrane microdomain called lipid rafts that are enriched in glycosphingolipids and cholesterol and are involved in signal transduction. A peripheral SR compartment of smooth muscle encircles the plasma membrane in close proximity to the caveolae. A larger network of central SR runs along the long axis of the cell. The peripheral SR is involved in local $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and interaction with plasma membrane ion channels that mediate electrical excitability, whereas the central SR has a greater role in delivering $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to intracellular myofilaments for contraction.

## Source of Calcium

Although the ultimate intracellular signal that triggers and sustains contraction of skeletal, cardiac, or smooth-muscle cells is a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, the three types of muscle cells differ substantially in the detailed mechanism by which a depolarization of the sarcolemmal membrane results in a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can enter the cytoplasm from the extracellular space through voltage-gated ion channels, or alternatively, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be released into the cytoplasm from the intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ storage reservoir of the SR. Thus, both
extracellular and intracellular sources may contribute to the increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. However, the relative importance of these two sources of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ varies among the different muscle types.

## Skeletal Muscle

In skeletal muscle, as noted in the text, the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel (also known as the DHP receptor) in the T tubule directly couples to the SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel (also known as the ryanodine receptor, RYR1), which leads to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR and thus a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$.

## Cardiac and Smooth Muscle

In contrast to skeletal muscle, in heart and smooth muscle, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx via the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel Cav1.2 directly activates an RYR2 isoform, leading to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR and raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. This mechanism of EC coupling known as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (CICR) is quite different from the mechanical coupling mechanism of skeletal muscle. In heart and smooth muscle, colocalization of plasma membrane Cav channels with intracellular SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels allows for close coupling of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry from the plasma membrane and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activation of RYR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels. In the CICR coupling mechanism, the action of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can be considered as analogous to that of a neurotransmitter or chemical messenger that diffuses across a synapse to activate an agonist-gated channel, but in this case the synapse is the intracellular diffusion gap of $\sim 15 \mathrm{~nm}$ between surface Cav channels and intracellular RYR channels on the SR membrane. The CICR mechanism serves as a robust amplification system whereby local influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from small clusters of L-type Cav channels in the plasma membrane trigger the coordinated release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the activation signal for myofilament contraction, from high-capacity internal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores of the SR.

In smooth muscle but not in cardiac muscle, other $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated ion channels (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels) also participate in repolarization and regulation of contractile tone. Activation of smooth-muscle contraction also often involves the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R}\right)$, another $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channel of the ER/SR membrane. In many smooth muscles, a variety of receptor agonists and chemical mediators are coupled to activation of phospholipase C (PLC). PLC activation results in cleavage of $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$ (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate) and production of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, a chemical messenger that activates $\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R}$ mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see p. 60).

channel located in the portion of the terminal cisternae of the SR membrane that faces the T tubule (see Fig. 9-3).

The SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel (see Fig. 6-20W) has a homotetrameric structure quite different from that of the T-tubule Cav1.1 channel. This SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel is also known as the ryanodine receptor (RYR) because it is inhibited by the plant alkaloid ryanodine-an important tool in characterizing RYRs. In contrast, another plant alkaloid, caffeine, which is present in coffee, activates RYRs by increasing opening probability. N9-2 RYRs are the largest known channel proteins, with a molecular mass of $\sim 550 \mathrm{kDa}$ for the monomer, or $\sim 2.1 \mathrm{MDa}$ for a homotetramer. Each of the four subunits of these channels has a large extension-also known as a foot-that projects into the cytosol (see Fig. 9-3).

In skeletal muscle, where the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels are of the RYR1 subtype, RYR1 tetramers line up in two rows in the SR membrane. In the T-tubule membrane, half as many Cav1.1 channel tetrads are similarly aligned but are spaced such that they make intracellular contact with every other RYR1 in an alternating "double checkerboard" pattern. The monomer foot domain of each of the four RYR1 subunits is complementary to the cytoplasmic projection of one of the four Cav1.1 channels in a tetrad on the T tubule (see Fig. 9-3). The precise geometrical proximity of these two proteins as well as the ability of both DHP and ryanodine to block muscle contraction indicates that mechanical interactions between these two different $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels underlie EC coupling in skeletal muscle. Further evidence for a direct physical interaction between Cav1.1 and RYR1 is the observation that many cycles of excitation and contraction can occur in complete absence of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Moreover, Cav1.1
channels in the closed state physically inhibit the opening of RYR1 channels and thereby prevent the spontaneous release of $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the nonactivated, resting state. Thus, EC coupling in skeletal muscle is an electromechanical process involving a voltage-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release mechanism.

After depolarization of the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel on the T-tubule membrane and mechanical activation of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channel in the SR, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stored in the SR rapidly leaves through the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel. When imaged using a fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ indicator, the rapid and transient rise in local $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$,-from clusters of RYR channels-appears as a spark. N9-3 This increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, activates troponin C , initiating formation of cross-bridges between myofilaments, as described below. EC coupling in skeletal muscle thus includes the entire process we have just described, beginning with the depolarization of the T-tubule membrane to the initiation of the cross-bridge cycle of contraction.

Although we have stressed that EC coupling in skeletal muscle primarily involves direct mechanical coupling between the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel in the T-tubule membrane and the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel of the SR, (5) N9-1 other mechanisms modulate the activity of RYR1. For example, RYR1 is subject to regulation by cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, ATP, and calmodulin (CaM) as well as protein kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA; see p. 57) and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII; see p. 60). In the fight-or-flight response (see p. 347), the sympathetic autonomic nervous system activates $\beta$-adrenergic receptors, causing PKA-mediated phosphorylation of RYR1 and other muscle proteins; this results in faster and larger increases in cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and thus stronger skeletal muscle contraction (Box 9-1).

# N9-2 Caffeine 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

As noted on page 230 of the text, the plant alkaloid caffeine, which is present in coffee, activates RYRs by increasing opening probability. Caffeine is often used experimentally as a research tool to open RYRs and deplete $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores in muscle, but this effect is not related to the potent CNS stimulant effects of caffeine, which are the result of its action as an antagonist of CNS adenosine receptors (see Fig 13-14B).

## N9-3 Calcium Sparks

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The use of advanced fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ indicator dyes and confocal microscopy to image $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling in muscle cells has revealed a variety of elementary events observed as brief bursts of fluorescence corresponding to a transient and highly localized increase in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Detailed biophysical studies of these events, termed $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$ sparks, has helped to refine understanding of EC coupling in skeletal, cardiac, and smoothmuscle cells.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks were first characterized in cardiac myocytes and later also described in smooth muscle and skeletal muscle. Such spark events can be observed in resting cardiac myocytes loaded with a fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dye indicator such as fluo-3 (eFig. 9-1.4). The spark is a brief increase in fluorescence intensity corresponding to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding to the dye resulting from a local and rapid increase in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration that rises to a peak within $\sim 10 \mathrm{~ms}$ and decays within $\sim 50 \mathrm{~ms}$ (see eFig. 9-1.0). Such spontaneous sparks in cardiac myocytes are due to the small opening probability of SR RYR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels that depends upon $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in the cytoplasm and SR lumen. Biophysical analysis indicates that a single spark event corresponds to the simultaneous opening of a cluster of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels, termed calcium release units (CRUs), that may represent the opening of $\sim 10$ to 100 RYR channels, depending on the recording conditions and preparation. Although visual resolution of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks generally requires low activation conditions of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release, they can be observed in single cardiac myocytes activated by a depolarizing
voltage pulse at the leading edge of a transient rise of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, (see eFig. 9-1.4).
eFigure 9-1C shows a series of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks from a cardiac myocyte imaged by a line scan of a confocal microscope oriented along the long axis of the cell. The recording shows that synchronized voltage-activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks appear at the locations of $T$ tubules at a spacing of $\sim 1.8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ apart. Such experiments have shown that the macroscopic or global increase in cytoplasmic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in muscle cells is the result of the stochastic summation of many individual spark events corresponding to localized bursts of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. Studies of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks have also confirmed that voltage-activated mechanical coupling underlies EC mechanisms in skeletal muscle, whereas $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release underlies these mechanisms in cardiac and smooth muscle.

Due to the tight voltage control of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and termination by brief $\sim 2-\mathrm{ms} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$action potentials in mammalian skeletal muscle, classical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks in these striated muscle cells can be resolved only after strenuous exercise of the muscle and under certain nonphysiological and pathological conditions. This implies that spontaneous opening of RYRs in skeletal muscle is suppressed by mechanical linkage to Cav channels in the resting state and that mechanical EC coupling of mammalian skeletal muscle involves fine temporal and voltage control of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release, which presumably facilitates precise control of many body movements.

# BOX 9-1 Defective EC Coupling in Muscle Due to Cav Channel Mutations 

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels have been linked to a large variety of genetic defects of skeletal muscle. In mice, an interesting mutation results in muscular dysgenesis, or failure of normal skeletal muscle to develop. These mice lack a functional $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel $\alpha_{1}$ subunit in their skeletal muscle. They die shortly after birth, but their cultured muscle cells provide an assay system to investigate the mechanism of EC coupling. Contraction of such defective muscle cells can be rescued by expression of cloned genes for either the skeletal Cav1.1 (CACNA1S gene) or the cardiac Cav1.2 (CACNA1C gene) L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. A key distinguishing feature of EC coupling in normal skeletal muscle versus cardiac muscle is the requirement for extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in cardiac muscle (see pp. 242-243) but not in skeletal muscle (see pp. 242-243). (5) N9-1 Indeed, when the rescue is accomplished with skeletal Cav1.1, contraction does not require extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. On the other hand, when the rescue is accomplished with cardiac Cav1.2, contraction does require extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

Such studies provide strong support for the concept that EC coupling (1) in skeletal muscle involves direct mechanical coupling of Cav1.1 to the RYR1 but (2) in cardiac muscle involves $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through Cav1.2 channels, which causes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see pp. 242-243). Experiments with chimeric cardiac and skeletal Cav channel isoforms have shown that the intracellular linker region between domains II and III (see Fig. $7-12 B$ ) determines whether EC coupling is of the skeletal or cardiac type.

Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (not to be confused with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis, discussed in Box 7-1) is an autosomal dominant muscle disease of humans. Affected family members have a point mutation in the CACNA1S gene encoding the skeletal Cav1.1, located in transmembrane segment S4 of domain II. This finding explains the basis for a human disorder involving defective EC coupling of skeletal muscle.

## Striations of skeletal muscle fibers correspond to ordered arrays of thick and thin filaments within myofibrils

Myofilaments are of two types: thick filaments composed primarily of a protein called myosin and thin filaments largely composed of a protein called actin (see pp. 25-28). The sarcomere is defined as the repeating unit between adjacent $Z$ disks or $Z$ lines (Fig. 9-4A, B). A myofibril is thus a linear array of sarcomeres stacked end to end. The highly
organized sarcomeres within skeletal and cardiac muscle are responsible for the striped or striated appearance of muscle fibers of these tissues as visualized by various microscopic imaging techniques. Thus, both skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle are referred to as striated muscle. In contrast, smooth muscle lacks striations because actin and myosin have a less regular pattern of organization in these myocytes.

In striated muscle, thin filaments-composed of actinare 5 to 8 nm in diameter and $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length. The plus end of the thin filaments attach to opposite faces of a dense disk

known as the $\mathbf{Z}$ disk (see Fig. 9-4B), which is perpendicular to the axis of the myofibril and has the diameter of the myofibril. Cross-linking the antiparallel thin filaments at the Z disk are $\alpha$-actinin proteins. Each $\alpha$-actinin is a rod-shaped antiparallel homodimer, 35 nm long and belonging to the spectrin family of actin-binding proteins. Two large proteins, titin and nebulin, are also tethered at the Z disks, as are other diverse proteins thought to be involved in stretch sensing and signal communication to the nucleus. Not only do Z disks tether the thin filaments of a single myofibril together, but connections between the Z disks also tether each myofibril to its neighbors and align the Z disks and thus the sarcomeres. In summary, Z disks have an important protein-organizing and tension-bearing role in the sarcomere structure.

The thick filaments-composed of myosin-are 10 to 15 nm in diameter and, in striated muscle, $1.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length (see Fig. 9-4B). They lie between and partially interdigitate with the thin filaments. This partial interdigitation results in alternating light and dark bands along the axis of the myofibril. The light bands, which represent regions of the thin filament that do not overlap with thick filaments, are known as I bands because they are isotropic to polarized light as demonstrated by polarization microscopy. The Z disk is visible as a dark perpendicular line at the center of the I band. The dark bands, which represent the myosin filaments, are known as A bands because they are anisotropic to polarized light. When the A band is viewed in cross section where the thick and thin filaments overlap, six thin filaments (actin) are seen to surround each thick filament (myosin) in a tightly packed hexagonal array (see Fig. 9-4C). During contraction, the I bands (nonoverlapping region of actin) shorten, while the A bands (myosin) do not change in length. This observation led to the idea that an energy-requiring ratcheting mechanism causes the thick and thin filaments to slide past each other-the sliding filament model of muscle contraction.

## Thin and thick filaments are supramolecular assemblies of protein subunits

Thin Filaments The backbone of the thin filament is a right-handed, two-stranded helix of noncovalently polymerized actin molecules, forming filamentous or F-actin (Fig. 9-5A). (○) N9-4 The fundamental unit is a supramolecular helix with a total of 13 molecules in the two strands and a length of $\sim 36 \mathrm{~nm}$. The muscle thin filament is an association of F-actin with two important regulatory actinbinding proteins: tropomyosin and the troponin complex.

The tropomyosin monomer of striated muscle is an $\alpha$-helical protein of 284 amino acids, consisting of seven pseudo-repeats of $\sim 40$ residues along the length of the molecule. The pseudo-repeats of the monomer determine its linearly coiled shape and define the binding to seven actin monomers along the thin filament. Two tropomyosin monomers form a dimer aligned in parallel and wound about each other in a coiled-coil structure. Two such tropomyosin dimers flank each supramolecular helix of actin (see Fig. 9-5A). Overlapping head-to-tail contacts between two tropomyosin dimers produce two nearly continuous doublehelical filaments that shadow the actin double helix. As we

describe below, tropomyosin acts as a gatekeeper in regulating the binding of myosin head groups to actin.

Troponin or the troponin complex is a heterotrimer consisting of the following:

1. Troponin T (TnT or TNNT), which binds to a single molecule of tropomyosin
2. Troponin C (TnC or TNNC), which binds $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Troponin C is closely related to another $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein, calmodulin (see p. 60).
3. Troponin I (TnI or TNNI), which binds to actin and inhibits contraction.

Thus, each troponin heterotrimer interacts with a single tropomyosin molecule, which in turn interacts with seven actin monomers. The troponin complex also interacts directly with the actin filaments. The coordinated interactions of troponin, tropomyosin, and actin allow the binding of actin and myosin to be regulated by changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$.

Thick Filaments Like actin thin filaments, thick filaments are also an intertwined complex of proteins (see Fig. 9-5B). In fast skeletal muscle, the thick filament is a bipolar superassembly of several hundred myosin II molecules, which are part of a larger family of myosins (see p. 25). Myosin II is responsible for ATP-dependent force generation in all types of myocytes. The myosin II molecule is a pair of identical

# N9-4 F-Actin 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Actin is perhaps the most abundant and highly conserved protein in eukaryotic cells. It is engaged in numerous proteinprotein cytoskeletal interactions in the cytoplasm. The $43-\mathrm{kDa}$, 375 -residue, soluble monomer form of actin is called G-actin. Aside from other cellular forms of cytoskeletal actin (see p. 25), there are three human isoforms of $\alpha$-actin involved in muscle contraction that correspond to separate actin genes expressed in skeletal muscle (ACTA1), smooth muscle (ACTA2), and cardiac muscle (ACTC1). As noted beginning on pages $25-28$, binding and hydrolysis of ATP controls polymerization of G-actin into the filamentous form of actin (F-actin) by sequential addition of actin monomers at the plus end of the molecule. Each actin molecule in F-actin interacts with four other actin molecules. The fundamental unit is a supramolecular helix (a double strand) with a total of 13 molecules in the two strands, and a length of $\sim 36 \mathrm{~nm}$ (see Fig. 9-5A).

heterotrimers, each composed of a myosin heavy chain (MHC), and two myosin light chains (MLCs). One MLC is an essential light chain (ELC or MLC-1), R9-5 and the other is a regulatory light chain (RLC or MLC-2). Both the MHCs and MLCs vary among muscle types (Table 9-1).

A myosin heavy chain molecule has $\sim 2000$ amino acids in three regions: N9-5 an N-terminal head region, a neck, and a C-terminal rod. The $\alpha$-helical rod portions of two MHCs wrap around each other to form a dimer; these dimers self-assemble into thick filaments. At the neck regions, the two MHCs of the dimer flare apart, leading to the two globular heads. Each MHC head has, at its tip, several loops that bind actin and, at its middle, a nucleotide site for binding and hydrolyzing ATP.

The essential light chain and regulatory light chainboth structurally related to the CaM superfamily-bind to and mechanically stabilize the $\alpha$-helical neck region. The phosphorylation of RLC by myosin light-chain kinases (MLCKs)-members of the CaMK family-enhances myosin cross-bridge interactions. Phosphatases have the opposite effect. In skeletal muscle, this phosphorylation is an important mechanism for force potentiation. Figure 9-6 illustrates how $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ triggers the interaction between a thin filament and a myosin head group from a thick filament.

Running alongside the thick filaments of skeletal muscle is a protein named titin-the largest known protein, with $\sim 25,000$ amino acids ( $\sim 3 \mathrm{MDa}$ ). The linear titin molecule spans one half the length of a sarcomere, with its N terminus tethered in the Z disk and its C terminus in the M line (see Fig. 9-4B). Within the M line are other proteins that crosslink the antiparallel myosin molecules at the middle of the
thick filament. Titin-the elastic filament of sarcomeresincludes $\sim 300$ immunoglobulin-like domains that appear to unfold reversibly upon stretch.

Nebulin is another large protein ( 600 to 900 kDa ) of muscle that runs from the Z disk along the actin thin filaments. Nebulin interacts with actin and controls the length of the thin filament; it also appears to function in sarcomere assembly by contributing to the structural integrity of myofibrils.

## During the cross-bridge cycle, contractile proteins convert the energy of ATP hydrolysis into mechanical energy

The fundamental process of skeletal muscle contraction involves a biochemical cycle, called the cross-bridge cycle, that occurs in six steps (Fig. 9-7). We start the cycle in the absence of both ATP and ADP, with the myosin head rigidly attached to an actin filament. In a corpse soon after death, the lack of ATP prevents the cycle from proceeding further; this leads to an extreme example of muscle rigidity-called rigor mortis-that is limited only by protein decomposition.

Step 1: ATP binding. ATP binding to the head of the MHC reduces the affinity of myosin for actin, which causes the myosin head to release from the actin filament. If all cross-bridges in a muscle were in this state, the muscle would be fully relaxed.
Step 2: ATP hydrolysis. The breakdown of ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ occurs on the myosin head; the products of hydrolysis are retained within the myosin

For historical reasons, the parts of the myosin II molecule in muscle often have more than one name.

- Myosin heavy chains (MHCs) consist of the following:
- The N-terminal head
- A neck or lever (or lever arm) or linker or hinge
- The C-terminal rod or tail
- Essential myosin light chains (ELCs or MLC-1) are also called alkali chains.
- Regulatory myosin light chains (RLCs or MLC-2).

active site. As a result of hydrolysis, the myosin head/neck pivots into a "cocked" position in which the head/neck are more colinear with the rod. This pivot causes the tip of the myosin head to move $\sim 11 \mathrm{~nm}$ along the actin filament so that it now lines up with a new actin monomer two monomers farther along the actin filament. (7) N9-6 If all cross-bridges in a muscle were in this state, the muscle would be fully relaxed.
Step 3: Weak cross-bridge formation. The cocked myosin head now binds loosely to a new position on the actin filament, scanning for a suitable binding site. Recall that six actin filaments surround each thick filament.
Step 4: Release of $\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ from the myosin. Dissociation of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ from the myosin head triggers an increased affinity of the myosin-ADP complex for actin-the strong cross-bridge state. The transition from weak to strong binding is the rate-limiting step in the cross-bridge cycle.
Step 5: Power stroke. A conformational change causes the myosin neck to rotate around the myosin head, which
remains firmly fixed to the actin. This bending pulls the rod of the myosin, drawing the actin and myosin filaments past one another by a distance of $\sim 11 \mathrm{~nm}$. The myosin head/neck is now angled with respect to the rod. At the macroscopic level, this activity pulls the Z lines closer together and shortens the sarcomere, with concurrent force generation.
Step 6: ADP release. Dissociation of ADP from myosin completes the cycle, and the actomyosin complex is left in a rigid, "attached state." The relative positions of the actin versus the myosin head, neck, and rod remain the same until another ATP molecule binds and initiates another cycle (step 1).

The ADP-free myosin complex ("Attached State" in Fig. 9-7) would quickly bind ATP at the concentrations of ATP normally found within cells. Each round of the cross-bridge cycle consumes one molecule of ATP; we discuss the regeneration of ATP in muscle beginning on pages 1208-1209. If

# N9-6 Measuring the Force of a Single Cross-Bridge Cycle 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The force of a single cross-bridge cycle has been measured directly. Finer, Simmons, and Spudich used optical tweezers to manipulate a single actin filament and to place it in proximity to a myosin molecule immobilized on a bead (eFig. 9-2A). With the use of video-enhanced microscopy these investigators were able to detect movements of the actin filament as small as 1 nm . The optical tweezers could also exert an adjustable force opposing movement of the actin filament. When the tweezers applied only a small opposing force and the experiment was conducted in the presence of ATP, the researchers observed that the actin moved over the myosin bead in step-like displacements of 11 nm . This observation, made under "microscopically isotonic"
conditions, suggests that the quantal displacement of a single cross-bridge cycle is $\sim 11 \mathrm{~nm}$ (see eFig. 9-2B). When the tweezers applied a force sufficiently large to immobilize the actin filament, the investigators observed step-like impulses of force that averaged $\sim 5 \mathrm{pN}$ (see eFig. 9-2C). This observation, made under "microscopically isometric" conditions, suggests that the quantal force developed during a single cross-bridge cycle is $\sim 5 \mathrm{pN}$. Interestingly, these isometric force impulses lasted longer when the ATP concentration was lower. This last finding is consistent with the notion that ATP binding to myosin must occur to allow detachment of the cross-bridges (step 1 in the cycle in Fig. 9-7).

## A EXPERIMENTAL PREPARATION

![bo2464543376c](bo2464543376c.jpg)
eFigure 9-2 Microscopic measurements of cross-bridge force and displacement. A, An actin filament is attached at each end to a polystyrene bead. The optical tweezers, a finely focused beam of laser light, can trap the bead at its focal point and physically move it. By adjusting the laser intensity, the experimenter can alter the strength of the trap (i.e., the force with which the bead is held). In this experiment, two optical tweezers were used to suspend the actin filament above a coverglass. Attached to this coverglass is a silica bead, and myosin molecules are bound to the bead. B, In an isotonic experiment, the force between the actin filament and the fixed myosin/silica bead is kept constant by use of a stable laser intensity. The experimenter measures, as a function of time, the displacement of the polystyrene bead away from the center of the trap. Thus, in one cross-bridge cycle, the myosin-actin interaction pulls the polystyrene bead $\sim 11 \mathrm{~nm}$ away from the center of the trap. C, In an isometric experiment, the experimenter measures, as a function of time, the extra force that needs to be applied (i.e., increase in laser intensity) to keep the polystyrene bead at a fixed position near the center of the trap. Thus, in one cross-bridge cycle, the myosin-actin interaction exerts a force of $\sim 5 \mathrm{pN}$. (Data from Finer JT, Mehta AD, Spudich JA: Characterization of single actinmyosin interactions.

Figure 9-7 Cross-bridge cycle in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Each cycle advances the myosin head by two actin monomers, or $\sim 11 \mathrm{~nm}$.
unrestrained, this cross-bridge cycling would continue until the cytoplasm is depleted of ATP—rigor mortis.

The biochemical steps of the cross-bridge cycle reveal that [ATP] ${ }_{i}$ does not regulate the cross-bridge cycle of actinmyosin interaction. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, temporal control of the cycle of contraction occurs at the third step by prevention of cross-bridge formation until the tropomyosin moves out of the way in response to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$-as we will see in the next section.

## An increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ triggers contraction by removing the inhibition of cross-bridge cycling

In skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle, an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ initiates and allows cross-bridge cycling to continue. During this excitatory increase, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ may rise from its resting level of $<10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$ to $>10^{-5} \mathrm{M}$. The subsequent decrease in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}-$ discussed in the next section-is the signal to cease crossbridge cycling and relax.

Regardless of the muscle type, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ exerts its effect by binding to regulatory proteins rather than directly interacting with contractile proteins. In the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, these regulatory proteins act in concert to inhibit actin-myosin interactions, thus inhibiting the contractile process. When $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to one or more of these proteins, a conformational change takes place in the regulatory complex that releases the inhibition of contraction. In both skeletal and cardiac muscle, the regulatory proteins form the troponin complex, which is composed of troponin C, troponin I, and troponin T. The troponin T (TnT) binds to tropomyosin, establishing the linkage between the troponin complex and tropomyosin.

In skeletal muscle, the TNNC2 subtype of troponin C (TnC) has two pairs of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding sites. Two high-affinity sites-located on the C-lobe of TNNC2-are always occupied by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ under physiological conditions. These sites on TNNC2 bind to troponin I (TnI). On the other hand, two low-affinity sites-located on the N-lobe of TNNC2-bind and release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ as $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ rises and falls. At low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, the N-lobe of TnC does not bind to TnI (see Fig. 9-6), which allows the TnI to bind to a particular spot on F-actin and thereby prevent the binding of myosin. At high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, the N -lobe of TnC can now interact with TnI in such a way as to cause tropomyosin to translocate by 25 degrees on the F-actin surface, which allows the cocked myosin head group to interact weakly with actin (see Fig. 9-7, step 3 of the cross-bridge cycle). As long as $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ remains high and the tropomyosin is out of the way, cross-bridge cycling will continue indefinitely. (0) N9-7

## Termination of contraction requires re-uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the SR

After the action potential in the skeletal muscle has subsided, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ must be removed from the sarcoplasm for contraction actually to cease and for relaxation to occur. Removal of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasm occurs by two mechanisms. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may be extruded across the cell plasma membrane or sequestered within intracellular compartments (Fig. 9-8).

The cell may extrude $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by use of either an NCX (Na-Ca exchanger, SLC8 family; see p. 123) or PMCA (plasma membrane Ca-ATPase or pump; see p. 118). Extrusion across the cell membrane, however, would eventually totally deplete the cell of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and is therefore a minor mechanism for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ removal from the cytoplasm. Instead, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ re-uptake into the SR is the most important mechanism by which the cell returns $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to resting levels. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ re-uptake by the SR is mediated by a SERCA (sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase or pump; see p. 118). (0) N9-8

High $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ within the SR lumen inhibits the activity of SERCA, an effect attenuated by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins within the SR lumen. These $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins buffer the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ increase in the SR during $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ re-uptake and thus markedly increase the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ storage capacity of the SR. The principal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein in skeletal muscle, calsequestrin (CSQ), is also present in cardiac and some smooth muscle. Calreticulin is a ubiquitous $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein that is found in particularly high concentrations within the SR of smooth muscle. These proteins have a tremendous capacity

to bind $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, with up to 50 binding sites per protein molecule.

CSQ forms oligomers in the SR lumen and is highly localized to the region of the SR immediately beneath the triad junction, where it forms a complex with the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel and with two other RYR-anchoring proteinsjunctin and triadin-and senses free $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ inside the SR. During high action potential frequency, $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ content falls, and dissociation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from CSQ leads to deactivation of RYR, thereby preserving $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (Box 9-2).

## Muscle contractions produce force under isometric conditions and force with shortening under isotonic conditions

The total force generated by a muscle is the sum of the forces generated by many independently cycling actin-myosin cross-bridges. The number of simultaneously cycling crossbridges depends substantially on the initial length of the muscle fiber and on the pattern or frequency of muscle cell stimulation. When muscle is stimulated to contract, it exerts a force tending to pull the attachment points at either end toward each other. This force is referred to as the tension developed by the muscle.

Two mechanical—and artificial-arrangements can be used to study force and length relationships in muscle contraction. In one, the attachment points are immobile, so that the muscle length is fixed. Here, stimulation causes an increase in tension, but no shortening. Because these contractions occur at constant length, they are referred to as

# N9-7 Tropomyosin-Troponin Interactions-the "Functional Group" of the Thin Filament 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

As discussed in the text, troponin (which consists of troponin T, C, and I) interacts with one tropomyosin molecule, which in turn interacts with seven actin monomers (see Fig. 9-6). The region along a thin filament that falls under the control of a single troponin molecule is a functional group. However, overlap of troponin T onto the junction between two tropomyosin dimers (recall that the tropomyosin molecules stack end to end, with overlap, to create a continuous filament) may allow a single troponin complex to control-via the two tropomyosin dimers-a functional group of 14 or more actin molecules.

In the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, tropomyosin is bound in a position along the actin filament that blocks its interaction with myosin.

When $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to the troponin complex, the tropomyosin shifts from its original position along the actin (eFig. 9-3, red areal-the blocked off-state-to a new position caused by an azimuthal rotation of $\sim 25$ degrees on the F-actin surface (see eFig. 9-3, yellow areal-the $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$-activated state. This displacement enables myosin to bind to actin, which results in another $\sim 10$ degree azimuthal movement of tropomyosin (see eFig. 9-3, green areal; this shift allows myosin to engage in mechanical activitythe fully activated state.

## N9-8 SERCA Isoforms

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

SERCA is an acronym for sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase. The energy for Ca pumping comes from the hydrolysis of ATP. As discussed on page 126 in the text (also see (O) N5-18), the $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$-transporting protein is an $\mathrm{E}_{1}-\mathrm{E}_{2}$ (or P-type) ATPase that has a molecular weight of 110 kDa . Three different SERCA isoforms are known.

All of the SERCA isoforms (SERCA1, SERCA2, and SERCA3) are Ca-H exchange pumps. The SERCA2 isoform may be expressed as two alternatively spliced variants. The SERCA1 isoform is expressed in fast-twitch skeletal muscle, which is a subtype of skeletal muscle fibers that contract rapidly (see Table 9-1). The SERCA2a isoform is found in slowtwitch skeletal muscle as well as cardiac and smooth muscle. The SERCA2b isoform is found in smooth-muscle cells; it is also heavily expressed in the ER of nonmuscle cells. Table 9-1 summarizes the distribution of the SERCA isoforms among muscle types.

Note that all of the SR Ca pumps (i.e., SERCAs) are distinct from the Ca pumps in the plasma membrane, which are known as PMCAs (see p. 126).

# B0X 9-2 Malignant Hyperthermia and Central Core Disease-RYR Channelopathies 

Malignant hyperthermia (MH) affects between 1 in 15,000 children and 1 in 50,000 adults undergoing anesthesia. It is a genetic disorder that may affect as many as 1 in 2000 to 3000 individuals in the general population. Affected individuals are at risk of a potentially life-threatening syndrome on exposure to particular inhalation anesthetic agents, especially halothane, sevoflurane, and desflurane. Administration of the muscle relaxant succinylcholine (see pp. 225-226) can also trigger or exaggerate MH. Onset of MH syndrome in the setting of the operating room is typified by the development of tachypnea (rapid breathing), low plasma $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$, high plasma $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$, tachycardia (rapid heart rate), and hyperthermia (rising body temperature) as well as by rigidity, sweating, and dramatic swings in blood pressure. The patient's temperature may rise as rapidly as $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ every 5 minutes. The onset of MH is usually during anesthesia, but it can occur up to several hours later. If the condition is untreated, the patient will develop respiratory and lactic acidosis, muscle rigidity, and a breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and thus profound hyperkalemia. These episodes reflect a progressively severe hypermetabolic state in the muscle tissues. Fortunately, our evolving understanding of the pathophysiology of MH has led to the development of a therapeutic regimen that has greatly improved the once-dismal prognosis.

The major features of the syndrome-hyperthermia, muscle rigidity, and an increased metabolic rate-led early investigators to suggest that MH is a disease of abnormal regulation of muscle contraction. We now understand that uncontrolled $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release-somehow triggered by the administration of halothane and succinylcholine-causes excessive contraction and ATP hydrolysis. As muscle tries to replenish its ATP stores, mitochondrial oxidative metabolism increases. Hyperthermia develops because of the heat liberated by these metabolic processes.

The incidence of MH is particularly high in swine, in which episodes are triggered by a variety of physical and environmental stresses (porcine stress syndrome). MH in animals has significant economic importance in view of the potential loss from fatal episodes and the devaluation of meat as a result of muscle destruction during nonfatal episodes.

When exposed to halothane, muscle biopsy samples from susceptible individuals develop more tension than fibers from normal individuals. In muscle fibers from both humans and a strain of swine susceptible to $\mathrm{MH}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR is enhanced compared with that in fibers from unaffected subjects. Furthermore, caffeine, which causes the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels to open, induced greater contractions in fibers from susceptible subjects. Taken together, these observations suggested that MH results from an abnormality in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel in the SR membrane.

In both humans and animals, inheritance of MH follows a mendelian autosomal dominant pattern. Approximately 200 mutations in the human RYR1 have been linked to MH and central core disease (discussed below). The mutations tend to cluster in three "hot spots" of the channel protein: the N -terminal, central, and C-terminal regions. Some of these mutations increase the sensitivity of the RYR1 to activation by halothane and caffeine. They may also act by a "gain-of-function" effect that promotes the constitutive leakage of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR. In swine, MH results from a single amino-acid substitution in RYR1 (cysteine for arginine at position 615), the skeletal muscle isoform. The analogous R614C substitution is present in some human kindreds as well. This substitution increases the open probability of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel.

Therapy for MH involves intravenous administration of the drug dantrolene, cessation of anesthesia, and aggressive efforts aimed at cooling the body. Dantrolene is an effective therapeutic agent because it blocks RYR1, thus interrupting the otherwise uncontrolled release of SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and progression of muscle contractions. The drug can be given acutely in an effort to abort an ongoing attack or, in a person known to be at risk, it can be given before the initiation of anesthesia to prevent onset of the syndrome. Dantrolene treatment has decreased mortality due to MH from $80 \%$ to $<10 \%$ today. Therapy also includes intravenous hydration and the judicious use of diuretics to keep the urine flowing; this lessens damage to the kidneys from the release of breakdown products, such as myoglobin from the damaged muscles. Sodium bicarbonate is given to counter the lactic acidosis, and patients may be mechanically hyperventilated to blow off the excess $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. For patients known to be at risk of MH , alternative forms of pain suppression that can be safely used for necessary surgical procedures include nitrous oxide, propofol, opiates, and benzodiazepines. Local anesthetics such as lidocaine are also safe.

Despite the intensive protocol just outlined, MH is still regarded as an emergency in the operating room. The relatives of a patient with a documented history of one episode of MH should be carefully screened to see whether they, too, carry the inherited trait; many of the affected relatives may demonstrate baseline elevations in muscle enzyme levels in their blood (e.g., an increase in creatine kinase levels).

As noted above, mutations in RYR1 have also been linked to central core disease (CCD), also called central core myopathy. CCD is a congenital autosomal dominant genetic condition defined by the histopathological appearance of so-called core regions within skeletal muscle cells that are devoid of mitochondria and are inactive with respect to oxidative metabolism. Symptoms of CCD include muscle weakness in young patients and skeletal abnormalities. Some CCD patients are also susceptible to MH.
isometric contractions (Fig. 9-9A). In the second arrangement, one of the two attachment points is mobile and tethered to a variable load, which tends to pull this mobile point away from the fixed one. Here, stimulation causes shortening, provided the tension developed by the muscle is greater than the opposing load. Because these shortenings occur at constant load, they are referred to as isotonic contractions (see Fig. 9-9B). (○) N9-6 Both isometric and isotonic contractions can be examined at different initial muscle lengths. Moreover, they can be measured during individual muscle twitches evoked by single muscle action potentials as
well as during other patterns of stimulation. Physical activity involves various combinations of isometric and isotonic contractions.

## Muscle length influences tension development by determining the degree of overlap between actin and myosin filaments

The isometric force of contractions depends on the initial length of the muscle fiber. Unstimulated muscle may be elongated somewhat by applying tension and stretching it. The

Figure 9-9 Isometric and isotonic contraction. A, Experimental preparation for study of muscle contraction under isometric conditions. B, Experimental preparation for study of muscle contraction under isotonic conditions. C, The "Passive" curve represents the tension that is measured at various muscle lengths before muscle contraction. The "Total" curve represents the tension that is measured at various muscle lengths during muscle contraction. Muscle length is expressed as the percent of "optimal" length; that is, the length at which active isometric tension is maximal. D, The active tension is the difference between the total and the passive tensions in $\mathbf{C}$. E, Points A, A1, A2, and A3 on the blue curve show that the velocity of muscle shortening is greater if the muscle lifts a lighter weight-it is easier to lift a feather (left side of each curve/ low load) than to lift a barbell (right side of each curve/high load). The blue, green, and gold curves also show that for any given velocity of shortening, a longer muscle can develop a greater tension than can a shorter muscle.

tension measured before muscle contraction is referred to as passive tension (see Fig. 9-9C). Because muscle gets stiffer as it is distended, it takes increasing amounts of passive tension to progressively elongate the muscle cell. If at any fixed length (i.e., isometric conditions) the muscle is stimulated to contract, an additional active tension develops because of cross-bridge cycling. The total measured tension is thus the sum of the passive and active tension. This incremental or active tension-the difference between total tension and passive tension-is quite small when the muscle is less than $-70 \%$ of its normal resting length (see Fig. 9-9D). As muscle length increases toward its normal length, active tension increases. Active tension is maximal at an optimal length (blue point in Fig. 9-9D)—usually called $L_{0}$-that is near the normal muscle length. Active tension decreases with further lengthening; thus, active tension is again small when the muscle is stretched beyond $150 \%$ of its normal resting length. Although the relationship between muscle length and tension has been best characterized for skeletal muscle, the tension of cardiac and smooth muscle also appears to depend on length in a similar manner.

This length-tension relationship is a direct result of the anatomy of the thick and thin filaments within individual sarcomeres (see Fig. 9-9D). As muscle length increases, the ends of the actin filaments arising from neighboring Z disks are pulled away from each other. When length is increased beyond $150 \%$ of the resting sarcomere length, the ends of the actin filaments are pulled beyond the ends of the myosin filaments. Under this condition, no interaction occurs between actin and myosin filaments and hence no active tension develops. As muscle length shortens from this point, actin and myosin filaments begin to overlap and tension can develop; the amount of tension developed corresponds to the degree of overlap between the actin and the myosin filaments. As the muscle shortens further, opposing actin filaments slide over one another and the ends of the myosin filaments and-with extreme degrees of shorteningeventually butt up against the opposing Z disks. Under these conditions, the spatial relationship between actin and myosin is distorted and active tension falls. The maximal degree of overlap between actin and myosin filaments, and hence maximal active tension, corresponds to a sarcomere length that is near its normal resting length.

## At higher loads, the velocity of shortening is lower because more cross-bridges are simultaneously active

Under isotonic conditions, the velocity of shortening decreases as the applied load opposing contraction of the muscle fiber increases. This point is obvious; anyone can lift a single French fry much faster than a sack of potatoes. As shown for any of the three downward-sloping curves in Figure 9-9E-each of which represents a different initial length of muscle-there is an inverse relationship between velocity and load. Note that for isotonic contractions, the applied load is the same as the tension in the muscle.

The load (or tension)-velocity relationship is perhaps best understood by first considering the condition at points A, B, and C in Figure 9-9E, where-for each muscle length-we choose a different load that is just adequate to
prevent shortening or lengthening (i.e., isometric conditions). Point A represents the optimal length for supporting the largest isometric tension (represented by the blue point in Fig. 9-9D). Here, all available cross-bridges are engaged in resisting the opposing force, and none is left over to make the muscle shorten. If we could somehow decrease the number of engaged cross-bridges, the muscle would lengthen. On the other hand, starting at point A, if we decrease the load at the same initial muscle length, the number of cross-bridges already engaged is now more than needed to resist the opposing load. The extra cross-bridges are available to ratchet the thick myosin filaments over the thin actin filaments, but at a very low initial velocity (point $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ ). Returning to the isometric condition at point A , if we were to reduce the lower load even more, then even more cross-bridges would be available for ratcheting the myosin over the actin, and the initial velocity would be even higher (point $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ ). Again returning to the isometric condition at point A , if we make the load vanishingly small, the initial velocity is very high because the speed with which the thick and thin filaments slide over each other is limited only by the speed at which the cross-bridges can cycle. Viewed from a different perspective, as we increase velocity, the probability of actin-myosin interactions decreases, fewer cross-bridges are simultaneously active, and less tension develops.

Recall that the blue curve in Figure 9-9E applies to a single initial length of the muscle, that is, the optimal length. We already saw in Figure 9-9D that, starting at the optimal length, reducing initial muscle length causes isometric tension to fall. The points A, B, and C in Figure 9-9E restate this relationship: the shorter the initial length, the smaller the maximal load under zero-velocity conditions. As we decrease the load, starting from point B (green curve) or point C (brown curve), the initial velocity of shortening rises, as we saw for the blue curve. Note that all three curves extrapolate to the same initial maximal velocity at zero load. The explanation for this effect, as already noted, is that maximal velocity (at no load) depends on the maximal rate of cross-bridge turnover, not on the initial overlap of the thin and thick filaments.

The velocity-tension curve reveals an interesting relationship between muscle power and applied load. Muscle does measurable mechanical work only when it displaces a load. This mechanical work ( $W$ ) is the product of load $(F)$ and displacement $(\Delta x)$. Power $(P)$ is the rate at which work is performed, or work per unit time $(\Delta t)$ :

$$
P=\frac{W}{\Delta t}=\frac{F \cdot \Delta x}{\Delta t}
$$

Because velocity $(v)$ is $\Delta x / \Delta t$, it follows that

$$
P=F \cdot v
$$

For a given load $(F)$, we can calculate the power by reading the velocity $(v)$ from the uppermost of the three blue loadvelocity relationships in Figure 9-9E. Power is maximal at intermediate loads (where both $F$ and $v$ are moderate) and falls to zero at maximum load (where $v=0$ ) and at zero load (where $F=0$ ).

Figure 9-10 Frequency summation of skeletal muscle twitches.

## In a single skeletal muscle fiber, the force developed may be increased by summing multiple twitches in time

At sufficiently low stimulation frequencies, the tension developed falls to the resting level between individual twitches (Fig. 9-10A). Single skeletal muscle twitches last between 25 and 200 ms , depending on the type of muscle. Although each twitch is elicited by a single muscle action potential, the duration of contraction is long compared with the duration of the exciting action potential, which lasts only several milliseconds. Because the muscle twitch far exceeds the duration of the action potential, it is possible to initiate a second action potential before a first contraction has fully subsided. When this situation occurs, the second action potential stimulates a twitch that is superimposed on the residual tension of the first twitch and thereby achieves greater isometric tension than the first (compare Fig. 9-10A and 9-10B). This effect is known as summation.

If multiple action potentials occur close enough in time, the multiple twitches can summate and thus greatly increase the tension developed. Summation is more effective at increasing tension when the action potentials are grouped more closely in time, as in Figure 9-10C. In other words, tension is higher when action potentials are evoked at higher frequency. Because this type of tension enhancement depends on the frequency of muscle stimulation, it is referred to as frequency summation.

When the stimulation frequency is increased sufficiently, the individual twitches occur so close together in time that they fuse (see Fig. 9-10D) and cause the muscle tension to remain at a steady plateau. The state in which the individual twitches are no longer distinguishable from each other is referred to as tetanus. Tetanus arises when the time between successive action potentials is insufficient to return enough $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to the SR to lower $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ below a level that initiates relaxation. In fact, a sustained increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ persists until the tetanic stimulus ceases. At stimulation frequencies above the fusion frequency that causes tetanus, muscle fiber tension increases very little.

Figure 9-11 The motor unit and the motor-neuron pool.

## In a whole skeletal muscle, the force developed may be increased by summing the contractions of multiple fibers

In addition to determining the frequency with which it stimulates a single muscle fiber, the CNS can control muscle force by determining the number of individual muscle fibers that it stimulates at a given time. As each additional motorneuron cell body within the spinal cord is excited, those muscle fibers that are part of the motor unit of that motor neuron are added to the contracting pool of fibers (Fig. 9-11). This effect is known as multiple-fiber summation.

In general, smaller motor neurons serve motor units consisting of fewer individual muscle fibers. Because a given excitatory stimulus will generate a larger excitatory postsynaptic potential (see p. 210) in motor neurons with smaller cell bodies, the small motor units are recruited even with minimal neuronal stimulation. As neuronal stimulation intensifies, larger motor neurons innervating larger motor units are also recruited. The progressive recruitment of first small and then larger and larger motor units is referred to as the size principle (see pp. 1204-1205). The group of all motor neurons innervating a single muscle is called a motorneuron pool.

Multiple-fiber summation, sometimes referred to as spatial summation, is an important mechanism that allows the force developed by a whole muscle to be relatively constant in time. It is true that the CNS could direct the force to be relatively constant over time merely by driving a fixed number of motor units within the muscle to tetanus, where the force fluctuations are very small (see Fig. 9-10D). However, adding tetanic motor units would increase total muscle force by rather large individual increments. Instead, the CNS can activate individual motor units asynchronously so that some units are developing tension while others are relaxing. Thus, whole-muscle force can be relatively constant with time, even when individual fibers are not stimulated to tetanus. Smooth, nontetanic contraction is essential for fine motor control.

## CARDIAC MUSCLE

## Action potentials propagate between adjacent cardiac myocytes through gap junctions

Cardiac muscle and its individual myocytes have a morphological character different from that of skeletal muscle and its cells (Fig. 9-12). Cardiac myocytes are shorter, branched, and interconnected from end to end by structures called intercalated disks, visible as dark lines in the light microscope. The intercalated disks connecting the ends of adjoining cardiac myocytes contain desmosomes (see p. 45) that link adjacent cells mechanically and gap junctions (see pp. 158-159) that link cells electrically. Cardiac muscle thus acts as a mechanical and electrical syncytium of coupled cells, unlike skeletal muscle fibers, which are separate cells bundled together by connective tissue. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated (see pp. 232-233) and its sarcomeres contain similar arrays of thin and thick filaments.

Contraction of cardiac muscle cells is not initiated by neurons as in skeletal muscle but by electrical excitation originating from the heart's own pacemaker, the sinoatrial node. When an action potential is initiated in one cell, current flows through the gap junctions and depolarizes neighboring cells, producing self-propagating action potentials. Beginning on page 483, we will consider cardiac electrophysiology in depth.

Cardiac myocytes receive synaptic input from autonomic neurons, but the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 14) use these synapses to modulate rather than to initiate electrical activity and contractile force of cardiac muscle.
![bo2534543376c](bo2534543376c.jpg)

Figure 9-12 Electrical coupling of cardiac myocytes.

## Cardiac contraction requires $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels

Whereas EC coupling in skeletal muscle does not require $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 190-193), cardiac contraction has an absolute requirement for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through these channels during the action potential. Cardiac myocytes have a T-tubule network similar to that of skeletal muscle myofibers except that a single terminal cisterna of the SR forms a dyad junction with the T-tubule rather than a triad junction. Furthermore, T-tubules of cardiac myocytes are located at the Z lines separating sarcomeres rather than at the A-I band junctions. Because the T-tubule lumen is an extension of the extracellular space, it facilitates the diffusion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from bulk extracellular fluid to the site of the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels on the T-tubule membrane. Thus, the extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can simultaneously reach superficial and deep regions of the muscle. The increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ resulting from $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels alone is not, however, sufficient to initiate contraction. Rather, this increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ leads to an opening of the RYR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels in the SR membrane. The resulting release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR amplifies the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ by a process known as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (CICR). Indeed, because the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels remain open for a longer period than do L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, the contribution of CICR to the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is greater than the flux contributed by the L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels of the T tubules. As noted above for skeletal muscle, single $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release events from local clusters of RYR1 channels-known as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks-are the unitary events underlying EC coupling in

cardiac muscle. (○) N9-3 Summation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spark/CICR events, initially activated by membrane depolarization, results in a wave of increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, along the cell. (○) N9-9

Beginning on page 522, we consider cardiac EC coupling in depth.

## Cross-bridge cycling and termination of cardiac muscle contraction are similar to the events in skeletal muscle

Cardiac muscle is similar to skeletal muscle in the interaction of the actin and myosin during cross-bridge cycling, the resynthesis of ATP, and the termination of contraction. However, there are a few important differences. For example, the regulatory protein troponin C (see Fig. 9-6) of cardiac muscle (TNNC1) binds three $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions per molecule versus the four for TNNC2 in skeletal muscle (see p. 237). More importantly, in cardiac muscle, SR Ca-pump activity is inhibited by the regulatory protein phospholamban (PLN). When PLN is phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent PKA, its ability to inhibit the SR Ca pump is lost. Thus, activators of PKA, such as the neurotransmitter epinephrine, may enhance the rate of cardiac myocyte relaxation. Beginning on page 522, we consider cardiac contraction and relaxation in depth.

## In cardiac muscle, increasing the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enhances the contractile force

Whereas frequency summation and multiple-fiber summation are important mechanisms for regulating the strength of skeletal muscle contractions, these mechanisms would not be consistent with the physiological demands of cardiac muscle. Because cardiac muscle must contract only once with each heartbeat and must fully relax between each contraction, frequency summation is precluded. Furthermore, the extensive electrical coupling between cardiac myocytes, as well as the requirement that cardiac muscle contract homogeneously, eliminates the potential for multiple-fiber summation. Therefore, the strength of cardiac muscle contraction must be regulated by modulating the contractile force generated during each individual muscle twitch. This type of regulation is an important part of the adaptive response to exercise and is mediated by norepinephrine,
a neurotransmitter released by the sympathetic nervous system.

The contractile function in cardiac muscle is regulated either by modulating the magnitude of the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ or by altering the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of the regulatory proteins. Beginning on page 539 (see Tables 23-1 and 23-2), we discuss the modulation of these events by the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 14).

## SMOOTH MUSCLE

## Smooth muscles may contract in response to synaptic transmission or electrical coupling

Like skeletal muscle, smooth muscle receives synaptic input. However, the synaptic input to smooth muscle differs from that of skeletal muscle in two ways. First, the neurons are part of the autonomic nervous system rather than the somatic nervous system (see Chapter 14). Second, the neuron makes multiple synaptic contacts with a smooth-muscle cell in the form of a series of swellings called varicosities (see pp. 340341) that contain the presynaptic machinery for vesicular release of transmitter. Each varicosity is close to the postsynaptic membrane of the smooth-muscle cell, but there is relatively little specialization of the postsynaptic membrane.

The mechanisms of intercellular communication between smooth-muscle cells vary more widely among tissues. There are two basic types of smooth-muscle tissues known as multiunit and single-unit smooth muscle. In multiunit smooth muscle, each smooth-muscle cell receives synaptic input but there is little intercellular electrical coupling between cells (i.e., few gap junctions). As a result, each smooth-muscle cell may contract independently of its neighbor. Thus, the term multiunit describes smooth muscle that behaves like multiple, independent cells or groups of cells (Fig. 9-13A). Multiunit smooth muscles are capable of fine control. Indeed, multiunit smooth muscle is found in the iris and ciliary body of the eye as well as the piloerector muscles of the skin.

Unitary or single-unit smooth muscle (see Fig. 9-13B) is a group of cells that work as a syncytium because gap junctions provide electrical and chemical communication between neighboring cells. Direct electrical coupling allows

# N9-9 Propagation of the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ Wave in Cardiac Muscle 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Although $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diffuses in the cytosol away from its SR release site, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release at one site does not appear to be able to induce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from a neighboring $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel. Thus, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release events are not propagated along the myocyte. In fact, the $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel does not appear to respond to generalized increases in cytoplasmic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Generalized cardiac muscle contractions occur as a result of the spatial and temporal summation of individual CICR events.

coordinated contraction of many cells. Gap junctions also allow ions and small molecules to diffuse between cells, which gives rise to phenomena such as spreading $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves among coupled cells. Unitary smooth muscle is the predominant smooth-muscle type within the walls of visceral organs such as the gastrointestinal and urinary tracts, the uterus, and many blood vessels. In certain organs, adjacent smoothmuscle cells are physically connected by adhering junctions that provide mechanical stability to the tissue. Thus, unitary smooth muscle is often referred to as visceral smooth muscle. The functional size of the unit depends on the strength of intercellular coupling. For example, in the bladder, extensive coupling among cells defines large functional units, which allows the cells of the muscular wall of the bladder to contract in synchrony. On the other hand, the smooth-muscle cells of blood vessels couple to form smaller, independently functioning units that are more akin to multiunit smooth muscle. In fact, electrical coupling of smooth-muscle units exhibits a tissue-specific continuum from multiunit to unitary coupling.

## Action potentials of smooth muscles may be brief or prolonged

Although action potentials initiate contraction in both skeletal and cardiac muscle, diverse changes in membrane potential $\left(V_{m}\right)$ can either initiate or modulate contraction in smooth-muscle cells. Action potentials that are similar to those seen in skeletal muscle are observed in unitary smooth muscle and in some multiunit muscles. Like cardiac muscle cells, some smooth-muscle cells exhibit prolonged action potentials that are characterized by a prominent plateau phase. Still other smooth-muscle cells cannot generate action potentials at all. In these cells, $V_{m}$ changes in a graded fashion (see pp. 174-176) rather than in the all-or-none manner of action potentials. The stimuli that produce a graded response of $V_{m}$ include many circulating and local humoral factors as well as mechanical stimuli such as stretching of the cell. These graded $V_{m}$ changes may be either hyperpolarizing or depolarizing; they sum temporally as well as spatially. If the summation of graded depolarizations brings $V_{m}$ above threshold, action potentials will fire in electrically excitable smooth-muscle cells.

Action potentials-characteristic responses of unitary (visceral) smooth muscle-typically have a slower upstroke and longer duration (up to $\sim 100 \mathrm{~ms}$ ) than do skeletal muscle action potentials ( $\sim 2 \mathrm{~ms}$ ). The action potential in a smoothmuscle cell can be a simple spike, a spike followed by a plateau, or a series of spikes on top of slow waves of $V_{m}$ (Fig. 9-14A). In any case, the depolarizing phase of the action potential reflects opening of L-type voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The initial inward $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current further depolarizes the cell and thereby causes still more voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels to open in positive-feedback fashion. Thus, some smoothmuscle cells exhibit the same type of regenerative all-or-none depolarization that is seen in skeletal muscle. However, the rate of rise of the action potential in smooth muscle is typically slower because Cav channels (see pp. 190-193) open more slowly than do Nav channels (see pp. 187-189) of skeletal and cardiac muscle. Repolarization of the smoothmuscle cell is also relatively slow because L-type Cav $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
channels exhibit prolonged openings and inactivate slowly. In addition, the slow repolarization reflects the delayed activation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and, in many cases, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which depend on significant elevation of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.

Some smooth-muscle cells also express fast voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. However, these channels do not appear to be necessary for generating an action potential but rather contribute to a greater rate of depolarization and thus the activation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

In some types of unitary smooth muscle, repolarization is so delayed that the action potential waveform displays a prominent plateau lasting several hundred millisecondsas in cardiac muscle. Plateau action potentials occur in smooth muscle of the genitourinary tract, including the ureters, bladder, and uterus. The long plateau allows prolonged entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, thereby elevating $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and prolonging the contraction.

## Some smooth-muscle cells spontaneously generate either pacemaker currents or slow waves

Although smooth-muscle cells undergo changes in $V_{m}$ in response to neural, hormonal, or mechanical stimulation, many smooth-muscle cells are capable of initiating spontaneous electrical activity. In some tissues, this spontaneous activity results from pacemaker currents. In the intestine for example, special pacemaker cells called interstitial cells of Cajal initiate and control rhythmic contractions of the smooth-muscle layers. Pacemaker electrical activity arises from time- and voltage-dependent properties of ion channels that spontaneously produce either an increase in inward depolarizing currents (e.g., voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents) or a decrease in outward hyperpolarizing currents (e.g., voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$currents). If $V_{m}$ reaches threshold, an action potential fires.

In other smooth-muscle cells, this spontaneous electrical activity results in regular, repetitive oscillations in $V_{m}$-and contractions-that occur at a frequency of several cycles per minute. These are referred to as slow waves (see Fig. 9-14B). One hypothesis regarding the origin of slow-wave potentials suggests that voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels-active at the resting $V_{m}$-depolarize the cell enough to activate more voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. This activation results in progressive depolarization and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx. The increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ activates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which leads to progressive hyperpolarization and eventual termination of the depolarization. These periodic depolarizations and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases cause periodic tonic contractions of the smooth muscle. When the amplitude of the slow $V_{m}$ waves is sufficient to depolarize the cell to threshold, the ensuing action potentials lead to further $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and phasic contractions.

Oscillations in intracellular ions (other than $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) or molecules may also explain spontaneous electrical activity. For example, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ during an action potential might stimulate $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{Ca}$ exchange and lead to a cyclic increase in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ and thus an increase in the rate of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion by the electrogenic Na-K pump. Alternatively, activation of G protein-coupled receptors may lead to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$, thereby opening the $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ receptor $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R}\right)$ channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 18) and releasing

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ would be self-reinforcing because CICR via RYRs (Fig. 9-15) may propagate through the cell as a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ wave. However, high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ levels inhibit RYR. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2}$-release events ultimately terminate as high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ inhibits RYR, SR $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores become depleted, or re-uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the SR occurs. The $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases may themselves lead to periodic electrical activity by stimulating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated inward currents (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$efflux) and outward currents (e.g., $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux; see below).

## Some smooth muscles contract without action potentials

Whereas generation of an action potential is essential for initiating contraction of skeletal and cardiac muscle, many smooth-muscle cells contract despite being unable to generate an action potential. As discussed above, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ oscillations can lead to tonic contractions in the absence of action potentials. Action potentials usually do not occur in multiunit smooth muscle. For example, in the smooth muscle that regulates the iris of the eye, excitatory neurotransmitters such as norepinephrine and ACh cause a local depolarizationthe junctional potential-which is similar to the end-plate potential in skeletal muscle (see p. 210). Junctional potentials spread electrotonically (i.e., in a graded fashion) throughout the muscle fiber, thereby altering $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ and triggering $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
entry $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through L-type Cav channels. Graded changes in $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ may also modulate-by an unknown mechanism-the activity of the enzyme phospholipase C, which cleaves phosphoinositides to release the intracellular second messengers diacylglycerol (DAG) and $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ (see p. 58). Both second messengers are modulators of contractile force. In the absence of action potentials, some unitary smooth muscle, including some vascular smooth muscle, also contracts as a result of graded $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ changes.

Some smooth-muscle cells contract simply in response to extracellular agonists, with minimal depolarization and negligible $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry from the outside. For example, a neurotransmitter can bind to a receptor, activate a G protein, and-via phospholipase C -lead to the generation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, binding to $\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR.

## In smooth muscle, both entry of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spark activate contraction

Whereas striated muscle has T tubules, smooth muscle has more rudimentary and shallow invaginations of the plasma membrane (see Fig. 9-15) called caveolae (see pp. 42-43). Smooth-muscle cells use three major pathways-not mutually exclusive-for producing the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ that triggers contraction (see Fig. 9-15): (1) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through L-type Cav channels in response to depolarization, (2) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release

from the SR via RYR and $\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels, and (3) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through voltage-independent/store-operated channels.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Entry via Voltage-Gated Channels Whether the smooth-muscle cell responds to graded depolarizations or action potentials, depolarization may produce a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through L-type Cav channels.
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Release from the SR Sarcoplasmic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release-seen as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks (see pp. 242-243) if sufficiently robust-may occur by either of two mechanisms in smooth muscle: (1) $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through small clusters of the Cav1.2 variant of L-type channels, activating the RYR3 subtype of ryanodine receptors and causing CICR-a robust amplification of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal; and (2) $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ activation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{R} . \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks in various smooth-muscle cells also may occur spontaneously due to random low-probability opening of RYR channels. Whereas the rise of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ via CICR is a prominent aspect of cardiac muscle, the receptor-mediated $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ pathway is particularly significant for $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release in smooth muscle.

In smooth muscle, the relationship between the plasma membrane and the SR is not as regular as the triads (see p. 229) and dyads (see pp. 242-243) in striated muscle. At the level of the caveolae, a peripheral SR compartment encircles the invaginating plasma membrane-forming a gap of only 15 nm -facilitating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ diffusion and thus CICR. A larger network of central SR runs along the long axis of the cell, playing greater role in delivering $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to intracellular myofilaments for contraction.

In smooth muscle but not in cardiac muscle, the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ stimulates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated ion channels other than RYR (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels) that participate in repolarization and regulation of contractile tone. (1) N9-10
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Entry through Store-Operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Channels (SOCs) In cells that lack Cav channels-including secretory epithelia, mast cells, and lymphocytes-depletion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from ER storage compartments may trigger $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through the plasma membrane, followed by the active uptake of this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the ER to replenish the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ store. This $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-releaseactivated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ current ( $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{CRAC}}$ ) underlies capacitative $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, also known as store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry (SOCE). Work on lymphocytes has identified three genes that encode the Orai family of SOCs (see Table 6-2, family No. 20 and Fig. 6-20X). (1) N9-13 Missense mutations in the human ORAI1 gene eliminate the $\mathrm{I}_{\mathrm{CRAC}}$ vital for lymphocyte activation, resulting in severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID).

In nonexcitable cells, the Orai channel is under the control of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensing STIM protein in ER membrane (see Fig. 9-15). When ER $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ is depleted, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dissociates from a binding site on the N terminus of STIM, which causes STIM to aggregate in regions of the ER membrane that are closely associated with the plasma membrane. This STIM aggregation then triggers a direct interaction of the cytosolic C terminus of STIM with a coiled-coil domain on the cytosolic C terminus of Orai tetramers. The result is a clustering of Orai tetramers to form active $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane and subsequent refilling of the ER stores. As ER $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ rises, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ again binds to the site on STIM, suppressing STIM aggregation, and halting SOCE.

SOCE is clearly involved in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent regulation of smooth-muscle contraction. Many types of smooth muscle express STIM and Orai proteins. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable channels of the TRP family (see Table 6-2) are also present in smooth muscle and may be involved in SOCE. (1) N9-11

Both $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR and the entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via SOCE are voltage independent. These two mechanisms underlie pharmacomechanical coupling, a form of EC coupling in which intracellular release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is initiated by chemical activators rather than membrane voltage changes. Thus, a variety of drugs, excitatory neurotransmitters, and hormones can induce smooth-muscle contraction by these coupling mechanisms independently of action potential generation, as discussed in the previous section, and also independently of direct changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, as discussed below.

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain activates cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle

As we noted above, because smooth-muscle actin and myosin are not as highly organized as in skeletal and cardiac muscle, smooth muscle does not exhibit striations characteristic of skeletal and cardiac muscle. The actin filaments of smooth muscle are oriented mainly parallel or oblique to the long axis of the cell. Multiple actin filaments are joined at specialized locations in the cell called dense bodies, which contain $\alpha$-actinin and are analogous to the filament-organizing Z lines of striated muscle. Dense bodies are found immediately beneath the cell membrane as well as within the interior of the myocyte. Thick filaments are interspersed among the thin filaments in smooth muscle and are far less abundant than in skeletal or cardiac muscle.

In contrast to the mechanism in striated muscle, an entirely different mechanism controls cross-bridge turnover in smooth muscle, where an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ initiates a slow sequence of biochemical events that ultimately increases the ATPase activity of the myosin (Fig. 9-16). The first step is the binding of four $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions to calmodulin (CaM), which is closely related to troponin C of striated muscle (see p. 233). Next, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ complex activates an enzyme known as myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which in turn phosphorylates the regulatory light chain that is associated with each neck of the dimeric myosin II heavy chain (see pp. 233-234). Phosphorylation of the light chain causes a conformational change of the myosin head, which increases the angle between the head and neck domain of myosin and also increases its ATPase activity, allowing it to interact efficiently with actin and act as a molecular motor. Thus, in smooth muscle, CaM rather than troponin C is the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding protein responsible for transducing the contractiontriggering increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Note that in smooth muscle, contraction cannot begin until MLCK increases the ATPase activity of myosin, which is a relatively slow, time-dependent process. In skeletal and cardiac muscle, on the other hand, the ATPase activity of the myosin head is constitutively high, and cross-bridge cycling begins as soon as tropomyosin moves out of the way.

# N9-10 STOCs and STICs in Smooth Muscle 

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Simultaneous imaging of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spark events and electrophysiological recording from smooth-muscle cells has further revealed that individual $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release spark events are often coupled to electrical signals at the plasma membrane known as STOCs (spontaneous transient outward currents) and STICs (spontaneous transient inward currents). STOCs and STICs are produced, respectively, by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels at the plasma membrane that are directly activated by the pulse of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from SR stores by spark events (see Fig. 9-15).
$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the smooth-muscle plasma membrane include $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels activated both by $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and positive voltage as well as SK and IK channels activated by intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM. Close reciprocal coupling between intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release and activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, particularly $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, is recognized as an important negative-feedback mechanism for control of excitability, contraction, and smooth-muscle tone, a term that describes the underlying state of contractile tension. Membrane hyperpolarization mediated by opening of $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels is a negative-feedback response that protects smooth muscle from excessive excitation and contraction.

In most smooth-muscle cells, the Nernst potential for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\left(E_{\mathrm{Cl}}\right)$ is on the order of -20 mV , which is significantly more positive than the typical smooth-muscle cell resting membrane potential of approximately -60 mV . In this situation, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated
opening of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels at membrane potentials more negative than $E_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ will depolarize the cell due to efflux of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(which is equivalent to inward movement of positive charge and physiologically defined as an inward current). $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels of the anoctamin family (see Table 6-2, family No. 17) have recently been identified in smooth muscle, epithelia, and other cells. Inward current due to $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$efflux initiated by agonist-induced activation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3} \mathrm{Rs}$ resulting in a global increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, has been observed in many types of smooth-muscle cells. Since STIC responses depolarize $V_{\mathrm{in}}$, they increase excitability and promote smooth-muscle contraction.

The ultimate consequences of changes in membrane potential, transmitter activation, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ spark signaling in smooth muscle depend on complex interactions of ionic gradients and channels. For example, at very negative values of $V_{\mathrm{in}}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks can augment membrane depolarization by activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$current (STICs). The subsequent rise in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{in}}$ will subsequently activate L-type Cav channels to further enhance depolarization, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, and muscle cell contraction. Eventually the opening of $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels activated by positive voltage and the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, will hyperpolarize the cell, inhibit further $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, and lead to muscle cell relaxation. Complex sequences of such events associated with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sparks, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ waves, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillations underlie the tonic and phasic behavior of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling in smooth muscle.

## N9-11 SOCE in Skeletal Muscle

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

The possible role of SOCE in the physiology of other muscle cell types is also under active investigation. For example, skeletal muscle fibers express both the STIM and Orai proteins. Human mutations in the human ORAI1 gene are associated with congenital myopathy, but the exact function of the gene product in
muscle is unclear. Hypothetical proposed roles for plasma membrane entry of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by the SOCE mechanism in skeletal muscle include supplementation of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for activation of contraction, balancing of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and depletion, and regulation of protein function at the triad junction.

## N9-13 Store-Operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Channels (SOCs)

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boran

Receptor-operated and store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are defined not by the structure of the channel but by their apparent physiological regulation.

Receptor-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (ROCs)—also called "second messenger-operated channels"-mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry in response to stimulation of a $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{q}}$ protein-coupled receptor (see Table 3-2) or a receptor tyrosine kinase (see p. 68) and subsequent increase in the activity of phospholipase C (see p. 58), such as PLC $\beta$ or PLC $\gamma$.

Store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (SOCs) mediate "capacitative" $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry that is triggered by depletion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ inside the endoplasmic reticulum. Thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of the endoplasmic reticulum $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pump or SERCA, can cause depletion of the internal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pool. As discussed on p. 247, one class of SOCs consists of the ORAI channels and their associated STIM proteins.

Although the ORAI channel and STIM proteins comprise a pathway for voltage-independent activation of SOC in smooth muscle, recent evidence suggests that the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable TRP
channels (see Fig. 6-20) as well as p. 169)-TRPC1 and TRPCSumay function as SOCs in mammalian portal-vein myocytes. Activation of these latter TRP channels in portal-vein smooth muscle appears to be coupled to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$-mediated release of internal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via mechanisms involving $\alpha 1$-adrenergic receptor activation of a phospholipase C pathway that includes $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, diacylglycerol, protein kinase C, and calmodulin. Further work is clearly needed to investigate the molecular basis of SOC channels in smooth muscle and the physiological functions of human ORAI channels.

Figure 9-16 Role of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in triggering the contraction of smooth muscle.

In addition to activating thick filaments of smooth muscle, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ indirectly acts on the thin filaments to remove the tonic inhibition to actin-myosin interactions that are caused by steric hindrance. Two proteins, caldesmon and calponin, tonically inhibit the interaction between actin and myosin. Both are $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$-binding proteins, and both bind to actin and tropomyosin. Calponin, which is found in a fixed stoichiometry with tropomyosin and actin (one calponin-one tropomyosin-seven actin monomers), tonically inhibits the ATPase activity of myosin. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ complex not only activates MLCK (a CaMK; see p. 60) but also has two effects on calponin. First, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ binds to calponin. Second, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ activates CaMKII, which phosphorylates calponin. Both effects relieve calponin's inhibition of myosin's ATPase activity. Caldesmon is another regulatory protein of smooth muscle that appears to act like calponin by tonically inhibiting the actin-activated ATPase activity of myosin in smooth muscle. Caldesmon contains binding domains for actin, myosin, and tropomyosin, as well as $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$. It appears to block the interaction of actin with myosin; however, the exact mechanism is controversial.

Although the steps of cross-bridge cycling in smooth muscle are similar to those in skeletal and cardiac muscle (see Fig. 9-7), smooth muscle controls the initiation of the cross-bridge cycle differently-at step 2 in Figure 9-7, where $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ confers ATPase activity to the myosin head, as discussed before. Recall that the ATPase activity of striated muscle is always high and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ regulates the access of the myosin head to the actin. Another difference between smooth and striated muscle is that the frequency of crossbridge cycling in smooth muscle is less than one tenth that in skeletal muscle. This variation reflects differences in the properties of myosin isoforms that are expressed in various cell types. Even though cross-bridge cycling occurs less frequently in smooth muscle, force generation may be as great or greater, perhaps because the cross-bridges remain intact for a longer period with each cycle. It is likely that this longer period during which the cross-bridges are intact reflects a lower rate of ADP release from the smooth-muscle isoform of myosin.

## Termination of smooth-muscle contraction requires dephosphorylation of myosin light chain

Because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ triggers smooth-muscle contraction by inducing phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain rather than by simple binding to troponin C as in striated muscle, merely restoring $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to its low resting value does not produce muscle relaxation. Rather, relaxation of smooth muscle requires dephosphorylation of the myosin light chains (MLCs) by myosin light chain phosphatase (MLCP). This phosphatase is a heterotrimer consisting of subunits with molecular masses of 130,20 , and 37 kDa . The $130-\mathrm{kDa}$ subunit confers specificity by binding to myosin; the $37-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein is the catalytic subunit responsible for the dephosphorylating activity.

## Smooth-muscle contraction may also occur independently of increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$

Whereas many excitatory stimuli rely on increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to evoke contraction, some stimuli appear to cause contraction without a measurable increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. One mechanism by which excitatory stimuli might induce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ independent contractions is by modulating the activity of contractile or regulatory proteins directly. Thus, the amount of force developed at any given $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ may vary. This force/ $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ ratio may be increased or decreased and is generally higher during pharmacomechanical activation than during depolarization-activated contractions. Because phosphorylation of the MLC is a major determinant of contractile force in smooth muscle, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent contractions may result either from an increase in the rate of MLC phosphorylation by MLCK or from a decrease in the rate of MLC dephosphorylation by MLCP. One second-messenger system that can decrease the activity of phosphatases is protein kinase C (PKC; see pp. 60-61). Some excitatory stimuli are therefore capable of initiating smooth-muscle contraction by inducing $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$-mediated release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores as well as by producing PKC-mediated decreases in MLCP activity. These pathways are further examples of pharmacomechanical coupling (see p. 247).

## In smooth muscle, increases in both $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of the contractile apparatus enhance contractile force

Unlike skeletal muscle, in which force development results from the summation of individual muscle twitches, individual smooth-muscle cells can maintain a sustained contraction that can be graded in strength over a wide range. Contractile force in smooth muscle largely depends on the relative balance between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of MLCs. The rate of MLC phosphorylation is regulated by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{CaM}$ complex, which in turn depends on levels of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Smooth-muscle cells can regulate $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, over a wider range than skeletal and cardiac muscle for several reasons. First, smooth-muscle cells that do not generate action potentials-but rather exhibit graded $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ responses to neurotransmitters or hormones-are able to fine-tune $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx via voltage-gated channels. Second, release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores may be modulated via neurotransmitter-induced generation of intracellular second messengers such as $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$. This modulation allows finer control of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release than occurs in the $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel by L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in skeletal and cardiac muscle.

A second level of control over contractile force occurs by regulation of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of proteins that regulate contraction. For example, inhibiting MLCP alters the balance between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, in effect allowing a greater contraction at a lower $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Some neurotransmitters act by inhibiting the phosphatase, which appears to occur via activation of G protein-coupled receptors. Another mechanism for governing the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of proteins that regulate contraction is alteration of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of the MLCK. Phosphorylation of MLCK by several protein kinases-including PKA, PKC, and CaMKdecreases the sensitivity of MLCK to activation by the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ CaM complex.

## Smooth muscle maintains high force at low energy consumption

Smooth muscle is often called on to maintain high force for long periods. If smooth muscle consumed ATP at rates similar to those in striated muscle, metabolic demands would be considerable and the muscle would be prone to fatigue. Unlike striated muscle, however, smooth muscle is able to maintain high force at a low rate of ATP hydrolysis. This low energy consumption/high-tension state is referred to as the latch state. The latch state in smooth muscle is unique because high tension can be maintained despite a decrease in the degree of muscle activation by excitatory stimuli. As a result, force is maintained at a lower level of MLCK phosphorylation.

The mechanism underlying the latch state is not entirely known, although it appears to be due in large part to changes in the kinetics of actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and detachment. These changes may be a direct result of a decrease in the rate at which dephosphorylated cross-bridges detach. Tension is directly related to the number of attached cross-bridges. Furthermore, the proportion of myosin heads cross-bridged to actin is related to the ratio of attachment rates to detachment rates. Therefore, it is reasonable to expect that a decrease in the detachment rate would allow a greater number of cross-bridges to be maintained and would result in a lower rate of cross-bridge cycling and ATP hydrolysis. Thus, smooth muscle appears to be able to slow down crossbridge cycling just before detachment, a feat that can be accomplished in skeletal muscle (see Fig. 9-7) only at low ATP levels (as in rigor mortis).

## DIVERSITY AMONG MUSCLES

As we have seen, each muscle type (skeletal, cardiac, and smooth) is distinguishable on the basis of its unique histological features, EC coupling mechanisms, and regulation of contractile function. However, even within each of the three categories, muscle in different locations must serve markedly different purposes, with different demands for strength, speed, and fatigability. This diversity is possible because of differences in the expression of specific isoforms of various contractile and regulatory proteins (see Table 9-1).

## Skeletal muscle is composed of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers

Some skeletal muscles must be resistant to fatigue and be able to maintain tension for relatively long periods, although they need not contract rapidly. Examples are muscles that maintain body posture, such as the soleus muscle of the lower part of the leg. In contrast, some muscles need to contract rapidly, yet infrequently. Examples are the extraocular muscles, which must contract rapidly to redirect the eye as an object of visual interest moves about.

Individual muscle fibers are classified as slow twitch (type I) or fast twitch (type II), depending on their rate of force development. These fiber types are also distinguished by their histological appearance and their ability to resist fatigue.

Slow-twitch fibers (Table 9-2) are generally thinner and have a denser capillary network surrounding them. These type I fibers also appear red because of a large amount of the oxygen-binding protein myoglobin (see pp. 648-649) within the cytoplasm. This rich capillary network together with myoglobin facilitates oxygen transport to the slow-twitch fibers, which mostly rely on oxidative metabolism for energy. The metabolic machinery of the slow-twitch fiber also favors oxidative metabolism because it has low glycogen content and glycolytic-enzyme activity but a rich mitochondrial and oxidative-enzyme content. Oxidative metabolism is slow but efficient, which makes these fibers resistant to fatigue.

Fast-twitch fibers differ among themselves with respect to fatigability. Some fast-twitch fibers are fatigue resistant (type IIa); they rely on oxidative metabolism and are quite similar to slow-twitch fibers with respect to myoglobin content (indeed, they are red) and metabolic machinery. One important difference is that fast-twitch oxidative fibers contain abundant glycogen and have a greater number of mitochondria than slow-twitch fibers do. These features ensure adequate ATP generation to compensate for the increased rate of ATP hydrolysis in fast-twitch fibers.

Other fast-twitch fibers are not capable of sufficient oxidative metabolism to sustain contraction. Because these

TABLE 9-2 Properties of Fast- and Slow-Twitch Muscle Fibers

|  | SLGW <br> TWITCH | FAST <br> TWITCH | FAST <br> TWITCH |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Synonym | Type I | Type IIa | Type IIx/IIb |
| Fatigue | Resistant | Resistant | Fatigable |
| Color | Red <br> (myoglobin) | Red <br> (myoglobin) | White (low <br> myoglobin) |
| Metabolism | Oxidative | Oxidative | Glycolytic |
| Mitochondria | High | Higher | Fewer |
| Glycogen | Low | Abundant | High |

fibers must rely on the energy that is stored within glycogen (and phosphocreatine), they are more easily fatigable. Fatigable fast-twitch fibers (type IIx/IIb) have fewer mitochondria and lower concentrations of myoglobin and oxidative enzymes. Because of their low myoglobin content, type IIb muscle fibers appear white. They are, however, richer in glycolytic-enzyme activity than other fiber types are.

In reality, slow- and fast-twitch fibers represent the extremes of a continuum of muscle fiber characteristics. Moreover, each whole muscle is composed of fibers of each twitch type, with one twitch type predominating. The differences between fiber types derive in large part from differences in isoform expression of the various contractile and regulatory proteins (see Table 9-1).

Differences in the rate of contraction, for example, may be directly correlated with the maximal rate of myosin ATPase activity. The human genome database lists 15 MYH genes that encode myosin heavy chains (MHCs). Expression of these genes and their splice variants differs among muscle types and with stage of development. Skeletal muscle expresses at least six MYH genes (MYH1 to MYH4, MYH8, MYH13). For the most part, a muscle fiber type expresses a single MHC type, the ATPase activity of which appears to correspond to the rate of contraction in that fiber type. Whereas most fibers express one MHC type, some fibers express a combination of two different types. These hybrid cells have rates of contraction that are intermediate between the two pure fiber types.

Differences in the rates and strength of contraction may also reflect differences in expression of types of myosin light chains or other components of the EC coupling, such as the SR Ca pump (i.e., the SERCA), calsequestrin, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release channels, and troponin C (see Table 9-1). Furthermore, some regulatory proteins, such as phospholamban, are expressed in certain muscle types (i.e., slow-twitch skeletal, cardiac, smooth) and not the others.

One particularly interesting feature of muscle differentiation is that fiber-type determination is not static. Through exercise training or changes in patterns of neuronal stimulation, alterations in contractile and regulatory protein isoform expression may occur. For example, it is possible for a greater proportion of fast-twitch fibers to develop in a specific muscle with repetitive training. It is even possible to induce cardiac-specific isoforms in skeletal muscle, given appropriate stimulation patterns.

## The properties of cardiac cells vary with location in the heart

Just as skeletal muscle consists of multiple fiber types, so too does heart muscle. The electrophysiological and mechanical properties of cardiac muscle vary with their location (i.e., atria versus conducting system versus ventricles). Moreover, even among cells within one anatomical location, functional differences may exist between muscle cells near the surface of the heart (epicardial cells) and those lining the interior of the same chambers (endocardial cells). As in skeletal muscle, many of these differences reflect differences in isoform expression of the various contractile and regulatory proteins. Although some of the protein isoforms expressed in cardiac tissue are identical to those expressed in skeletal muscle, many of the proteins have cardiac-specific isoforms (see Table 9-1). The MHC in heart, for example, exists in two isoforms, $\alpha$ and $\beta$, which may be expressed alone or in combination.

## The properties of smooth-muscle cells differ markedly among tissues and may adapt with time

When one considers that smooth muscle has a broad range of functions, including regulating the diameter of blood vessels, propelling food through the gastrointestinal tract, regulating the diameter of airways, and delivering a newborn infant from the uterus, it is not surprising that smooth muscle is a particularly diverse type of muscle. In addition to being distinguished as unitary or multiunit muscle (see p. 243), smooth muscle in different organs diverges with respect to nerve and hormonal control, electrical activity, and characteristics of contraction.

Even among smooth-muscle cells within the same sort of tissue, important functional differences may exist. For example, vascular smooth-muscle cells within the walls of two arterioles that perfuse different organs may vary in their contractile response to various stimuli. Differences may even exist between vascular smooth-muscle cells at two different points along one arterial pathway.

The phenotype of smooth muscle within a given organ may change with shifting demands. The uterus, for example, is composed of smooth muscle-the myometrium (see Fig. 56-2)-that undergoes remarkable transformation during gestation as it prepares for parturition. In addition to hypertrophy, greater coupling develops between smooth-muscle cells via the increased formation of gap junctions. The cells also undergo changes in their expression of contractile protein isoforms. Changes in the expression of ion channels and hormone receptors facilitate rhythmic electrical activity. This activity is coordinated across the myometrium by propagation of action potentials and increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ via the gap junctions. These rhythmic, coordinated contractions develop spontaneously, but they are strongly influenced by the hormone oxytocin, levels of which increase just before and during labor and just after parturition.

These differences in smooth-muscle function among various tissues or even over the lifetime of a single cell probably reflect differences in protein composition. Indeed, in comparison to striated muscle, smooth-muscle cells express a wider variety of isoforms of contractile and regulatory

proteins (see Table 9-1). This variety is a result of both multiple genes and variability among mRNA products of a gene (see pp. 96-97). This richness in diversity is likely to have important consequences for smooth-muscle cell function.

## Smooth-muscle cells express a wide variety of neurotransmitter and hormone receptors

Perhaps one of the most impressive sources of diversity among smooth-muscle cells relates to differences in response to neurotransmitters, environmental factors, and circulating hormones. Smooth-muscle cells differ widely with respect to the types of cell-surface receptors that mediate the effects of these various mediators. In general, smooth-muscle cells each express a variety of such receptors, and receptor stimulation may lead to either contraction or relaxation. Many substances act via different receptor subtypes in different cells, and these receptor subtypes may act via different mechanisms. For example, whereas some neurotransmitter/ hormone receptors may be ligand-gated ion channels (e.g., ATP-activated P2X receptor $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel), other receptors
are G protein-coupled receptors (e.g., adrenergic $\beta_{2}$, muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ ) that either act directly on targets or act via intracellular second messengers (e.g., cAMP, cGMP, or $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG).

The list of neurotransmitters (see Table 20-7), hormones (see Table 20-8), and environmental factors (see Table 20-9) regulating the function of vascular smooth-muscle cells alone is vast. Identical stimuli, however, may result in remarkably different physiological responses by smooth muscle in different locations. For example, systemic arterial smooth-muscle cells relax when the oxygen concentration around them decreases, whereas pulmonary arterial smooth muscle contracts when local oxygen concentration decreases (see p. 687).

A summary comparison among muscle types is presented in Table 9-3.

# ORGANIZATION OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM 

Bruce R. Ransom

The human brain is the most complex tissue in the body. It mediates behavior ranging from simple movements and sensory perception to learning, memory, and consciousness. It is the organ of the mind and accounts for the human capacity for invention, discovery, and language. Many of the brain's functions are poorly understood. In fact, the most prominent function of the human brain, its capacity to think, is hardly understood at all. Its capacity to reflect upon itself is a philosophical paradox. Our lack of knowledge about fundamental aspects of brain function stands in marked contrast to the level of comprehension that we have about the primary functions of other organ systems such as the heart, lungs, and kidneys. Nevertheless, tremendous strides have been made in the past few decades.

In this part of the book, we present the physiology of the nervous system in a manner that is intended to be complementary to texts on neurobiology and neuroanatomy. In this chapter, we review the basic cellular, developmental, and gross anatomy of the nervous system. In Chapter 11, we discuss the fluid environment of the neurons in the brain, how this environment interacts with the rest of the extracellular fluid of the body, and the role of glial cells. Chapters 12 and 13 focus on the broad physiological principles that underlie how the brain's cellular elements operate. Another major goal of this section is to provide more detailed information on those parts of the nervous system that play key roles in the physiology of other systems in the body. Thus, in Chapter 14, we discuss the autonomic nervous system, which controls viscera such as the heart, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract. Finally, in Chapters 15 and 16, we discuss the special senses and simple neuronal circuits.

## The nervous system can be divided into central, peripheral, and autonomic nervous systems

The manner in which the nervous system is subdivided is somewhat arbitrary. All elements of the nervous system work closely together in a way that has no clear boundaries. Nevertheless, the traditional definitions of the subdivisions provide a useful framework for talking about the brain and its connections, and are important if only for that reason.

The central nervous system (CNS) consists of the brain and spinal cord (Table 10-1). It is covered by three "membranes"-the meninges. The outer membrane is the dura mater; the middle is the arachnoid; and the delicate inner
membrane is called the pia mater. Within the CNS, some neurons that share similar functions are grouped into aggregations called nuclei. The CNS can also be divided into gray matter, which contains neuron cell bodies, and white matter, which is rich in myelin (see pp. 199-201).

The peripheral nervous system (PNS) consists of those parts of the nervous system that lie outside the dura mater (see Table 10-1). These elements include sensory receptors for various kinds of stimuli, the peripheral portions of spinal and cranial nerves, and all the peripheral portions of the autonomic nervous system. The sensory nerves that carry messages from the periphery to the CNS are termed afferent nerves (from the Latin ad + ferens [carrying toward]). Conversely, the peripheral motor nerves that carry messages from the CNS to peripheral tissues are called efferent nerves (from the Latin ex + ferens [carrying away]). Peripheral ganglia are groups of nerve cells concentrated into small knots or clumps that are located outside the CNS.

The autonomic nervous system (ANS) is that portion of the nervous system that regulates and controls visceral functions, including heart rate, blood pressure, digestion, temperature regulation, and reproductive function. Although the ANS is a functionally distinct system, it is anatomically composed of parts of the CNS and PNS (see Table 10-1). Visceral control is achieved by reflex arcs that consist of visceral afferent (i.e., sensory) neurons that send messages from the periphery to the CNS, control centers in the CNS that receive this input, and visceral motor output. Moreover, visceral afferent fibers typically travel together with visceral efferent fibers.

## Each area of the nervous system has unique nerve cells and a different function

Nervous tissue is composed of neurons and neuroglial cells. Neurons vary greatly in their structure throughout the nervous system, but they all share certain features that tailor them for the unique purpose of electrical communication (see Chapter 12). Neuroglial cells, often simply called glia, are not primary signaling cells and have variable structures that are suited for their diverse functions (see Chapter 11).

The human brain contains $\sim 10^{11}$ neurons and slightly more glial cells. Each of these neurons may interact with thousands of other neurons, which helps explain the awesome complexity of the nervous system.
