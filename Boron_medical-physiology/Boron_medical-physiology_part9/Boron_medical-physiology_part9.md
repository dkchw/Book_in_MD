# ORGANIZATION OF ENDOCRINE CONTROL 

Eugene J. Barrett

With the development of multicellular organisms that have specialized tissues and organs, two major systems evolved to communicate and coordinate body functions:

1. The nervous system integrates tissue functions by a network of cells and cell processes that constitute the nervous system and all subdivisions, as discussed in Chapters 10 through 16.
2. The endocrine system integrates organ function via chemicals that are secreted from endocrine tissues or "glands" into the extracellular fluid. These chemicals, called hormones, are then carried through the blood to distant target tissues where they are recognized by specific high-affinity receptors. As discussed in Chapter 3, these receptors may be located either on the surface of the target tissue, within the cytosol, or in the target cell's nucleus. These receptor molecules allow the target cell to recognize a unique hormonal signal from among the numerous chemicals that are carried through the blood and bathe the body's tissues. The accuracy and sensitivity of this recognition are remarkable in view of the very low concentration $\left(10^{-9}\right.$ to $\left.10^{-12} \mathrm{M}\right)$ at which many hormones circulate.

Once a hormone is recognized by its target tissue or tissues, it can exert its biological action by a process known as signal transduction (see Chapter 3). Here in Chapter 47, we discuss how the signal-transduction cascades couple the hormone to its appropriate end responses. Some hormones elicit responses within seconds (e.g., the increased heart rate provoked by epinephrine or the stimulation of hepatic glycogen breakdown caused by glucagon), whereas others may require many hours or days (e.g., the changes in salt retention elicited by aldosterone or the increases in protein synthesis caused by growth hormone [GH]). We also examine the principles underlying the feedback mechanisms that control endocrine function.

In Chapters 48 through 52, we see how the principles introduced in this chapter apply to some specific endocrine systems.

## PRINCIPLES OF ENDOCRINE FUNCTION

Chemical signaling can occur through endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine pathways

As shown in Figure 3-1A, in classic endocrine signaling, a hormone carries a signal from a secretory gland across a
large distance to a target tissue. Hormones secreted into the extracellular space can also regulate nearby cells without ever passing through the systemic circulation. This regulation is referred to as paracrine action of a hormone (see Fig. 3-1B). Finally, chemicals can also bind to receptors on or in the cell that is actually secreting the hormone and thus affect the function of the hormone-secreting cell itself. This action is referred to as autocrine regulation (see Fig. 3-1C). All three mechanisms are illustrated for individual endocrine systems in subsequent chapters. At the outset, it can be appreciated that summation of the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions of a hormone can provide the framework for a complex regulatory system.

Endocrine Glands The major hormones of the human body are produced by one of seven classic endocrine glands or gland pairs: the pituitary, the thyroid, the parathyroids, the testes, the ovaries, the adrenals (cortex and medulla), and the endocrine pancreas. In addition, other tissues that are not classically recognized as part of the endocrine system produce hormones and play a vital role in endocrine regulation. These tissues include the central nervous system (CNS), particularly the hypothalamus, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, liver, heart, and kidney.

In some circumstances, particularly with certain neoplasms, nonendocrine tissues can produce hormones that are usually thought to be made only by endocrine glands (Box 47-1).

Paracrine Factors Numerous specialized tissues that are not part of the classic endocrine system release "factors" into the extracellular fluid that can signal neighboring cells to effect a biological response. The interleukins, or lymphokines, are an example of such paracrine factors, as are several of the growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor, and others. These factors are not hormones in the usual sense. They are not secreted by glandular tissue, and their sites of action are usually (but not always) within the local environment. However, these signaling molecules share many properties of the classic peptide and amine hormones in that they bind to surface receptors and regulate one or more of the specific intracellular signaling mechanisms described in Chapter 3.

The distinction between the hormones of the classic endocrine systems and other biologically active secreted peptides blurs even further in the case of neuropeptides. For example, the hormone somatostatin, a 28 -amino-acid

## BOX 47-1 Neoplastic Hormone Production

The ability of nonendocrine tissue to produce hormones first became apparent with the description of clinical syndromes in which some patients with lung cancer were found to make excessive amounts of AVP, a hormone usually made by the hypothalamus. Shortly afterward, people with other lung or gastrointestinal tumors were found to make ACTH, which is normally made only in the pituitary. Subsequently, many hormone-secreting neoplastic tissues were described. As the ability to measure hormones in tissues has improved and, in particular, as the capability of measuring mRNA that codes for specific peptide hormones has developed, it has become clear that hormone production by neoplastic tissue is quite common, although most tumors produce only small amounts that may have no clinical consequence.

The production of hormones by nonendocrine neoplastic cells has been most clearly defined for cancers of the lung. Several different types of lung cancer occur, each deriving from a different cell line, and yet each is capable of producing one or several hormones. The clinical syndromes that result from secretion of these hormones are often called paraneoplastic syndromes. Thus, lung cancers arising from squamous cells are sometimes associated with hypercalcemia, which results from the secretion of a protein-parathyroid hormone-related peptide-that can mimic the activity of PTH (see p. 1069). Small-cell lung cancers are notorious for their ability to secrete numerous hormones, including AVP (with resultant hyponatremia; see Box 38-3), ACTH (with resultant Cushing syndrome; see Box 50-1), and many others. Still other types of lung cancer produce other paraneoplastic syndromes.

Nearly all these ectopic, neoplastic sources of hormone produce peptide hormones. Other sources of hormone production, in addition to lung cancer, include gastrointestinal tumors, renal and bladder cancer, neural tumors, unique tumors called carcinoid tumors that can arise almost anywhere in the body, and even lymphomas and melanomas. In some patients, the symptoms and signs resulting from ectopic hormone production may appear before any other reason exists to suspect an underlying neoplasm, and these symptoms may be the key clues to the correct diagnosis.

peptide secreted by the $\delta$ cells of the pancreatic islet, acts in paracrine fashion on other islet cells to regulate insulin and glucagon secretion (see p. 1053). However, somatostatin is also made by hypothalamic neurons. Nerve terminals in the hypothalamus release somatostatin into the pituitary portal bloodstream (see pp. 993-994). This specialized segment of the circulatory system then carries the somatostatin from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary, where it inhibits the secretion of GH. Somatostatin in the hypothalamus is one of several neuropeptides that bridge the body's two major communication systems.

## Hormones may be peptides, metabolites of single amino acids, or metabolites of cholesterol

Although the chemical nature of hormones is diverse, most commonly recognized mammalian hormones can be grouped into one of several classes. Table 47-1 is a list of many of the recognized classic mammalian hormones, which
are divided into three groups based on their chemical structure and how they are made in the body.

Peptide hormones include a large group of hormones made by a variety of endocrine tissues. Insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin are made in the pancreas. The pituitary gland makes GH; the two gonadotropin hormones, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH); adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH); thyrotropin (also called thyroid-stimulating hormone or TSH); and prolactin (PRL). The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH), and the thyroid gland make calcitonin.

In addition, other peptide hormones, such as somatostatin and several releasing hormones (e.g., growth hormonereleasing hormone [GHRH]), are made by the hypothalamus. Secretin, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and other hormones are made by the gastrointestinal tract, which is not considered a classic endocrine gland.

The synthesis of catecholamines (from tyrosine) and steroid hormones (from cholesterol) requires a number of

enzymes present in only very specialized tissues. Synthesis of thyroid hormone is even more complex and is essentially restricted to the thyroid gland.

Several glands make two or more hormones. Examples are the pituitary, the pancreatic islets, and the adrenal glands. However, for the most part, individual cells within these glands are specialized to secrete a single hormone. One exception is the gonadotropin-producing cells of the pituitary, which secrete both FSH and LH.

## Hormones can circulate either free or bound to carrier proteins

Once secreted, many hormones circulate freely in the blood until they reach their target tissue. Others form complexes with circulating binding protein; this use of binding proteins is particularly applicable for thyroid hormones (thyroxine $\left[\mathrm{T}_{4}\right]$ and triiodothyronine $\left[\mathrm{T}_{3}\right]$ ), steroid hormones, insulin-like growth factor types 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), and GH.

Formation of a complex between a hormone and a circulating binding protein serves several functions. First, it provides the blood with a reservoir or pool of the hormone and thus minimizes minute-to-minute fluctuations in hormone concentration. Second, it extends the half-life of the hormone in the circulation. For example, $>99.99 \%$ of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ circulates bound to one of three binding proteins (see pp. 1008-1009); the half-life of circulating bound $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is 7 to 8 days, whereas the half-life of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is only several minutes. The hormones bound to plasma binding proteins appear to be those whose actions are long term-in particular, those involving induction of the synthesis of new protein in target tissues. Hormones that play a major short-term role in the regulation of body metabolism (e.g., catecholamines, many peptide hormones) circulate freely without associated binding proteins.

The presence of plasma binding proteins can affect the total circulating concentration of a hormone without necessarily affecting the concentration of unbound or free hormone in the blood. For example, during pregnancy the liver's synthesis of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$-binding globulin increases. Because this protein avidly binds $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, the free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ concentration ordinarily would fall. However, the pituitary senses the small decline in free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ levels and secretes more TSH. As a result, the thyroid makes more $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, so plasma levels of total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ rise. However, the free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ level does not rise.

## Immunoassays allow measurement of circulating hormones

In the late 1950s, Solomon Berson and Rosalyn Yalow demonstrated that patients who receive insulin form antibodies directed against the insulin molecule. This observation was important in two respects:

1. It advanced the principle that the body's immune system can react to endogenous compounds; therefore, autoimmunity or reaction to self-antigens does occur. This notion is a fundamental tenet of our current understanding of many autoimmune diseases, among which are endocrine diseases such as type 1 diabetes mellitus, autoimmune hypothyroidism, Graves disease (a common form of autoimmune hyperthyroidism), and Addison disease (one form of adrenal insufficiency). Before the description of insulin autoantibodies, it was thought that the immune system simply did not react to self-antigens.
2. Because antibodies with a high affinity for insulin were induced in patients who were treated with insulin, Berson and Yalow reasoned that these antibodies could be used to measure the amount of insulin in serum. Figure 47-1 illustrates the principle of a radioimmunoassay and how it is used to measure the concentration of a hormone (or other chemicals). If we incubate increasing amounts of a radiolabeled hormone with an antibody to that hormone, the quantity of labeled hormone that is bound to the antibody yields a saturation plot (see Fig. 47-1A). If we now add unlabeled hormone to the incubation mixture, less radioactively labeled hormone remains complexed to the antibody as unlabeled hormone takes its place. The more unlabeled hormone we add, the less labeled hormone is bound to the antibody (see Fig. 47-1B). A displacement curve is created by plotting the amount of radioactively labeled hormone complexed to the antibody as a function of the concentration of unlabeled hormone that is added (see Fig. 47-1C). This displacement curve can then be used as a standard curve to estimate the amount of hormone present in unknown samples. This estimate is accurate only if two assumptions hold true: first, that nothing else in the unknown mixture binds with the antibody other than the hormone under study, and second, that nothing in the unknown sample interferes with normal binding of the hormone to the antibody.

Antibodies that are highly specific for the chemical structure of interest can frequently be obtained. Moreover, these antibodies are of sufficiently high affinity to bind even the often minute amounts of hormone that is circulating in blood. Thus, radioimmunoassays-and recent adaptations that substitute chemiluminescent or enzymatic detection for radioactivity-have emerged as a potent and popular tool. Immunoassays are now used for the measurement of virtually all hormones, as well as many drugs, viruses, and toxins. Much of our understanding of the physiology of hormone secretion and action has been gained by the use of immunoassay methodology. Yalow shared the 1977 Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology for the discovery of the radioimmunoassay (Berson died before the honor was bestowed). (○) N47-1

## Hormones can have complementary and antagonistic actions

Regulation of many complex physiological functions necessitates the complementary action of several hormones. This principle is true both for minute-to-minute homeostasis and for more long-term processes. For example, epinephrine (adrenaline), cortisol, and glucagon each contribute to the body's response to a short-term bout of exercise (e.g., swimming the $50-\mathrm{m}$ butterfly or running the $100-\mathrm{m}$ dash). If any of these hormones is missing, exercise performance is adversely affected, and even more seriously, severe hypoglycemia and hyperkalemia (elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$) may develop. On a longer time scale, GH, insulin, IGF-1, thyroid hormone,

and sex steroids are all needed for normal growth. Deficiency of GH, IGF-1, or thyroid hormone results in dwarfism. Deficiency of sex steroids, cortisol, or insulin produces less severe disturbances of growth.

Integration of hormone action can also involve hormones that exert antagonistic actions. In this case, the overall effect on an end organ depends on the balance between opposing influences. One example is the counterpoised effects of insulin and glucagon on blood glucose levels. Insulin lowers glucose levels by inhibiting glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in the liver and by stimulating glucose uptake into muscle and adipose tissue. Glucagon, in contrast, stimulates hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Whereas glucagon does not appear to directly antagonize glucose uptake by muscle or fat, epinephrine (which, like glucagon, is released in response to hypoglycemia) does. Balancing of tissue function by opposing humoral effector mechanisms appears to be an important regulatory strategy for refining the control of many cellular functions.

## Endocrine regulation occurs through feedback control

The key to any regulatory system is its ability to sense when it should increase or decrease its activity. For the endocrine system, this function is accomplished by feedback control of hormone secretion (Fig. 47-2A). The hormone-secreting cell functions as a "sensor" that continually monitors the circulating concentration of some regulated variable. This variable may be a metabolic factor (e.g., glucose concentration) or the activity of another hormone. When the endocrine gland senses that too much (or too little) of the regulated variable is circulating in blood, it responds by decreasing (or increasing) the rate of hormone secretion. This response in turn affects the metabolic or secretory behavior of the target tissue, which may either directly feed back to the sensing cell or stimulate some other cell that eventually signals the sensor regarding whether the altered function of the endocrine gland has been effective.

![bo046000512f](bo046000512f.jpg)

Figure 47-2 Feedback control of hormone secretion. A, A sensor (e.g., a $\beta$ cell in a pancreatic islet) detects some regulated variable (e.g., plasma [glucose]) and responds by modulating its secretion of a hormone (e.g., insulin). This hormone, in turn, acts on target 1 (e.g., liver or muscle) to modulate its production of another hormone or a metabolite (e.g., reducing [glucose]), which may affect target 2 (e.g., making less glucose available to the brain). In addition, the other hormone or metabolite feeds back on the original sensor cell. B, Under the influence of the cerebral cortex, the hypothalamus releases CRH, which stimulates the anterior pituitary to release ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. The cortisol acts on a number of effector organs. In addition, the cortisol feeds back on both the anterior pituitary and the hypothalamus.

A simple example is insulin secretion by the $\beta$ cells of the pancreas. Increases in plasma [glucose] are sensed by the $\beta$ cell, which secretes insulin in response. The rise in plasma [insulin] acts on the liver to decrease the synthesis of glucose and on the muscle to promote the storage of glucose. As a result, plasma [glucose] falls, and this decrease is sensed by the $\beta$ cell, which reduces the rate of insulin secretion. This arrangement represents a very simple feedback system. Other systems can be quite complex; however, even this simple system involves the recognition of two circulating signals. The liver and muscle recognize the increase in plasma [insulin] as one signal, and the pancreatic $\beta$ cell (the cell responsible for insulin secretion) recognizes the signal of a rise or decline in blood [glucose] as the other signal. In each case, the sensing system within a particular tissue is linked to an effector system that transduces the signal to the appropriate biological response.

## Endocrine regulation can involve hierarchic levels of control

Faced with a stress (e.g., a severe infection or extensive blood loss), the cerebral cortex stimulates the hypothalamus to release a neuropeptide called corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; see Fig. 47-2B). Carried by the pituitary portal system (blood vessels that connect the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary), CRH stimulates the anterior pituitary to release another hormone, ACTH, which in turn stimulates the adrenal cortical cells to synthesize cortisol. Cortisol regulates vascular tone as well as metabolic and growth functions in a variety of tissues.

This stress response therefore involves the cerebral cortex, specialized neuroendocrine tissue in the hypothalamus, as well as two glands, the pituitary and the adrenal cortex. This hierarchic control is regulated by feedback, just as in the simple feedback between plasma [glucose] and insulin. Within this CRH-ACTH-cortisol axis, feedback can occur at several levels. Cortisol inhibits the production of CRH by the hypothalamus as well as the sensitivity of the pituitary to a standard dose of CRH, which directly reduces ACTH release.

Feedback in hierarchic endocrine control systems can be quite complex and frequently involves interaction between the CNS and the endocrine system. Other examples are regulation of the female menstrual cycle (see pp.1110-1116) and regulation of GH secretion (see pp. 992-994).

Among the classic endocrine tissues, the pituitary (also known as the hypophysis) plays a special role (Fig. 47-3). Located at the base of the brain, just below the hypothalamus, the pituitary resides within a saddle-shaped cavity called the sella turcica (from the Latin sella [saddle] + turcica [Turkish]), which has bony anterior, posterior, and inferior borders and fibrous tissue that separate it from venous sinuses on either side. The human pituitary is composed of both an anterior lobe and a posterior lobe. Through vascular and neural connections, the pituitary bridges and integrates neural and endocrine mechanisms of homeostasis. The pituitary is a highly vascular tissue. The posterior pituitary receives arterial blood, whereas the anterior pituitary receives only portal venous inflow from the median eminence. The pituitary portal system is particularly important in carrying neuropeptides from the hypothalamus and pituitary stalk to the anterior pituitary.

## The anterior pituitary regulates reproduction, growth, energy metabolism, and stress responses

Glandular tissue in the anterior lobe of the pituitary synthesizes and secretes six peptide hormones: GH, TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, and PRL. In each case, secretion of these hormones is under the control of hypothalamic releasing hormones (Table 47-2). The sources of these releasing hormones are small-diameter neurons located mainly in the "periventricular" portion of the hypothalamus that surrounds the third ventricle (see pp. 275-277). These small-diameter neurons synthesize the releasing hormones and discharge them into the median eminence and neural stalk, where they enter leaky capillaries-which are not part of the blood-brain barrier (see pp. 284-287). The releasing hormones then travel via the pituitary portal veins to the anterior pituitary.

GnRH, gonadotropin-releasing hormone; OT, oxytocin.

Once in the anterior pituitary, a releasing factor (e.g., GHRH) stimulates specialized cells to release a particular peptide hormone (e.g., GH) into the systemic bloodstream. The integrative function of the anterior pituitary can be appreciated by realizing that the main target for four of the anterior pituitary hormones (i.e., TSH, ACTH, and LH/FSH) is other endocrine tissue. Thus, these four anterior pituitary hormones are themselves "releasing hormones" that trigger the secretion of specific hormones. For example, TSH causes the follicular cells in the thyroid gland to synthesize and release thyroid hormones. The mechanism by which the pituitary regulates these endocrine glands is discussed in detail in Chapters 48 through 50.

GH also acts as a releasing factor in that it regulates the production of another hormone, IGF-1. IGF-1 is made in principally nonendocrine tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, muscle, and cartilage). Nevertheless, IGF-1 in the circulation feeds back on the hypothalamus to decrease GHRH level and on the pituitary to inhibit GH secretion. In this respect, the GH-IGF-1 axis is similar to axes involving classic pituitary pathways, such as the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-TSH axis.

Regulation of PRL secretion differs from that of other anterior pituitary hormones in that no endocrine feedback mechanism has yet been identified. In humans, the pituitary secretes PRL at relatively low levels throughout life. However, its major biological action is important only in women during lactation. Although PRL is not part of an identified feedback system, its release is controlled. Left to its own devices, the anterior pituitary would secrete high levels of PRL. However, secretion of PRL is normally inhibited by the release of dopamine (DA) from the hypothalamus (see
pp. 993-994). During breast stimulation, neural afferents inhibit hypothalamic DA release, thus inhibiting release of the inhibitor and permitting lactation to proceed. PRL receptors are present on multiple tissues other than the breast. However, other physiological actions beyond lactation have not been well characterized.

## The posterior pituitary regulates water balance and uterine contraction

Unlike the anterior pituitary, the posterior lobe of the pituitary is actually part of the brain. The posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis) contains the nerve endings of largediameter neurons whose cell bodies are in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (see Fig. 47-3). Recall that the hypothalamic neurons that produce releasing factors, which act on "troph" cells in the anterior pituitary, are small-diameter neurons. The large-diameter hypothalamic neurons synthesize arginine vasopressin (AVP) and oxytocin and then transport these hormones along their axons to the site of release in the posterior pituitary. Thus, like the anterior pituitary, the posterior pituitary releases peptide hormones. Also as in the anterior pituitary, release of these hormones is under ultimate control of the hypothalamus. However, the hypothalamic axons traveling to the posterior pituitary replace both the transport of releasing factors by the portal system of the anterior pituitary and the synthesis of hormones by the anterior pituitary "troph" cells. Although the posterior pituitary is part of the brain, it is one of the so-called circumventricular organs (see pp. 284-285) whose vessels breach the blood-brain barrier and allow the secreted AVP and oxytocin to reach the systemic circulation.

![bo056000512f](bo056000512f.jpg)

Figure 47-3 Hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The pituitary (or hypophysis) is actually two glands-an anterior pituitary and a posterior pituitary (or neurohypophysis). Although in both cases the hypothalamus controls the secretion of hormones by the pituitary, the mechanisms are very different. Anterior pituitary: Small-bodied neurons in the hypothalamus secrete releasing and inhibitory factors into a rich, funnel-shaped plexus of capillaries that penetrates the median eminence and surrounds the infundibular recess. The cell bodies of these neurons are in several nuclei that surround the third ventricle. These include the arcuate nucleus, the paraventricular and ventromedial nuclei, and the medial preoptic and periventricular regions. The capillaries (primary plexus), which are outside of the blood-brain barrier, coalesce into long portal veins that carry the releasing and inhibitory factors down the pituitary stalk to the anterior pituitary. Other neurons secrete their releasing factors into a capillary plexus that is much further down the pituitary stalk; short portal veins carry these releasing factors to the anterior pituitary. There, the portal veins break up into the secondary capillary plexus of the anterior pituitary and deliver the releasing and inhibitory factors to the "troph" cells that actually secrete the anterior pituitary hormones (GH, TSH, ACTH, LH, FSH, and PRL) that enter the systemic bloodstream and distribute throughout the body. Posterior pituitary: Large neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus actually synthesize the hormones AVP and oxytocin (OT). These hormones travel down the axons of the hypothalamic neurons to the posterior pituitary, where the nerve terminals release the hormones, like neurotransmitters, into a rich plexus of vessels.

AVP (or antidiuretic hormone, ADH) is a neuropeptide hormone that acts on the collecting duct of the kidney to increase water reabsorption (see pp. 817-820). Oxytocin (OT) is the other neuropeptide secreted by the posterior pituitary. However, its principal biological action relates to stimulation of smooth-muscle contraction by the uterus during parturition (see pp. 1145-1146) and by the mammary gland during suckling (see p. 1150).

These two posterior pituitary hormones appear to have a common ancestor—vasotocin-in amphibians and other submammalian species. The two peptide hormones secreted by the posterior pituitary are each made by hypothalamic neurons as a precursor molecule that is transported along the axons of the hypothalamic neurons to the posterior pituitary. For AVP, this precursor protein is proneurophysin II (see p. 845 and Fig. 40-8), whereas for oxytocin it is proneurophysin I. In each case, cleavage of the precursor occurs during transport along the axons from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary. At the time that the active neurohormone (e.g., AVP) is secreted, its residual neurophysin is co-secreted stoichiometrically. Defects in the processing of the neurophysin precursor can lead to impaired secretion of active hormone. In the case of AVP, the result is partial or complete diabetes insipidus.

## PEPTIDE HORMONES

## Specialized endocrine cells synthesize, store, and secrete peptide hormones

Organisms as primitive as fungi secrete proteins or peptides in an effort to respond to and affect their environment. In more complex organisms, peptide hormones play important developmental and other regulatory roles. Transcription of peptide hormones is regulated by both cis- and trans-acting elements (see p. 78). When transcription is active, the mRNA is processed in the nucleus and the capped message moves to the cytosol, where it associates with ribosomes on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. These peptides are destined for secretion because an amino-acid signal sequence (see p. 28) present near the N terminus targets the protein to the endoplasmic reticulum while the protein is still associated with the ribosome.

With minor modification, the secretory pathway illustrated in Figure 2-18 can describe the synthesis, processing, storage, and secretion of peptides by a wide variety of endocrine tissues. Once the protein is in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, processing (e.g., glycosylation or further proteolytic cleavage) yields the mature, biologically active hormone. This processing occurs in a very dynamic setting. The protein is first transferred to the cis-Golgi domain, then through to the trans-Golgi domain, and finally to the membrane-bound secretory vesicle or granule in which the mature hormone is stored before secretion. This pathway is referred to as the regulated pathway of hormone synthesis because external stimuli can trigger the cell to release hormone that is stored in the secretory granule as well as to increase synthesis of additional hormone. For example, binding of GHRH to somatotrophs causes them to release GH.

A second pathway of hormone synthesis is the constitutive pathway. Here, secretion occurs more directly from the endoplasmic reticulum or vesicles formed in the cis Golgi. Secretion of hormone, both mature and partially processed, by the constitutive pathway is less responsive to secretory stimuli than is secretion by the regulated pathway.

In both the regulated and constitutive pathways, fusion of the vesicular membrane with the plasma membraneexocytosis of the vesicular contents-is the final common pathway for hormone secretion. In general, the regulated pathway is capable of secreting much larger amounts of hormone-on demand-than is the constitutive pathway. However, even when stimulated to secrete its peptide hormone, the cell typically secretes only a very small amount of the total hormone present in the secretory granules. To maintain this secretory reserve, many endocrine cells increase the synthesis of peptide hormones in response to the same stimuli that trigger secretion.

## Peptide hormones bind to cell-surface receptors and activate a variety of signal-transduction systems

Once secreted, most peptide hormones exist free in the circulation. As noted above, this lack of binding proteins contrasts with the situation for steroid and thyroid hormones, which circulate bound to plasma proteins. IGF-1 and IGF-2

are an exception to this rule: at least six plasma proteins bind these peptide growth factors.

While traversing the circulation, peptide hormones encounter receptors on the surface of target cells. These receptors are intrinsic membrane proteins that bind the hormone with very high affinity (typically, $K_{\mathrm{D}}$ ranges from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$ ). Examples of several types of peptide hormone receptors are shown in Figure 47-4. Each of these receptors has already been introduced in Chapter 3. The primary sequence of most peptide hormone receptors is known from molecular cloning, mutant receptors have been synthesized, and the properties of native and mutant receptors have been compared to assess primary structural requirements for receptor function. Despite this elegant work, too little information is available on the threedimensional structure of these membrane proteins for us to know just how the message that a hormone has bound to the receptor is transmitted to the internal surface of the cell membrane. However, regardless of the details, occupancy of the receptor can activate many different intracellular signaltransduction systems (Table 47-3) that transfer the signal of cell activation from the internal surface of the membrane to intracellular targets. The receptor provides the link between a specific extracellular hormone and the activation of a specific signal-transduction system. We discussed each of these signal-transduction systems in Chapter 3. Here, we briefly review the various signal-transduction systems through which peptide hormones act.

G Proteins Coupled to Adenylyl Cyclase cAMP, the prototypical second messenger, was discovered during an investigation of the action of glucagon on glycogenolysis in the liver. In addition to playing a role in hormone action, cAMP is involved in such diverse processes as lymphocyte activation, mast cell degranulation, and even slime mold aggregation.

As summarized in Figure 47-4A, binding of the appropriate hormone (e.g., PTH) to its receptor initiates a cascade of events (see pp. 56-57): (1) activation of a heterotrimeric G protein ( $\alpha_{s}$ or $\alpha_{i}$ ); (2) activation (by $\alpha_{s}$ ) or inhibition (by $\alpha_{i}$ ) of a membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase; (3) formation of intracellular cAMP from ATP, catalyzed by adenylyl cyclase; (4) binding of cAMP to the enzyme protein kinase A (PKA); (5) separation of the two catalytic subunits of PKA from the two regulatory subunits; (6) phosphorylation of serine and

hasmuch as G proteins are part of the signaling system involved in large numbers of hormone responses, molecular alterations in G proteins could be expected to affect a number of signaling systems. In the disorder pseudohypoparathyroidism, the key defect is an abnormality in a stimulatory $\alpha$ subunit $\left(\alpha_{s}\right)$ of a heterotrimeric $G$ protein. The result is an impairment in the ability of PTH to regulate body calcium and phosphorus homeostasis (see pp. 1058-1063). Patients with this disorder have a low serum calcium level and high serum phosphate level, just like patients whose parathyroid glands have been surgically removed. However, patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism have increased circulating concentrations of PTH; the hormone simply cannot act normally on its target tissue, hence the term pseudohypoparathyroidism. These individuals also have an increased risk of hypothyroidism, as well as of gonadal dysfunction. These additional endocrine deficiencies arise from the same defect in signaling.
threonine residues on a variety of cellular enzymes and other proteins by the free catalytic subunits of PKA that are no longer restrained; and (7) modification of cellular function by these phosphorylations. The activation is terminated in two ways. First, phosphodiesterases in the cell degrade cAMP. Second, serine/threonine-specific phosphoprotein phosphatases can dephosphorylate enzymes and proteins that had previously been phosphorylated by PKA (Box 47-2).

G Proteins Coupled to Phospholipase C As summarized in Figure 47-4B, binding of the appropriate peptide hormone (e.g., AVP) to its receptor initiates the following cascade of events (see pp. 58-61): (1) activation of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{a}}$; (2) activation of a membrane-bound phospholipase C (PLC); and (3) cleavage of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$ by this PLC, with the generation of two signaling molecules, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG).

The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ fork of the pathway includes (4a) binding of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ to a receptor on the cytosolic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum; (5a) release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, which causes $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{;}$to rise by several-fold; and (6a) activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent kinases (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C [PKC]) by the increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$,

![bo066000512f](bo066000512f.jpg)

Figure 47-4 Receptors and downstream effectors for peptide hormones. AC, adenylyl cyclase.

The DAG fork of the pathway includes (4b) allosteric activation of PKC by DAG (the activity of this enzyme is also stimulated by the increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ ); and (5b) phosphorylation of a variety of proteins by PKC, which is activated in the plane of the cell membrane. An example of a hormone whose actions are in part mediated by DAG is TSH.

G Proteins Coupled to Phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ As summarized in Figure 47-4C, some peptide hormones (e.g., TRH) activate phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PLA}_{2}\right)$ through the following cascade (see pp. 58-61): (1) activation of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$ or $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{11}$, (2) stimulation of membrane-bound $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ by the activated $\mathrm{G} \alpha$, (3) cleavage of membrane phospholipids by $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ to produce lysophospholipid and arachidonic acid, and (4) conversion-by several enzymes-of arachidonic acid into a variety of biologically active eicosanoids (e.g., prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes).

Guanylyl Cyclase Other peptide hormones (e.g., atrial natriuretic peptide) bind to a receptor (see Fig. 47-4D) that is itself a guanylyl cyclase that converts cytoplasmic GTP to cGMP (see pp. 66-67). In turn, cGMP can activate cGMPdependent kinases, phosphatases, or ion channels.

Receptor Tyrosine Kinases For some peptide hormones, notably insulin and IGF-1 and IGF-2, the hormone receptor (see Fig. 47-4E) itself possesses tyrosine kinase activity (see pp. 68-70). This is also a property of other growth factors, including PDGF and epidermal growth factor. Occupancy of the receptor by the appropriate hormone increases kinase activity. For the insulin and IGF-1 receptor, as well as for others, this kinase autophosphorylates tyrosines within the hormone receptor, as well as substrates within the cytosol, thus initiating a cascade of phosphorylation reactions.

Tyrosine Kinase-Associated Receptors Some peptide hormones (e.g., GH) bind to a receptor that, when occupied, activates a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase (see Fig. 47-4F), such as a member of the JAK (Janus kinase, or just another kinase) family of kinases (see pp. 70-71). As for the receptor tyrosine kinases, activation of these receptor-associated kinases initiates a cascade of phosphorylation reactions.

## AMINE HORMONES

## Amine hormones are made from tyrosine and tryptophan

Four major amine hormones are recognized. The adrenal medulla makes the catecholamine hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine from the amino acid tyrosine (see Fig. 13-8C). These hormones are the principal active amine hormones made by the endocrine system. In addition to acting as a hormone, norepinephrine also serves as a neurotransmitter in the CNS (see p. 312) and in postganglionic sympathetic neurons (see pp. 342-343). Dopamine, which is also synthesized from tyrosine, acts as a neurotransmitter in the CNS (see p. 313); it is synthesized in other tissues, but its functional role outside the nervous system is not well clarified. Finally, the hormone serotonin is made from tryptophan (see Fig. 13-8B) by endocrine cells that are located
within the gut mucosa. Serotonin appears to act locally to regulate both motor and secretory function in the gut, and also acts as a neurotransmitter in the CNS (see pp. 312-313).

The human adrenal medulla secretes principally epinephrine (see pp. 1030-1033). The final products are stored in vesicles called chromaffin granules. Secretion of catecholamines by the adrenal medulla appears to be mediated entirely by stimulation of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (see p. 343). Unlike the situation for many peptide hormones, in which the circulating concentration of the hormone (e.g., TSH) negatively feeds back on secretion of the releasing hormone (e.g., TRH), the amine hormones do not have such a hierarchic feedback system. Rather, the feedback of amine hormones is indirect. The higher control center does not sense circulating levels of the amine hormones (e.g., epinephrine) but rather a physiological end effect of that amine hormone (e.g., blood pressure; see pp. 534-536). The sensor of the end effect may be a peripheral receptor (e.g., stretch receptor) that communicates to the higher center (e.g., the CNS), and the efferent limb is the sympathetic outflow that determines release of the amine.

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, or 5-HT), in addition to being an important neurotransmitter in the CNS (see pp. 312-313 and Fig. 13-7B), is a hormone made by neuroendocrine cells, principally located within the lining of the small intestine and larger bronchi. Unlike the other hormones that we discuss in this chapter, serotonin is not made by a specific gland. Little is known about feedback regulation or even regulation of secretion of this hormone. Serotonin arouses considerable clinical interest because of the dramatic clinical presentation of patients with unusual tumors-called carcinoid tumors-of serotonin-secreting cells. Individuals with these tumors frequently present with carcinoid syndrome, characterized by episodes of spontaneous intense flushing in a typical pattern involving the head and neck and associated with diarrhea, bronchospasm, and occasionally right-sided valvular heart disease. The primary tumors involved can occur within the intestinal tract, in the bronchial tree, or more rarely at other sites.

## Amine hormones act via surface receptors

Once secreted, circulating epinephrine is free to associate with specific adrenergic receptors, or adrenoceptors, located on the surface membranes of target cells. Numerous types of adrenoceptors exist and are generically grouped as $\alpha$ or $\beta$, each of which has several subtypes (see Table 14-2). Epinephrine has a greater affinity for $\beta$-adrenergic receptors than for $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors, whereas norepinephrine acts predominantly through $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors. All adrenoceptors that have been isolated from a variety of tissues and species are classic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation occurs through the adenylyl cyclase system. The $\alpha_{2}$ receptor also usually acts through adenylyl cyclase. However, $\alpha_{1}$-adrenergic stimulation is linked to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$, which activates a membrane-associated PLC that liberates $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG. $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ can release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, and DAG directly enhances the activity of PKC. Combined, these actions enhance the cellular activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ dependent kinases, which produce a metabolic response that is characteristic of the specific cell.

![bo076000512f](bo076000512f.jpg)

Figure 47-5 Catecholamine receptors. The $\beta_{1}, \beta_{2}$, and D1 receptors all interact with $G \alpha_{s}$, which activates adenylyl cyclase (AC) and raises levels of cAMP. The $\alpha_{2}$ and D2 receptors interact with $G \alpha_{s}$, which inhibits AC. Additionally, the $\alpha_{1}$ receptor interacts with $G \alpha_{s}$, which activates PLC, which in turn converts phosphoinositides in the cell membrane to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG.

As indicated in Figure 47-5, the intracellular action of a specific catecholamine is determined by the complement of receptors present on the surface of a specific cell. For example, when epinephrine binds to the $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic receptor, it activates a $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ protein, which stimulates adenylyl cyclase, promotes increases in $[\mathrm{cAMP}]_{i}$, and thus enhances the activity of PKA (see Table 14-2). In contrast, when the same hormone binds to a cell displaying principally $\alpha_{2}$ receptors, it activates a $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ protein, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase, diminishes $[\mathrm{cAMP}]_{i}$, and therefore reduces PKA activity. Thus, the response of a specific cell to adrenergic stimulation (whether via circulating epinephrine or via norepinephrine released locally by sympathetic neurons) depends on the receptor repertoire displayed by the cell. As a result, the response to adrenergic agonists varies among tissues; for example, glycogenolysis in the liver or muscle (predominantly a $\beta$ effect), contraction (an $\alpha_{1}$ effect) or relaxation (a $\beta_{2}$ effect) in vascular smooth muscle, or a change in the inotropic or chronotropic state of the heart (a $\beta_{1}$ effect).

Dopamine also can interact with several GPCRs. The D1 receptor is coupled to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ and the D2 receptor is linked to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$.

## STEROID AND THYROID HORMONES

## Cholesterol is the precursor for the steroid hormones: cortisol, aldosterone, estradiol, progesterone, and testosterone

Members of the family of hormones called steroids share a common biochemical parentage: all are synthesized from cholesterol. Only two tissues in the body possess the enzymatic apparatus to convert cholesterol to active hormones. The adrenal cortex makes cortisol (the main glucocorticoid hormone), aldosterone (the principal mineralocorticoid in humans), and androgens. The gonads make either estrogen and progesterone (ovary) or testosterone (testis). In each case, production of steroid hormones is regulated by trophic hormones released from the pituitary.

For aldosterone, the renin-angiotensin system also plays an important regulatory role.

The pathways involved in steroid synthesis are summarized in Figure 47-6. Cells that produce steroid hormones can use, as a starting material for hormone synthesis, the cholesterol that is circulating in the blood in association with low-density lipoprotein (LDL; see p. 968). Alternatively, these cells can synthesize cholesterol de novo from acetate (see Fig. 46-16). In humans, LDL cholesterol appears to furnish $\sim 80 \%$ of the cholesterol used for steroid synthesis (see Fig. 47-6). An LDL particle contains both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters, in addition to phospholipids and protein. The cell takes up this LDL particle via the LDL receptor and receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42) into clathrin-coated vesicles. Lysosomal hydrolases then act on the cholesteryl esters to release free cholesterol. The cholesterol nucleus, whether taken up or synthesized de novo, subsequently undergoes a series of reactions that culminate in the formation of pregnenolone, the common precursor of all steroid hormones. Via divergent pathways, pregnenolone is then further metabolized to the major steroid hormones: the mineralocorticoid aldosterone (see Fig. 50-2), the glucocorticoid cortisol (see Fig. 50-2), the androgen testosterone (see Fig. 54-6), and the estrogen estradiol (see Fig. 55-8).

Unlike the peptide and amine hormones considered above, steroid hormones are not stored in secretory vesicles before their secretion (Table 47-4). For these hormones, synthesis and secretion are very closely linked temporally. Steroid-secreting cells are capable of increasing the secretion of steroid hormones many-fold within several hours. The lack of a preformed storage pool of steroid hormones does not appear to limit the effectiveness of these cells as an endocrine regulatory system. Furthermore, steroid hormones, unlike peptide and amine hormones, mediate nearly all their actions on target tissues by regulating gene transcription. As a result, the response of target tissues to steroids typically occurs over hours to days.

Like cholesterol itself, steroid hormones are poorly soluble in water. On their release into the circulation, some steroid

Figure 47-6 Uptake of cholesterol and synthesis of steroid hormones from cholesterol. The cholesterol needed as the starting material in the synthesis of steroid hormones comes from two sources. Approximately $80 \%$ is taken up as LDL particles via receptor-mediated endocytosis. The cell synthesizes the remaining cholesterol de novo from acetyl coenzyme A (Acetyl CoA). Apo B-100, apolipoprotein B-100; VLDL, very-lowdensity lipoprotein.

hormones associate with specific binding proteins (e.g., cortisol-binding globulin) that transport the steroid hormones through the circulatory system to their target tissues. The presence of these binding proteins, whose concentration in the circulation can change in response to a variety of physiological conditions, can complicate efforts to measure the amount of active steroid hormone in the circulation.

## Steroid hormones bind to intracellular receptors that regulate gene transcription

Steroid hormones appear to enter their target cell by simple diffusion across the plasma membrane (Fig. 47-7). Once within the cell, steroid hormones are bound with high
affinity ( $K_{\mathrm{D}}$ in the range of 1 nM ) to receptor proteins located in the cytosol or the nucleus. As detailed in Chapter 4, binding of steroid hormone to its receptor results in a change in the receptor conformation so that the "active" receptorhormone complex now binds with high affinity to specific DNA sequences called hormone response elements (see p. 90) or steroid response elements (SREs), also called sterol regulatory elements. These sequences are within the $5^{\prime}$ region of target genes whose transcription is regulated by the specific steroid hormone-receptor complex. Termination of gene regulation by the steroid hormone-receptor complex is not as well understood as initiation of the signal. The receptor protein may be modified in a manner that permits dissociation of the hormone and DNA. The receptor itself could then be recycled and the steroid molecule metabolized or otherwise cleared from the cell.

Steroid receptors are monomeric phosphoproteins with a molecular weight that is between 80 and 100 kDa . A remarkable similarity is seen among receptors for the glucocorticoids, sex steroids, retinoic acid, the steroid-like vitamin 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, and thyroid hormone. The genes encoding the receptors for these diverse hormones are considered part of a gene superfamily (see pp. 71-72). Each of these receptors has a similar modular construction with six domains (A through F). The homology among receptors is especially striking for the C domain, particularly the C 1 subdomain, which is the part of the receptor molecule that is responsible for binding to DNA (see Fig. 3-14).

Steroid hormone receptors dimerize on binding to their target sites on DNA. Dimerization appears essential for the regulation of gene transcription. Within the C1 DNAbinding domain of the steroid receptor monomer are two

![bo096000512f](bo096000512f.jpg)

zinc fingers that are involved in binding of the receptor to DNA (see p. 82). Even receptors with very different biological actions have a striking sequence similarity in this domain of the receptor. Because the specificity with which genes are regulated by a specific steroid receptor arises from the specificity of the DNA-binding domain, mutations in this region can greatly alter hormone function. For example, substitution of two amino acids in the glucocorticoid receptor causes the mutated glucocorticoid receptor to bind to DNA to which the estrogen receptor normally binds. In such a system, a glucocorticoid could have an estrogen-like effect.

The activated steroid receptor, binding as a dimer to SREs in the $5^{\prime}$ region of a gene, regulates the rate of transcription of that gene. Each response element is identifiable as a consensus sequence of nucleotides, or a region of regulatory DNA in which the nucleotide sequences are preserved through different cell types. The effect of gene regulation by activated steroid receptors binding to an SRE is dramatically illustrated by the chick ovalbumin gene. Chicks that are not exposed to estrogen have approximately four copies of the ovalbumin mRNA per cell in the oviduct. A 7-day course of estrogen treatment increases the number of copies of message 10,000-fold! This increase in message is principally the result of an increased rate of gene transcription. However, steroid hormones can also stabilize specific mRNA molecules and increase their half-life. (○) N47-2

The $5^{\prime}$ flanking region of the gene typically has one or more SREs upstream of the TATA box, a nucleotide sequence rich in adenine and thymine that is located near the starting point for transcription (see p. 78). The activated steroid hormone receptors recognize these SREs from their specific consensus sequences. For example, one particular consensus sequence designates a site as a glucocorticoid response element if the SRE is in a cell with a glucocorticoid receptor. This same consensus sequence in a cell of the endometrium would be recognized by the activated progesterone receptor or, in the renal distal tubule, by the activated mineralocorticoid receptor. The specificity of the response thus depends on the cell's expression of particular steroid receptors, not simply the consensus sequence. For example, the renal distal tubule cell expresses relatively more mineralocorticoid
receptors than it does progesterone receptors when compared with the endometrium. As a result, changes in plasma aldosterone regulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the kidney with greater sensitivity than does circulating progesterone. However, very high levels of progesterone can, like aldosterone, promote salt reabsorption.

From the foregoing it should be apparent that the specificity of response of a tissue to steroid hormones depends on the abundance of specific steroid receptors expressed within a cell. Because all somatic cells have the full complement of DNA with genes possessing SREs, whether a cell responds to circulating estrogen (e.g., breast), androgen (e.g., prostate), or mineralocorticoid (e.g., renal collecting duct) depends on the receptors present in the cell. This specificity raises the obvious, but as yet unanswered, question of what regulates the expression of specific steroid receptors by specific tissues.

Within a given tissue, several factors control the concentration of steroid hormone receptors. In the cytosol of all steroid-responsive tissues, steroid receptor levels usually drop dramatically immediately after exposure of the tissue to the agonist hormone. This decrease in receptor level is the result of net movement of the agonist-receptor complex to the nucleus. Eventually, the cytosolic receptors are repopulated. Depending on the tissue, this repopulation may involve new synthesis of steroid hormone receptors or simply recycling of receptors from the nucleus after dissociation of the agonist from the receptor. In addition, some steroids reduce the synthesis of their own receptor in target tissues. For example, progesterone reduces the synthesis of progesterone receptor by the uterus, thus leading to an overall net reduction or downregulation of progesterone receptor concentration in a target tissue. An interesting observation in this regard is that the genes for steroid receptor proteins do not appear to have SREs in their $5^{\prime}$ flanking region. Thus, this regulation of receptor number probably involves trans-acting transcriptional factors other than the steroid hormones themselves.

Other factors that affect the concentration of steroid receptors in target tissues include the state of differentiation of the tissue, the presence of other hormones that affect

# BOX 47-3 Quantitation of Steroid Receptors in Patients with Cancer 

The affinity of steroid molecules for their receptors can be studied in vitro in a manner analogous to that described for the radioimmunoassay of peptide hormones (see Fig. 47-1). In a typical immunoassay, an antibody with high affinity for a hormone or other compound binds to a radioactively labeled hormone or other molecule. A sample containing an unknown amount of the compound to be measured is added to the antibody-labeled hormone mixture and displaces the radioisotope from the antibody in proportion to the concentration of the unknown. The amount of unknown can be quantitated by comparison to the displacing activity of known standards.

For quantitating steroid receptors, cell extracts containing an unknown amount of steroid receptors are incubated with increasing concentrations of labeled steroid hormone. At each concentration, hormone that is bound by the receptor is separated from that remaining free in the extract. The result is a saturation curve (Fig. 47-8A), provided the tissue extract has a finite number of specific hormone receptors. This saturation curve can often be linearized by a simple arithmetic manipulation called a Scatchard plot (see Fig. 47-8B). This analysis allows quantitation of the affinity of the receptor for the hormone and provides an estimate of the number of receptors (actually, the concentration of receptors) for that particular hormone.

The technique of quantitating receptor number has found an important application in determining the number of estrogen and
progesterone receptors present in breast cancer cells. The number of estrogen and progesterone receptors per milligram of breast cancer tissue (obtained by biopsy of the breast or involved lymph node) is quantitated with radiolabeled estrogen (or progesterone). For postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer (i.e., a tumor with a high level of estrogen receptors), treatment with an antiestrogen (e.g., tamoxifen) is effective therapy. For premenopausal women, an antiestrogen may be used as well, or the ovaries can be removed surgically. The woman might be given an aromatase inhibitor that blocks estradiol synthesis or a long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, which paradoxically blocks both LH and FSH production by the anterior pituitary and thereby reduces estradiol production and accomplishes a medical oophorectomy. The continuous (as opposed to the normally pulsatile) administration of GnRH downregulates GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary (see Box 55-2).

These therapies are not effective in patients with cancers that do not express significant numbers of estrogen receptors. The presence of abundant estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast tumors correlates with a more favorable prognosis, possibly because of the relatively advanced state of differentiation of the tumor, as well as the tumor's responsiveness to manipulation by estrogen or progesterone therapy.
steroid receptor synthesis, and whether the steroid hormone has previously stimulated the tissue. For example, estrogen receptor concentrations are low in an unstimulated uterus but rise dramatically in an estrogen-primed uterus (receptor upregulation). Regulation of steroid receptor number is clearly one factor that alters overall tissue sensitivity to these hormones (Box 47-3).

## Thyroid hormones bind to intracellular receptors that regulate metabolic rate

In many respects, the thyroid gland and thyroid hormone are unique among the classic endocrine axes. In Chapter 49, we will see that this uniqueness begins with the structure of the thyroid gland, which is composed of follicles. Each

follicle is an epithelial monolayer encircling a protein-rich fluid. The principal protein component of the follicular fluid is an extremely large protein, thyroglobulin. Neither of the two thyroid hormones- $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ nor $\mathrm{T}_{3}$-is free in the follicular fluid. Rather, these hormones are formed by the iodination of tyrosine residues within the primary structure of the thyroglobulin molecule.
$\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ remain part of the thyroglobulin molecule in the follicle lumen until thyroid secretion is stimulated. The entire thyroglobulin molecule then undergoes endocytosis by the follicular cell and is degraded within the lysosomes of these cells. Finally, the follicular cell releases the free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ into the circulation. Once secreted, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is tightly bound to one of several binding proteins. It is carried to its sites of action, which include nearly all the cells in the body. In the process of this transport, the liver and other tissues take up some of the $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and partially deiodinate it to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$; this $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ can then re-enter the circulation.

Both $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ enter target cells and bind to cytosolic and nuclear receptors. These receptors are similar to those for steroid hormones (see pp. 71-72). $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ has higher affinity than $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ for the thyroid hormone receptor. Even though it accounts for only $\sim 5 \%$ of the circulating thyroid hormone, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is probably the main effector of thyroid hormone signaling. The activated thyroid hormone receptor binds to thyroid hormone response elements in the $5^{\prime}$ region of responsive genes and regulates the transcription of multiple target genes.

Thyroid hormone receptors are present in many tissues, including the heart, vascular smooth muscle, skeletal muscle, liver, kidney, skin, and CNS. A major role for thyroid hormone is overall regulation of metabolic rate. Because $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ affects multiple tissues, individuals affected by disorders
involving oversecretion or undersecretion of thyroid hormone manifest a host of varied symptoms that reflect the involvement of multiple organ systems.

## Steroid and thyroid hormones can also have nongenomic actions

A central dogma has been that all the diverse actions of steroid and thyroid hormones are due to genomic regulation. However, the very rapid onset of some effects (occurring within 2 to 15 minutes) appear incompatible with a mechanism requiring new protein synthesis. Such accumulating evidence suggests that steroid and thyroid hormones can bind to receptors that modulate the activity of cytosolic proteins and thereby regulate their activity or behavior via a nongenomic action. An example is the binding of extracellular estrogen or aldosterone to the GPCR called GPR30, also known as the G-protein estrogen receptor (GPER). Receptor occupancy rapidly activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$ and then adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53), thereby raising [cAMP], and stimulating PKA (see p. 57). In addition, GPR30 indirectly activates the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a receptor tyrosine kinase (see pp. 68-70), and some of its downstream effectors, such as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; see pp. 69-70) and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs; see pp. 68-69). Besides estrogen and aldosterone, other ligands of nuclear receptors have nongenomic actions: thyroid hormones, testosterone, and glucocorticoids.

# ENDOCRINE REGULATION OF GROWTH AND BODY MASS 

Eugene J. Barrett

Growth from the fertilized ovum to the adult is an exceedingly complex process involving both hyperplasia (an increase in the number of cells) and hypertrophy (an increase in the size of cells) as well as turnover of the cellular elements of body tissues. The timing and capacity for cell division vary among tissues. In the human central nervous system (CNS), neuronal division is essentially complete by 1 year of age, whereas bone, muscle, and fat cells continue to divide until later in childhood. Other tissues-such as skin, blood, and liver-retain the capacity for hyperplasia throughout life.

In humans, the genetic contribution to growth is evident from the observation that midparental height (i.e., the average of paternal and maternal heights) is one of the better predictors of a child's ultimate stature. For domestic animals, breeding based on desired growth characteristics has been a mainstay of animal husbandry for millennia. For humans, in whom such planned breeding does not occur, body-height differences among different populations suggest a genetic contribution. Even more striking are some of the differences seen with specific genetic mutations that affect skeletal growth (e.g., achondroplasia). The basis of these population height differences, and those related to genetic syndromes, is beyond the scope of this chapter. Rather we will focus on nutritional and hormonal processes in which physiological regulation appears to play an important role across individuals. The impact of environmental and nutritional factors, such as emotional or nutritional deprivation, on growth is most profound when it occurs during periods of tissue hyperplasia, most critically during the first 2 years of life.

In this chapter, the first two subchapters deal with factors that affect linear growth, whereas the third deals with factors that regulate body mass. This division is somewhat artificial because changes in linear growth and body mass often occur simultaneously. The control of linear growth in humans depends on multiple hormones, including growth hormone $(\mathrm{GH})$, insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (IGF-1 and IGF-2), insulin, thyroid hormones, glucocorticoids, androgens, and estrogens. Among these, GH and IGF-1 have been implicated as the major determinants of growth in normal postuterine life. However, deficiencies (or excesses) of each of the other hormones can seriously affect the normal growth of the musculoskeletal system as well as the growth and maturation of other tissues. The control of body mass depends on many newly discovered humoral factors made in adipose
tissue, intestine, hypothalamus, and other tissues that regulate appetite and energy expenditure.

## GROWTH HORMONE

## GH, secreted by somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary, is the principal endocrine regulator of growth

Individuals with excessive GH secretion during childhood develop gigantism, and those with a deficiency of GH develop pituitary dwarfism. It is thus quite clear that GH profoundly affects somatic size. Dramatic examples of the somatotrophic action of GH can be found in the descriptions of General Tom Thumb (5) N48-1 and the Alton giant. GH deficiency resulted in Tom Thumb's achieving an adult height of $\sim 1.0 \mathrm{~m}$. In contrast, the Alton giant had a GH-secreting pituitary tumor present from early childhood and reached an adult height of $>2.7 \mathrm{~m}$. It is important that, in both cases, the abnormality of GH secretion was present from early life. Children with GH deficiency are of normal size at birth and only subsequently fall behind their peers in stature.

A deficiency of GH beginning in adult life does not result in any major clinical illness. However, it is now appreciated that replacement of GH (clinically available as a recombinant protein) in adults with GH deficiency leads to increased lean body mass, decreased body fat, and perhaps an increased sense of vigor or well-being. An excess of GH after puberty results in the clinical syndrome of acromegaly (from the Greek akron [top] + megas [large]). This condition is characterized by the growth of bone and many other somatic tissues, including skin, muscle, heart, liver, and the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The lengthening of long bones is not part of the syndrome because the epiphyseal growth plates close at the end of puberty. Thus, acromegaly causes a progressive thickening of bones and soft tissues of the head, hands, feet, and other parts of the body. If untreated, these somatic changes cause significant morbidity and shorten life as a result of joint deformity, hypertension, pulmonary insufficiency, and heart failure.

GH is made by somatotrophs throughout the anterior pituitary (see pp. 978-979). Like other peptide hormones, GH is synthesized as a larger "prehormone" (Fig. 48-1). During processing through the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi system, several small peptides are removed. GH exists in at least three molecular forms. The predominant form is

Charles S. Stratton (1838-1883), whose stage name was General Tom Thumb, was a famous performer in the P.T. Barnum circus. Stratton's maternal and paternal grandmothers were twin sisters of short stature. At birth, Stratton was somewhat larger than average ( 4.3 kg , or 9 pounds, 8 ounces) and he continued to grow normally until about 6 months of age, when he was 64 cm ( 25 inches) tall and weighed 6.8 kg ( 15 pounds). After that, he virtually ceased to grow for several years, although he was otherwise completely normal. He had siblings of normal size.

At the age of 9, Stratton began to grow very slowly, reaching the height of 74 cm ( 2 feet, 5 inches) at age 13 and 82.6 cm ( 2 feet, 8.5 inches) at age 18. At age 25, Stratton married Mercy Lavinia Bumpus (stage name, Lavinia Warren), who was also a short person. They had no children, and the cause of Stratton's short stature is not known.

The American circus impresario P.T. Barnum heard of Stratton and recruited him for his circus when Stratton was age 5. Barnum coached Stratton, who became a song-and-dance man and comedian. Tours of both the United States and Europe were great successes, and Stratton became an international celebrity and, under the guidance of Barnum, a wealthy man.

Figure 48-1 Synthesis of GH. Somatotrophic cells in the anterior pituitary are responsible for the synthesis of GH. The cell transcribes five exons to form GH mRNA for either the 22-kDa protein (191 amino acids) or the 20-kDa protein (176 amino acids). Alternative splicing in the third exon, which removes the RNA-encoding amino acids 32 to 46 , is responsible for the two isoforms found in the pituitary. Both mRNAs have a signal sequence that causes them to be translated in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and enter the secretory pathway. Subsequent processing converts the two pre-pro-GHs first to the pro-GHs and then to the mature GHs. The cleavage of the pro sequence and disulfide-bond formation occur during transit through the Golgi bodies. The somatotroph stores mature GH in granules until GHRH stimulates the somatotroph to secrete the hormones. The 22-kDa version is the dominant form of GH.
a 22-kDa polypeptide with two intramolecular sulfhydryl bonds. Alternative splicing generates a $20-\mathrm{kDa}$ form of GH. Other GH forms include a $45-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein, which is a dimer of the $22-\mathrm{kDa}$ form, as well as larger forms that are multimers of monomeric GH. There is little information to suggest that the different principal forms of GH (i.e., the 20 - and $22-\mathrm{kDa}$ versions) vary in their activity, but the $20-\mathrm{kDa}$ form
may exert fewer of the acute metabolic actions of GH. Once synthesized, GH is stored in secretory granules in the cytosol of the somatotrophs until secreted.

## GH is in a family of hormones with overlapping activity

GH appears to be a single-copy gene, but four other hormones have significant homology to GH. Most striking are three hormones made by the placenta: placental-variant GH (pvGH) and human chorionic somatomammotropins 1 and 2 (hCS1 and hCS2; Table 48-1). Human genes for these hormones are located in the GH gene cluster on the long arm of chromosome 17. The multiple genes in this cluster have an identical intron structure and encode proteins of similar size with substantial amino-acid sequence homology.
pvGH is a 191 -amino-acid peptide that is $93 \%$ identical to the $22-\mathrm{kDa}$ form of GH. With virtually the same affinity as GH for the hepatic GH receptor, pvGH mimics some of the biological actions of GH and may be an important modulator of systemic IGF-1 production during pregnancy. (As discussed below, a major action of GH is to stimulate secretion of IGF-1.)

The hCSs are also called human placental lactogens (hPLs). The affinity of the two forms of hCS for the GH receptor is 100 - to 1000 -fold less than that of either GH or pvGH. As a result, the hCSs are less effective in promoting production of IGF-1 or IGF-2. The somatomammotropins are primarily lactogenic, priming the breast for lactation after birth (see Table 56-6).

The pituitary hormone prolactin (PRL; see Table 48-1) is the fourth hormone with homology to GH. The principal physiological role of PRL involves promotion of milk production in lactating women (see pp. 1148-1150). PRL is made by lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Its homology to GH suggests that the two hormones, despite their divergent actions, arose from some common precursor by a geneduplication event. The sequence homology between these proteins is underscored by the observation that GH and PRL have similar affinities for the PRL receptor. The converse is not true-that is, PRL has no significant affinity for the GH receptor and thus has no growth-promoting activity. As discussed below, the PRL and GH receptors are coupled to an intracellular signaling system that involves stimulation of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases (see p. 70) as an early postreceptor event.

Men, like women, make PRL throughout their lives. However, no physiological role for PRL in males has been defined. Both men and women with disorders involving hypersecretion of GH or PRL can develop galactorrhea (breast milk secretion). Although GH and PRL are normally secreted by distinct cell populations in the anterior pituitary, some benign GH-producing pituitary adenomas (i.e., tumors) secrete PRL along with GH.

## Somatotrophs secrete GH in pulses

Whereas growth occurs slowly over months and years, the secretion of GH is highly episodic, varying on a minute-tominute basis. Most physiologically normal children experience episodes or bursts of GH secretion throughout the day, most prominently within the first several hours of sleep.

Figure 48-2 Bursts in plasma levels of GH, sampled in the blood plasma of a 23-year-old woman every 5 minutes over a 24 -hour period. Each peak in the plasma GH concentration reflects bursts of hundreds of GH -secretory pulses by the somatotrophs of the anterior pituitary. These bursts are most common during the first few hours of sleep. The integrated amount of GH secreted each day is higher during pubertal growth than in younger children or in adults. (Data from Hartman ML, Veldhuis JD, Vance ML, et al: Somatotropin pulse frequency and basal concentrations are increased in acromegaly and are reduced by successful therapy. J Clin Endocrinol Metab 70:1375, 1990.)

Underlying each peak in plasma levels of GH, illustrated for an adult in Figure 48-2, are bursts of many hundreds of pulses of GH secretion by the somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary. With the induction of slow-wave sleep, several volleys of GH pulses may occur; it is estimated that $>70 \%$ of total daily GH secretion occurs during these periods. This pulsatile secretion underlines the prominent role of the CNS in the regulation of GH secretion and growth. The circulating GH concentrations may be up to 100 -fold higher during the bursts of GH secretion (i.e., the peaks in Fig. 48-2) than during intervening periods. The pattern of bursts depends on sleep-wake patterns, not on light-dark patterns. Exercise, stress, high-protein meals, and fasting also cause a rise in the mean GH level in humans. In circumstances in which GH secretion is stimulated (e.g., fasting or consumption of a high-protein diet), the increased GH output results from an increase in the frequency-rather than the amplitude-of pulses of GH secretion by the somatotrophs.

## GH secretion is under hierarchical control by GH-releasing hormone and somatostatin

The coordination of GH secretion by the somatotrophs during a secretory pulse presumably occurs in response to both positive and negative hypothalamic control signals.

GH-Releasing Hormone Small-diameter neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus secrete growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH), a 43-amino-acid peptide that reaches the somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary via the hypophyseal portal blood (Fig. 48-3). As the name implies, this neuropeptide promotes GH secretion by the somatotrophs. GHRH is made principally in the hypothalamus, but it can also be found in neuroectodermal tissue outside the CNS; it was first isolated and purified from a pancreatic islet cell tumor of a patient with acromegaly.

GHRH Receptor GHRH binds to a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on the somatotrophs and activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$, which in turn stimulates adenylyl cyclase (see pp. 56-57). The subsequent rise in [cAMP], causes increased gene transcription and synthesis of GH. In addition, the rise in [cAMP], opens $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane and causes $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to rise. This increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ stimulates the release of preformed GH.

Ghrelin A relatively newly discovered hormone, ghrelin consists of 28 amino acids. One of the serine residues is linked to an octanol group, and only this acylated form of the peptide is biologically active. (5) N48-2 Distinct endocrine cells within the mucosal layer of the stomach release

Circulating forms of ghrelin include both the acyl and deacylated species, and this has complicated efforts to define the physiological responses of ghrelin to dietary manipulation as well as the responses to exogenously administered hormone. Ghrelin has 28 amino acids and is also known as ghrelin-28. The sequence of human ghrelin (amino acids 24 to 51 of the full, immature peptide), using the single-letter code, is as follows: GSSFLSP EHQRVQQRKE SKKPPAKLQPR. Ghrelin-27 has only 27 amino acids, lacking the C-terminal arginine of ghrelin-28.

Figure 48-3 Synthesis and release of GHRH and SS, and the control of GH release. GHRH raises [cAMP], and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in the somatotrophs and thereby stimulates release of GH stored in secretory granules. SS inhibits adenylyl cyclase (AC), lowers $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thereby inhibits release of GH. PKA, protein kinase A.
ghrelin in response to fasting. Endocrine cells throughout the GI tract also make ghrelin, although the highest ghrelin concentrations are in the fundus of the stomach. The arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus also makes small amounts of ghrelin. Infusion of ghrelin either into the bloodstream or into the cerebral ventricles markedly increases growth hormone secretion. Indeed, ghrelin appears to be involved in the postmeal stimulation of growth hormone secretion. It has been more difficult to define the extent to which ghrelin-versus GHRH and somatostatin (SS)—contributes to the changes in normal growth hormone secretion in response to fasting, amino-acid feeding, and carbohydrate feeding. Ghrelin also is orexigenic (i.e., it stimulates appetite; see p. 1003), thereby contributing to body mass regulation as well as linear growth.

Ghrelin Receptor The hormone ghrelin binds to a GPCR designated GH secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR1a). This receptor was first identified because it binds synthetic peptide ligands that stimulate GH secretion. In this regard, GHSR1a is like the GHRH receptor (GHRHR); however, GHSR1a does not bind GHRH.

Somatostatin The hypothalamus also synthesizes SS, a 14-amino-acid neuropeptide. SS is made in the periventricular region of the hypothalamus and is secreted into the hypophyseal portal blood supply. It is a potent inhibitor of GH secretion. SS is also made elsewhere in the brain and in selected tissues outside the CNS, such as the pancreatic islet $\delta$ cells (see p. 1053) and D cells in the GI tract (see pp. 868870 and Table 41-1). Within the CNS, the 14-amino-acid

form of SS (SS-14) dominates. The GI tract predominantly expresses a 28 -amino-acid splice variant; the C-terminal 14 amino acids of SS-28 are identical to those of SS-14.

It appears that the primary regulation of GH secretion is stimulatory, because sectioning the pituitary stalk, and thereby interrupting the portal blood flow from the hypothalamus to the pituitary, leads to a decline in GH secretion. Conversely, sectioning of the stalk leads to a rise in PRL levels, presumably because dopamine made in the hypothalamus normally inhibits PRL secretion in the anterior pituitary (see pp. 1149-1150). It also appears that the pulses of GH secretion are entrained by the pulsatile secretion of GHRH (as opposed to the periodic loss of SS inhibition).

SS Receptor SS binds to a GPCR called SSTR found on somatotrophs and activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$, which inhibits adenylyl cyclase. As a result, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ decreases, which diminishes the responsiveness of the somatotroph to GHRH. When somatotrophs are exposed to both GHRH and SS, the inhibitory action of SS prevails.

## Both GH and IGF-1 negatively feed back on GH secretion by somatotrophs

In addition to being controlled by GHRH, ghrelin, and SS, somatotroph secretion of GH is under negative-feedback control via IGF-1. As discussed below, GH triggers the secretion of IGF-1 from GH target tissues throughout the body (Fig. 48-4, No. 1). Indeed, IGF-1 mediates many of the growth-promoting actions of GH. IGF-1 synthesized in tissues such as muscle, cartilage, and bone may act in a paracrine or autocrine fashion to promote local tissue growth. In contrast, circulating IGF-1, largely derived from hepatic secretion, exerts endocrine effects. Circulating IGF-1 suppresses GH secretion through both direct and indirect mechanisms.

First, circulating IGF-1 exerts a direct action on the pituitary to suppress GH secretion by the somatotrophs (see Fig. 48-4, No. 2), probably inhibiting GH secretion by a mechanism different from that of SS. In its peripheral target cells, IGF-1 acts through a receptor tyrosine kinase (see pp. 68-70) and not by either the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ or cAMP messenger systems. IGF-1 presumably acts by this same mechanism to inhibit GH secretion in somatotrophs.

Second, circulating IGF-1 inhibits GH secretion via two indirect feedback pathways, both targeting the hypothalamus. IGF-1 suppresses GHRH release (see Fig. 48-4, No. 3) and also increases SS secretion (see Fig. 48-4, No. 4).

Yet another feedback system, independent of IGF-1, reduces GH secretion. Namely, GH itself appears to inhibit GH secretion in a short-loop feedback system (see Fig. 48-4, No. 5).

## GH has short-term anti-insulin metabolic effects as well as long-term growth-promoting effects mediated by IGF-1

Once secreted, most GH circulates free in the plasma. However, a significant fraction ( $\sim 40 \%$ for the $22-\mathrm{kDa} \mathrm{GH}$ ) is complexed to a GH-binding protein formed by proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain of GH receptors in

GH target tissues. This protein fragment binds to GH with high affinity, thereby increasing the half-life of GH and competing with GH target tissues for GH. In the circulation, GH has a half-life of $\sim 25$ minutes.

GH Receptor GH binds to a receptor (GHR) on the surface of multiple target tissues. The monomeric GHR is a 620-amino-acid protein with a single membrane-spanning segment. The molecular weight of GHR ( $\sim 130 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) greatly exceeds that predicted from its amino-acid composition $(\sim 70 \mathrm{kDa})$ as a result of extensive glycosylation. Like other members of the type I cytokine receptor family, GHR is a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor (see pp. 70-71). When one GH molecule simultaneously binds to sites on two GHR monomers and acts as a bridge, the monomers dimerize (see Fig. 3-12D). Receptor occupancy increases the activity of a tyrosine kinase (JAK2 family) that is associated with, but is not an integral part of, the GH receptor. This tyrosine kinase triggers a series of protein phosphorylations that modulate target cell activity.

Short-Term Effects of GH GH has certain short-term (minutes to hours) actions on muscle, adipose tissue, and liver that may not necessarily be related to the more longterm growth-promoting actions of GH. These acute metabolic effects (Table 48-2) include stimulation of lipolysis in adipose tissue, inhibition of glucose uptake by muscle, and stimulation of gluconeogenesis by hepatocytes. These actions oppose the normal effects of insulin (see pp. 1035-1050) on these same tissues and have been termed the anti-insulin or diabetogenic actions of GH. Chronic oversecretion of GH, such as occurs in patients with GH-producing tumors in acromegaly, is accompanied by insulin resistance and often by glucose intolerance or frank diabetes.

Long-Term Effects of GH via IGF-1 Distinct from these acute actions of GH is its action to promote tissue growth by stimulating target tissues to produce IGFs. In 1957, Salmon and Daughaday reported that GH itself does not have growth-promoting action on epiphyseal cartilage (the site where longitudinal bone growth occurs). In those experiments, the addition of serum from normal animals, but not from hypophysectomized (GH-deficient) animals, stimulated cartilage growth in vitro (assayed as incorporation of radiolabeled sulfate into cartilage). The addition of GH to GH-deficient serum did not restore the growth-promoting activity seen with normal serum. However, when the GHdeficient animals were treated in vivo with GH, their plasma promoted cartilage growth in vitro. This finding led to the hypothesis that, in animals, GH provokes the secretion of another circulating factor that mediates the action of GH.

| Fat | $\uparrow$ Lipolysis |

Figure 48-4 GH and IGF-1 (also called somatomedin C) negative-feedback loops. Both GH and IGF-1 feed back-either directly or indirectly-on the somatotrophs in the anterior pituitary to decrease GH secretion. GH itself inhibits GH secretion ("short loop"). IGF-1, whose release is stimulated by GH, inhibits GH release by three routes, one of which is direct and two of which are indirect. The direct action is for IGF-1 to inhibit the somatotroph. The first indirect pathway is for IGF-1 to suppress GHRH release in the hypothalamus. The second is for IGF-1 to increase secretion of SS, which in turn inhibits the somatotroph.

Initially called sulfation factor because of how it was assayed, this intermediate was subsequently termed somatomedin because it mediates the somatic effects of GH. We now know that somatomedin is in fact two peptides resembling proinsulin and thus termed insulin-like growth factors 1 and 2 (Fig. 48-5). Indeed, the IGFs exert insulin-like actions
in isolated adipocytes and can produce hypoglycemia in animals and humans. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are made in various tissues, including the liver, kidney, muscle, cartilage, and bone. As noted above, the liver produces most of the circulating IGF-1, which more closely relates to GH secretion than does IGF-2.

![bo166000512f](bo166000512f.jpg)

Figure 48-5 Structure of the IGFs. Insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 share three domains (A, B, and C), which have a high degree of amino-acid (AA) sequence homology. The C region is cleaved from insulin (as the C peptide) during processing, but is not cleaved from either IGF-1 or IGF-2. In addition, IGF-1 and IGF-2 also have a short D domain.

## GROWTH-PROMOTING HORMONES

## IGF-1 is the principal mediator of the growth-promoting action of GH

The synthesis of IGF-1 and, to a lesser extent, IGF-2 depends on circulating GH. As described above, the periodic nature of GH secretion results in a wide range of plasma GH concentrations. In contrast, plasma [IGF-1] does not vary by more than $\sim 2$-fold over a 24 -hour period. The plasma [IGF-1] in effect integrates the pulsatile, highly fluctuating GH concentration. The reason for the relatively steady plasma levels of IGF-1 is that like GH—but unlike most peptide hormones-IGF-1 circulates bound to several IGF-1-binding proteins. These binding proteins are made principally in the liver, but they are also manufactured by other tissues. More than $90 \%$ of IGF-1 measured in the serum is bound to these proteins. At least six distinct IGF-binding proteins have been identified. In addition to providing a buffer pool in plasma of bound IGF, these proteins may aid the transfer of IGF to the tissue receptors, thereby facilitating the action of these hormones. The local free fraction of IGF-1 is probably the more biologically active component that binds to the receptor and stimulates tissue growth.

Like other peptide hormones, IGF-1 and IGF-2 are synthesized via the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35) and are secreted into the extracellular space, where they may act locally in a paracrine fashion. In the extracellular space, the IGFs encounter binding proteins that may promote local retention of the secreted hormone by increasing the overall molecular size of the complex. This action inhibits the entry of the IGFs into the vascular system. Thus, local concentrations of the IGFs are likely to be much higher than plasma concentrations.

Whether made locally or reaching tissues through the circulation, IGF-1 acts via a specific receptor tyrosine kinase (see pp. 68-70), a heterotetramer that is structurally related to the insulin receptor (Fig. 48-6). Like the insulin receptor (see pp. 1041-1042), the IGF-1 receptor (IGF1R) has two completely extracellular $\alpha$ chains and two transmembrane $\beta$ chains. Also like in the insulin receptor, the $\beta$ chains have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Binding of IGF-1 to its receptor enhances receptor autophosphorylation as well as
phosphorylation of downstream effectors. The structural homology between the insulin and IGF-1 receptors is sufficiently high that insulin can bind to the IGF-1 receptor, although with an affinity that is about two orders of magnitude less than that for IGF-1. The same is true for the binding of IGF-1 to insulin receptors. In fact, the homology between the insulin and IGF-1 receptors is so strong that hybrid receptors containing one $\alpha-\beta$ chain of the insulin receptor and one $\alpha-\beta$ chain of the IGF-1 receptor are present in many tissues. These hybrid receptors bind both insulin and IGF-1, but their affinity for IGF-1 is greater.

Given the structural similarity between insulin and IGFs and between the insulin receptor and the IGF-1 receptor, it is not surprising that IGFs can exert insulin-like actions in vivo. This effect has been particularly well studied for IGF-1, which, like insulin, induces hypoglycemia when injected into animals. This action is largely the result of increased uptake of glucose into muscle tissue. IGF-1 is less effective in mimicking insulin's action on adipose and liver tissue; in humans, these tissues have few IGF-1 receptors. In muscle, IGF-1 promotes the uptake of radiolabeled amino acids and stimulates protein synthesis at concentrations that do not stimulate glucose uptake. Thus, IGF-1 promotes growth at lower circulating concentrations than those required to produce hypoglycemia (Box 48-1).

## IGF-2 acts similarly to IGF-1 but is less dependent on GH

The physiology of IGF-2 differs from that of IGF-1 both in terms of control of secretion and receptor biology. Regarding control of secretion, IGF-2 levels depend less on circulating GH than do IGF-1 levels. In GH deficiency-as seen in pituitary dwarfism-circulating levels of IGF-1, but not IGF-2, are decreased. In states of excessive GH secretion, plasma IGF-1 level is reliably elevated, whereas plasma IGF-2 level is not.

Regarding receptor biology, although IGF-2 binds to the IGF-1 receptor, it preferentially binds to the so-called IGF-2 receptor (IGF2R). This IGF-2 receptor is a single-chain polypeptide that is structurally very distinct from the IGF-1 receptor and is not a receptor tyrosine kinase (see Fig. 48-6). After IGF2R binds IGF-2, the internalization of the complex

Figure 48-6 Comparison of insulin, IGF-1, and IGF-2 receptors. Both the insulin and IGF-1 receptors are heterotetramers joined by disulfide bonds. For both, the cytoplasmic portions of the $\beta$ subunits have tyrosine kinase domains as well as autophosphorylation sites. The IGF-2 receptor (also called the mannose-6-phosphate [MBP] receptor) is a single polypeptide chain with no kinase domain.

# BOX 48-1 Plasma Level of IGF-1 as a Measure of GH Secretion 

The plasma concentration of IGF-1 is a valuable measure of GH secretion. The wide swings in plasma [GH] that result from the pulsatile secretion of this hormone have confounded efforts to use GH measurements to diagnose disorders of GH deficiency or excess. However, an increased circulating concentration of IGF-1 is one of the most useful clinical measures of the excess GH secretion that occurs in acromegaly (i.e., GH excess in adults) and gigantism (i.e., GH excess in children). Measurement of plasma [IGF-1] has also helped to explain the genesis of a particular type of dwarfism known as Laron dwarfism. These patients were initially identified as persons with growth failure mimicking that of typical pituitary dwarfism; however, plasma [GH] is normal or elevated, and treatment
with GH is ineffective in reversing the growth failure. It was subsequently demonstrated that these individuals have mutations of their GH receptors that make the receptors nonfunctional. Thus, the mutant GH receptors cannot trigger the production of IGFs. With the availability of recombinant IGF-1, effective treatment of these children may be possible with restoration of growth.

Despite the structural similarity of their receptors, IGF-1 and insulin exert different actions on tissues. IGF-1 has a more marked effect on growth, and insulin has a more significant effect on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the differences in the postreceptor signaling pathways triggered by the two hormones have not been fully defined.
clears IGF-2 from the blood plasma. In an unrelated function, IGF2R in the trans Golgi binds-at a site different from that for IGF-2 binding-newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases tagged with mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) for trafficking to the lysosomes.

Despite these differences, IGF-2 does share with IGF-1 (and also with insulin) the ability to promote tissue growth and to cause acute hypoglycemia. These properties appear to result from IGF-2's structural similarity to proinsulin and its ability to bind to the IGF-1 receptor.

Figure 48-7 Serum IGF-1 levels and height velocity as a function of age. The red curve shows the mean plasma concentrations of IGF-1 as a function of age in human females. The curve for males is similar, but the peak is shifted to an older age by 3 to 4 years. The brown curve indicates for females the mean height velocity-the rate at which height increases ( $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{yr}$ ). The pubertal peak rate of growth corresponds to the peak serum concentrations of IGF-1. (Data from Reiter EO, Rosenfeld RG: Normal and aberrant growth. In Wilson JD, Foster DW, Kronenberg HM, Larsen PR [eds]: Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, 9th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1998, pp 1427-1507.)

## Growth rate parallels plasma levels of IGF-1 except early and late in life

Illustrated in Figure 48-7 is the mean concentration of total IGF-1 (both free and bound) found in human serum as a function of age. Also shown is the normal rate of height increase ( $\mathrm{cm} / \mathrm{yr}$ ). During puberty, the greatest growth rates are observed at times when plasma [IGF-1] is highest. A similar comparison can be made using GH, provided care is taken to obtain multiple measurements at each age and thereby account for the pulsatile secretion and marked diurnal changes that occur in plasma [GH].

Whereas, during puberty, growth rate parallels plasma [IGF-1], the two diverge at both younger and older ages. A first period of life for this divergence is very early childhood (see Fig. 48-7), which is characterized by a very rapid longitudinal growth rate, but quite low IGF-1 levels. If this time frame is extended back to intrauterine life, then the discordance is even greater. Indeed, children with complete GH deficiency have very low plasma [IGF-1] levels but are of normal length and weight at birth. This observation suggests that during intrauterine life, factors other than GH and IGF-1 are important regulators of growth. One of these additional factors may be insulin, as discussed below. Another explanation for the divergence between growth rate and IGF-1 levels may be that IGF-2 is an important mediator of intrauterine growth. Plasma [IGF-2] is greater during fetal life than later and peaks just before birth. Plasma [IGF-2] plummets soon after birth, but then it gradually doubles between birth and age 1 year, and remains at this level until at least the age of 80 years. Thus, IGF-2 levels are at adult levels during the first several years of life, when IGF-1 levels are low but growth is rapid. However, several other
hormones may also contribute to somatic growth during the first several years of life.

By age 3 or 4 years, GH and IGF-1 begin to play major roles in the regulation of growth. The concentrations of these hormones rise throughout childhood and peak during the time of the pubertal growth spurt. The rate of long-bone growth in the pubertal growth spurt is exceeded only during intrauterine life and early childhood. The frequency of pituitary GH secretory pulses increases markedly at puberty. The factors responsible for this acceleration are not clear. However, the accompanying sexual maturation likely plays some role, because both estradiol and testosterone appear to promote GH secretion.

During adulthood, longitudinal growth essentially ceases, yet secretion of GH and of IGF-1 continues to be highly regulated, although the circulating concentrations of both hormones decline during aging. For many years, the continued secretion of these hormones in adults was considered to be largely vestigial. This belief was reinforced by the observation that cessation of GH secretion and the consequent decline of IGF-1 after trauma, a pituitary tumor, or surgical removal of the pituitary did not result in any clear clinical syndrome. However, in GH-deficient adults replacement with recombinant human GH leads to remarkable increases in body muscle mass, decreases in fat mass, and improved nitrogen balance (a measure of protein nutrition). These findings support the conclusion that-even after linear growth ceases after puberty-GH and IGF-1 remain important regulators of body composition and appear to promote anabolic actions in muscle. Indeed, some investigators have suggested that supplementing physiologically normal adults with GH or IGF-1 may reverse some of the effects of aging,

including loss of muscle mass, negative nitrogen balance, and osteoporosis.

Nutritional factors also modulate both GH secretion and IGF-1 production. In both children and adults, GH secretion is triggered by high dietary protein intake. Teleologically, this is intriguing in that it may provide linkage between the availability of amino acids to serve as substrates for body protein synthesis (growth) and the endocrine stimulus of cells to grow. This relationship is not simple, however, because the rise in GH levels in the setting of protein intake is not sufficient to stimulate IGF-1 production fully. This principle is well illustrated by fasting, which is associated with a decline in IGF-1 even with increased GH. During fasting, insulin levels are low. Thus, increased insulin appears to be required, at least in some tissues, for GH to stimulate IGF-1 effectively.

## Thyroid hormones, steroids, and insulin also promote growth

Although the discussion to this point emphasizes the action of GH and the GH-induced growth factors as modulators of somatic growth, we could regard them as necessary but not sufficient agents for normal growth. Certain other hormones, as well as receptive growth-responsive cartilage, are required. Because growth is a difficult phenomenon to study, especially in humans (few scientists want to follow an experiment over 10 to 20 years), much of our understanding of endocrine regulation of normal growth derives from observations of abnormal growth as it occurs in clinical syndromes of endocrine excess or deficiency. Several of the more important of these endocrine influences are illustrated here. The exact mechanism by which growth is regulated by these agents is not always well understood.

Thyroid Hormones Next to GH, perhaps the most prominent among the growth-promoting hormones are the thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine, which we discuss in Chapter 49. In many nonhuman species, thyroid hormone plays a major role in tissue growth and remodeling. For example, resorption of the tadpole tail during morphogenesis requires thyroid hormone. In humans, severe deficiency of thyroid hormones early in life causes dwarfism and mental retardation (cretinism; see pp. 1013-1014). In children with normal thyroid function at birth, development of hypothyroidism at any time before epiphyseal fusion leads to growth retardation or arrest. Much of the loss in height that occurs can be recovered through thyroid hormone treatment, a phenomenon called catch-up growth. However, because the diagnosis of hypothyroidism may elude detection for many months or years, delays in initiating treatment can lead to some loss of potential growth. A child's growth curve can provide a particularly sensitive early indicator of hypothyroidism.

Sex Steroids As with thyroid hormones, the importance of sex steroids for growth is most readily understood by considering the effects of deficiency or excess of these hormones. Androgen or estrogen excess occurring before the pubertal growth spurt accelerates bone growth. However, the sex steroids also accelerate the rate at which the skeleton
matures and thus shorten the time available for growth before epiphyseal closure occurs. Most of the time, the dominant effect of sex steroids is to narrow the growth window, thereby diminishing ultimate longitudinal bone growth. This effect is well illustrated in settings in which children are exposed to excessive sex steroid at an early age. The sex steroids can come from endogenous sources (e.g., early maturation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis that produces premature puberty, or tumors that secrete estrogen or androgen) or from exogenous sources (e.g., children who take sex steroids prescribed for others). Again, the growth curve is useful in that it typically shows an increase in growth rate, followed by an early leveling off of growth associated with the development of secondary sexual characteristics.

Glucocorticoids An excess of adrenal glucocorticoids inhibits growth. Growth ceases in children who produce too much cortisol, as a result of either adrenal or pituitary tumors (which secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] and cause secondary increases in plasma cortisol levels). The use of synthetic glucocorticoids in treating various serious illnesses (e.g., asthma, organ transplantation, various chronic autoimmune processes) also can arrest growth. Restoration of normal growth does not occur until the glucocorticoid levels return toward normal. Neither GH nor IGF-1 concentrations drop significantly during glucocorticoid treatment. The failure of GH administration to correct the growth retardation that occurs in glucocorticoid-treated children further confirms that GH deficiency cannot account for the growth failure associated with glucocorticoid excess. Because linear growth is related to cartilage and bone synthesis at the growth plates, glucocorticoids presumably are acting at least in part at these sites to impair growth. However, the specific biochemical locus at which glucocorticoids act remains unclear. In adults, as in children, glucocorticoid excess impairs tissue anabolism and thus may manifest as wasting in some tissues (e.g., bone, muscle, subcutaneous connective tissue), rather than growth failure. This tissue wasting results in some of the major clinical morbidity associated with glucocorticoid excess (i.e., osteoporosis, muscle weakness, and bruising).

In glucocorticoid deficiency, growth is not substantially affected. However, other deleterious effects of cortisol deficiency (e.g., hypoglycemia, hypotension, weakness; see p. 1019) dominate.

Insulin Insulin is also an important growth factor, particularly in utero. For example, women with diabetes frequently have high blood levels of glucose during pregnancy and deliver babies of high birth weight (fetal macrosomia). The developing fetus exposed to glucose concentrations that are higher than normal secretes additional insulin. Hyperinsulinemia results in increased fetal growth. Fetal macrosomia can create significant obstetric difficulties at the time of delivery.

Conversely, infants born with pancreatic agenesis or with one of several forms of severe insulin resistance are very small at birth. One form of this condition, leprechaunism, is the result of a defect in the insulin receptor (see Box 51-4). Thus, it appears that insulin, acting through its own receptor, is an intrauterine growth factor.

## BOX 48-2 Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids

We are all unfortunately familiar with the potential for abuse of anabolic-androgenic steroids by bodybuilders and competitive athletes. Illicit use of these agents appears to be widespread in sports, where strength is closely linked to overall performance. Not only naturally occurring androgens (e.g., testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone), but also many synthetic androgenic steroids-as well as GH—serve as performance enhancers. In addition to the sought-after "beneficial" effects of increasing muscle mass and strength, each of these agents carries with it a plethora of adverse side effects. Some-such as oily skin, acne, and hair growth—are principally cosmetic. Others-including liver function abnormalities, mood changes with aggressive behavior, and hepatocellular carcinoma-are much more serious. Illicit use of these agents by younger athletes, especially teenagers, is also problematic with regard to alterations in growth and sexual maturation.

Severe insulin deficiency produces a marked catabolic effect associated with wasting of lean body mass in both children and adults. The acute adverse effects of such deficiency (dehydration and acidosis) dominate the clinical picture. Mild insulin deficiency, as seen in patients with chronically undertreated diabetes, diminishes growth in affected children. Improved diabetes management may allow restoration of normal growth rates and possibly even some transient accelerated or catch-up growth. Thus, with good care, children with diabetes can expect to achieve normal adult height (Box 48-2).

## The musculoskeletal system responds to growth stimuli of the GHRH-GH-IGF-1 axis

Longitudinal growth involves lengthening of the somatic tissues (including bone, muscle, tendons, and skin) through a combination of tissue hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Each of these tissues remodels its structure throughout life. For bone, longitudinal growth occurs by the hyperplasia of chondrocytes at the growth plates of the long bones, followed by endochondral ossification. The calcified cartilage is remodeled as it moves toward the metaphyses of the bone, where it is eventually replaced by cortical bone (see pp. 1056-1057) and trabecular bone (see p. 1057). This process continues until epiphyseal closure occurs toward the completion of puberty.

The process of cartilage formation and longitudinal bone growth begins as the cellular elements capable of forming cartilage divide along the growth plate and then migrate toward the more mature bone. These cells synthesize the extracellular matrix of cartilage, which includes type II collagen, hyaluronic acid, and mucopolysaccharides. These cells appear to respond directly to GH by proliferating and increasing production of the extracellular matrix. This response involves local generation of IGF-1 within the cartilage as an early event in the growth process. As the cells more closely approach the already formed cortical and trabecular bone, ossification of the extracellular matrix begins, and eventually the cellular elements become isolated by the

calcifying cartilage. However, this calcified cartilage is not structurally the same as normal bone, and soon after formation it begins to be remodeled by an ingrowth of cellular elements (osteoclasts and osteoblasts) from adjacent bone. Eventually, it is replaced by normal bone, and becomes part of the metaphysis of the long bone.

In most children, growth ceases within several years after completion of puberty, when the chondrocytes at the growth plates of the long bones cease dividing and calcify the previously cartilaginous surrounding matrix. After puberty, radial growth occurs as bones increase their diameter through a process of endosteal bone resorption and periosteal bone deposition. This process is not strictly compartmentalized; that is, resorption and deposition of bone occur at both the periosteal and endosteal surfaces. However, during periods of growth, the rate of periosteal deposition exceeds the rate of endosteal resorption, and the bone shafts grow in width and thickness.

As may be expected, numerous disorders disrupt the complex process of endochondral bone growth on a genetic or congenital basis (e.g., defects in collagen or mucopolysaccharide synthesis) and lead to genetic forms of dwarfism. In these settings, the GHRH-GH-IGF-1 axis is entirely intact and appears to regulate normally. No apparent compensation occurs for the short stature by increased GH secretion, a finding suggesting that the axis is not sensitive to the growth process per se, but simply to the intermediate chemical mediator IGF-1.

GH and IGF-1 clearly play important roles in mediating longitudinal bone growth and also modulate growth of other tissues. Thus, proportional growth of muscle occurs as bones elongate, and the visceral organs enlarge as the torso increases in size. The mechanisms by which GH and IGF-1 coordinate this process and the way in which other hormones or growth factors may be involved continue to be investigated. It is clear that, whereas GH and, more recently, IGF-1 have been considered the major hormones responsible for somatic growth, other tissue growth factors play an important, albeit incompletely defined, role. Table 48-3 lists some of these growth factors. In general, the tissue growth factors have more tissue-specific actions on organogenesis and their growth-promoting activity than the IGFs, and they appear to act largely in a paracrine or autocrine fashion.

## REGULATION OF BODY MASS

The multiple hormonal factors that influence longitudinal growth-discussed in the previous two subchapters-are themselves responsive to the nutritional intake of a growing

individual. For example, amino acids and carbohydrates promote insulin secretion, and amino acids stimulate GH secretion (see pp. 992-994). In addition, the availability of an adequate balanced nutrient supply likely exerts both direct and indirect influences to promote tissue growth. Independent of any hormonal factors, glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids can each influence the transcription of specific genes. Similarly, amino acids can directly activate the signaling pathways involved in regulating messenger RNA (mRNA) translation.

Beyond the effects of macronutrients, the effects of micronutrients can be similarly important in regulating cell growth and, by extension, growth of the organism. An example is iodine, a deficiency of which can produce dwarfism (see p. 1009). In a more global fashion, the effect of nutrient limitation on height can be appreciated by considering the differences in mean height between men in North Korea ( 165 cm ) and South Korea ( 171 cm ). As mentioned on page 990, nutritional deprivation early in life can markedly limit longitudinal growth. Perhaps equally fascinating, and only recently appreciated, is that nutritional deprivation early in life also appears to predispose affected individuals to obesity when they reach middle age. This phenomenon was first noted in epidemiological studies in several European countries that revealed a positive correlation between middleaged obesity and being born during periods of deprivation during and immediately following the Second World War. Such findings suggest that some level of genetic programming occurs early in life that both diminishes longitudinal growth and predisposes persons to body mass accretion.

## The balance between energy intake and expenditure determines body mass

At any age or stage of life the factors that govern body mass accretion relate specifically to the energy balance between intake and expenditure. If energy intake exceeds expenditure over time-positive energy balance (see p. 1173)—body mass will increase, assuming the diet is not deficient in essential macronutrients or micronutrients. Small positive deviations from a perfect energy balance, over time, contribute to the major increase in body weight-the "obesity epi-demic"-that affects many middle-aged adults, and increasingly adolescents, in developed societies. For example, if energy intake in the form of feeding exceeds energy expenditure by only 20 kcal ( 1 tsp of sugar) daily, over 1 year a person would gain $\sim 1 \mathrm{~kg}$ of fat, and over 2 decades, $\sim 20 \mathrm{~kg}$.

Indeed, it is remarkable that many adults maintain a consistent body weight for decades essentially in the absence of conscious effort. Thus, a finely tuned regulatory system must in some manner "monitor" one or more aspects of body mass, direct the complex process of feeding (appetite and satiety) to replete perceived deficiencies, and yet avoid excesses.

## Energy expenditure comprises resting metabolic rate, activity-related energy expenditure, and diet-induced thermogenesis

We can group energy expenditure into three components:

1. Resting metabolic rate (RMR). The metabolism of an individual who is doing essentially nothing (e.g.,
sleeping) is known as the RMR (see p. 1170), which amounts to $\sim 2100 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day for a young $70-\mathrm{kg}$ adult. The RMR supports maintenance of body temperature, the basal functioning of multiple body systems (e.g., heartbeat, GI motility, ventilation), and basic cellular processes (e.g., synthesizing and degrading proteins, maintaining ion gradients, metabolizing nutrients).
2. Activity-related energy expenditure. As we wake up in the morning and begin to move about, we expend more energy than resting metabolism. Exercise or physical work can have a major impact on total daily energy expenditure and varies widely across individuals, and within an individual on a day-to-day basis. We also expend energy in activities not classically regarded as exercise or heavy work, such as tapping the foot while sitting in a chair, looking about the room during a physiology lecture, typing at a keyboard-activities dubbed non-exercise-associated thermogenesis or NEAT. Such energy expenditures can vary 3- to 10 -fold across individuals and can account for 500 kcal or more of daily energy expenditure. NEAT differences, over time, could contribute considerably to differences in weight gain by individuals with identical caloric intake.
3. Diet-induced thermogenesis. Eating requires an additional component of energy expenditure for digesting, absorbing, and storing food. Typically, diet-induced thermogenesis accounts for $10 \%$ of daily energy expenditure. Proteins have a higher thermic effect than either carbohydrates or fats (i.e., the metabolism and storage of proteins requires more energy).

Each of these three components of energy expenditure can vary considerably from day to day and is subject to regulation. For example, thyroid hormone is a major regulator of thermogenesis (see p. 1013). Overproduction of thyroid hormone increases both RMR and NEAT, whereas thyroid hormone deficiency has the opposite effect. (5) N48-3

## Hypothalamic centers control the sensations of satiety and hunger

Classic studies in which investigators made lesions in, or electrically stimulated, specific brain regions identified two areas in the hypothalamus that are important for controlling eating. A satiety center is located in the ventromedial nucleus (VMN; see Fig. 47-3). Electrical stimulation of the satiety center elicits sensations of satiety, even when an animal is in the presence of food. Conversely, a lesion of the satiety center causes continuous food intake (hyperphagia) even in the absence of need. A hunger (or feeding) center is located in the lateral hypothalamic area (see Fig. 47-3). Electrical stimulation of this center elicits a voracious appetite, even after an animal has ingested adequate amounts of food. A lesion of the hunger center causes complete and lasting cessation of food intake (aphagia).

## Leptin tells the brain how much fat is stored

Only in the last 2 decades have we begun to understand regulatory mechanisms that maintain body mass, an advance made possible by the study of mouse models of obesity. One

# N48-3 Effect of Hyperthyroidism on Basal Metabolic Rate 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

One of the earliest tests for hyperthyroidism was to measure basal metabolic rate (BMR), as discussed in the text on page 1170. This method is not used today because BMR can be affected by other factors (e.g., body size, fever, catecholamines, fasting), so changes cannot be related specifically to the thyroid. In addition, it is cumbersome to measure BMR accurately compared with obtaining serum estimates of thyroid hormone concentrations or activity.

Nevertheless, all things being equal, thyroid hormone increases the BMR. The difference between BMR and RMR is discussed on page 1170.

Figure 48-8 Parabiosis experiments. In parabiotically coupled mice, $\sim 1 \%$ of the cardiac output of one mouse goes to the other, and vice versa, so that the animals exchange blood-borne factors. Wt, wild type.
monogenic model is the $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ strain of hyperphagic mice that develop morbid obesity; affected mice typically weigh $>100 \%$ more than unaffected animals of the same strain. In parabiosis experiments in which an $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mouse was surgically connected to a wild-type mouse (Fig. 48-8A), the $\mathrm{Ob} /$ Ob mouse lost weight, which suggests that such mice lack a blood-borne factor. Another model of monogenic obesity is the ( $\mathrm{Db} / \mathrm{Db}$ ) mouse, named Db because it secondarily develops type 2 diabetes (see Box 51-5). Like $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mice, $\mathrm{Db} /$ Db mice are hyperphagic, with adult body weights $\sim 100 \%$ greater than those of lean littermates. However, in parabiosis experiments connecting a $\mathrm{Db} / \mathrm{Db}$ and a wild-type mouse (see Fig. 48-8B), the wild-type mouse starved. Finally, in parabiosis experiment connecting an $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ to a $\mathrm{Db} / \mathrm{Db}$ mouse (see Fig. 48-8C), the Ob mouse lost weight but the Db mouse remained obese. These results indicate the following:

1. The Db mouse makes an excess of the blood-borne factor that cures the Ob mouse.
2. The Db mouse lacks the receptor for this factor.
3. Absence of the receptor in the Db mouse removes the negative feedback, which leads to high levels of the bloodborne factor.

In 1994, Jeffrey Friedman and his colleagues used positional cloning to identify leptin (from the Greek leptos [thin]), the blood-borne factor lacked by Ob mice. Leptin is a $17-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein made almost exclusively in adipocytes. The replacement of leptin in $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mice leads to rapid weight loss. In 1995, Tepper and collaborators cloned the leptin receptor (LEP-R). The deficiency of this receptor in Db mice makes them leptin resistant. LEP-R is a tyrosine kinaseassociated receptor (see Fig. 3-12D) that signals through JAK2 and STAT (see Fig. 4-14). Among the several splice variants of LEP-R, the "long-form" is richly expressed in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and several other CNS sites.

Although leptin acts on numerous tissues, it somehow crosses the blood-brain barrier (see pp. 284-287) and modulates neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that
secrete pro-opiomelanocortin (see Fig. 50-4) and influence feeding behavior. These same neurons also have insulin receptors. Plasma leptin levels in humans appear to rise in proportion to the mass of adipose tissue (Box 48-3). Conversely, the absence of leptin produces extreme hyperphagia, as in $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mice. Plasma leptin has a half-time of $\sim 75$ minutes, and acute changes in food intake or fasting do not appreciably affect leptin levels. In contrast, insulin concentrations change dramatically throughout the day in response to dietary intake. Thus, it appears that leptin in some fashion acts as an intermediate- to long-term regulator of CNS feeding behavior, whereas insulin (in addition to intestinal hormones like glucagon-like peptide 1 [GLP-1] and cholecystokinin [CCK]) is a short-term regulator of the activity of hypothalamic feeding centers.

In addition to acting to control appetite, leptin promotes fuel utilization. Indeed, leptin-deficient humans paradoxically exhibit some characteristics of starvation (e.g., fuel conservation via decreased thermogenesis and basal metabolic rate).

## Leptin and insulin are anorexigenic (i.e., satiety) signals for the hypothalamus

At least two classes of neurons within the arcuate nucleus contain receptors for leptin and insulin. These neurons, in turn, express neuropeptides. One class of neurons produces pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC), whereas the other produces neuropeptide Y (NPY) and agouti-related protein (AgRP).

POMC Neurons Insulin and leptin each stimulate largely distinct subgroups of POMC-secreting neurons (Fig. 48-9), which produce POMC. At their synapses, POMC neurons release a POMC cleavage product, the melanocortin $\alpha$ melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$; see Fig. 50-4), which in turn binds to MC3R and MC4R melanocortin receptors on second-order neurons. Stimulation of these receptors not only promotes satiety and decreases food intake-that is, $\alpha$-MSH is anorexigenic (from the Greek $a$ [no] + orexis [appetite])—but also increases energy expenditure via activation of descending sympathetic pathways. An indication of the importance of this pathway is that $\sim 4 \%$ of individuals with severe, early-onset obesity have mutations in MC3R or MC4R. POMC neurons also synthesize another protein-cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART)—which, like $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$, is anorexigenic.

NPY/AgRP Neurons In addition to stimulating POMC neurons, both insulin and leptin can also suppress neurons in the arcuate nucleus that release NPY and AgRP at their synapses (see Fig. 48-9). NPY activates NPY receptors (which are GPCRs)-predominantly Y1R and Y5R-on secondary neurons, thereby stimulating eating behavior. AgRP binds to and inhibits MC4R melanocortin receptors on the secondary neurons in the POMC pathway, thereby inhibiting the anorexigenic effect of $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$. Thus, both NPY and AgRP are orexigenic. The yellow obese or agouti mouse overexpresses the agouti protein, which inhibits melanocortin receptors. Overinhibition of MC1R on melanocytes inhibits the dispersion of pigment granules (leading to yellow rather than dark fur). Overinhibition of MC3R and MC4R on

# BOX 48-3 Human Obesity 

0ne approach for gauging the extent to which human body mass is appropriate for body height is to compute the body mass index (BMI):

$$
\mathrm{BMI}=\frac{\text { Weight in kg }}{\text { (Height in } \mathrm{m})^{\mathbf{2}}}
$$

BMIs fall into four major categories: (1) N48-4

1. Underweight: $<18.5$
2. Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9
3. Overweight: 25 to 29.9
4. Obesity: $\geq 30$

A caution in using BMI is that it takes no account of an excess or deficiency in body water content, and thus its use is inappropriate in edematous states like cirrhosis or heart failure. Although a BMI of $\geq 30$ is an indication of obesity, BMI is not a direct measure of adipose-tissue fat mass (see p. 1243). Obesity is an area of intense investigation driven in part by the obesity epidemic that is adversely affecting the health of a large fraction of the human population.

The demonstration that replacement of leptin in $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mice led to rapid weight loss raised considerable enthusiasm for the potential of leptin as a pharmacological agent in the treatment of human obesity. Indeed, extremely rare individuals have been identified with autosomal recessive monogenic obesity secondary to leptin deficiency, like the $\mathrm{Ob} / \mathrm{Ob}$ mouse. As expected, these individuals respond to exogenous leptin administration with a marked reduction in body weight. However, investigators soon appreciated that the vast majority of obese humans are not leptin deficient. Quite the contrary, plasma leptin concentrations increase proportionately to BMI, which is a rough estimate of adipose-tissue fat mass.

Although obese people generally are not leptin deficient, approximately one third of the obese lose weight in response to exogenous leptin. These individuals are leptin resistant, but they eventually respond to sufficiently high levels of the hormone. In the other two thirds of obese people, the leptin resistance is so severe that they fail to respond to the exogenous hormone. Lean people lose weight in response to leptin. Persons with congenital lipodystrophy lack adipocytes and thus are leptin deficient. Affected individuals are lean but have excess triacylglycerols in muscle and liver, are very insulin resistant, and develop diabetes. Treatment with leptin corrects this metabolic disorder.

Other mutations besides those of the leptin gene cause monogenic human obesity. Extremely rare are mutations of the leptin receptor gene (analogous to the defect in the Db mouse) and mutations of the POMC gene (leading to loss of the anorexigenic $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$ ). A more common cause of monogenic human obesity is a mutation in the melanocortin receptor MC4R, the target of $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}$.

Currently no satisfactory pharmacological approaches are available to treat obesity. Given the prevalence of obesity and the likelihood that any pharmacological intervention would need to be long-term, antiobesity drugs are of significant interest within the pharmaceutical industry. Among the agents in late stages of clinical testing, none directly targets the hypothalamic pathways described here. However, because feeding is such a complex behavior-being influenced by hunger, reward and pleasure centers in the CNS, as well as peripheral signals (e.g., gastric distention)—agents may be effective even if they only secondarily affect the hypothalamic control system.
anorexigenic neurons blocks the action of $\alpha$-MSH (leading to obesity).

Secondary Neurons The POMC/CART and NPY/AgRP neurons project to secondary neurons in five major locations (see Fig. 48-9; see also Fig. 47-3):

1. Lateral hypothalamic area (LHA). In this hunger center (see p. 1001), NPY/AgRP neurons stimulatebut POMC neurons inhibit-secondary neurons. These project throughout the brain and release the orexigenic peptides melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH) or orexins A and B.
2. Ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (VMN). This nucleus is a satiety center (see p. 1001).
3. Dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus (DMN).
4. Paraventricular nucleus (PVN). This nucleus contains neurons that in turn project to both cerebral cortex and areas of the brainstem (see Fig. 47-3).
5. Nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). This nucleus (see p. 348) integrates sensory information from the viscera and also receives input from paraventricular neurons.

## Ghrelin is an orexigenic signal for the hypothalamus

Signals originating from the periphery can be not only anorexigenic (i.e., promoting satiety) - as in the case of leptin (from adipose tissue) and insulin (from the pancreas)-but
also orexigenic (i.e., promoting appetite). One of these is ghrelin (see pp. 992-993), made in response to fasting by specialized endocrine cells in the gastric mucosa. Indeed, systemically administered ghrelin acutely increases food intake when it is given at physiological doses in both animals and humans. Circulating ghrelin concentrations, however, appear to be lower in obese than in lean humans, which suggests that ghrelin does not drive the increased caloric intake in the obese. However, gastric bypass procedures in morbidly obese patients cause a dramatic decline in ghrelin levels, along with a decline in body weight and food consumption.

As discussed previously, ghrelin binds to GHSR1a (see p. 993), which is present in neurons of the arcuate nucleus as well as vagal afferents. Some hypothalamic neurons themselves contain ghrelin, and injection of ghrelin into the cerebral ventricles stimulates feeding. It is not clear to what extent circulating ghrelin promotes appetite via vagal afferents versus hypothalamic receptors. As noted above, ghrelin also promotes the secretion of GH and thus appears to have a role in both longitudinal growth and body mass accretion.

## Plasma nutrient levels and enteric hormones are short-term factors that regulate feeding

Investigators have proposed various theories to explain the short-term regulation of food intake, including models

To see how to compute BMI, visit http://nhlbi/support.com/ bmi/. However, the simplistic formula for computing BMI can be misleading in some cases. For example, in the cachexia of cancer, the patient loses not only adipose tissue, but also fat-free mass. Thus, the fall in the BMI is greater than the fall in adipose mass. On the other hand, the accumulation of extracellular fluid in a patient with ascites (see Box 24-2) or interstitial edema (see Box 20-1) does not reflect an increase in adipose tissue. Thus, the rise in BMI can be greater than any rise in the mass of adipose tissue.

focusing on the regulation of levels of blood glucose (glucostatic), amino acids (aminostatic) or lipids (lipostatic). For example, hypoglycemia produces hunger and also increases the firing rate of glucose-sensitive neurons in the hunger center in the LHA, but decreases the firing rate of glucosesensitive neurons in the satiety center in the VMN. Hypoglycemia also activates orexin-containing neurons in the LHA.

Feedback from the GI tract also controls the short-term desire for food (see Fig. 48-9). GI distention triggers vagal afferents that, via the NTS (see p. 348), suppress the hunger center. Peripherally administering any of several GI peptide hormones normally released in response to a meal-gastrinreleasing peptide (GRP; see p. 868), CCK (see pp. 882-883), peptide YY (PYY; see p. 892), SS (see pp. 993-994), glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053), GLP-1 (see p. 1041)-reduces meal size (i.e., these substances are anorexigenic). The most important is CCK, which is more effective when injected directly into the peritoneal cavity; this effect requires an intact vagus nerve. Therefore, CCK-like gastric distention-may act via
vagal afferents. Additionally, an oropharyngeal reflex responds to chewing and swallowing; it may meter food intake, thus inhibiting further eating after a threshold.

An important aspect of our increasing understanding of the neuroendocrine control systems that regulate appetite, satiety, and energy expenditure and thereby body mass is the further affirmation that these processes have a genetic and biochemical basis. Two other factors that influence body mass are cortical control (e.g., "willpower") and environment (e.g., the availability of high-calorie foods). Our emerging appreciation of the biological basis of obesity may allow a more scientific and clinical approach to therapeutic interventions-rather than simply blaming affected patients for their obesity.

# THE THYROID GLAND 

Eugene J. Barrett

The thyroid gland is located in the anterior neck, lying like a small bow tie across the front of the trachea. In adults, the normal thyroid weighs $\sim 20 \mathrm{~g}$. It is composed of left and right lobes and a small connecting branch, or isthmus.

The thyroid gland possesses many features unique among endocrine glands, not the least of which is that it is the only endocrine gland common to both sexes that can be easily seen and palpated in the course of a routine clinical examination. At the biochemical level, the thyroid hormones are the only ones that require an essential trace element, iodine, for the production of active hormone. Another unusual feature of thyroid hormone physiology is that the hormone is stored in an extracellular site within a highly proteinaceous material called thyroid colloid. The major protein within this material is thyroglobulin, which contains-as part of its primary structure-the thyroid hormones tetraiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or thyroxine) and triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$. Thyroglobulin, the sequestered prohormone, is entirely surrounded by thyroid follicular cells, which are responsible for the synthesis of thyroid hormones (Fig. 49-1).

The physiological actions of thyroid hormones also display several unique aspects. Although derived from a large protein (i.e., thyroglobulin), $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are not peptides. Unlike peptide hormones or hormones derived from single amino acids (e.g., catecholamines), no cell membrane receptors exist for $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Instead, like the steroid hormones, thyroid hormones act principally by binding to nuclear receptors (see pp. 71-72) and regulate the transcription of cell proteins. $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ act on multiple tissues and are essential for normal development, growth, and metabolism.

The $\mathbf{C}$ cells (parafollicular cells) of the thyroid, which are not part of the follicular unit, synthesize another hormone, calcitonin (see Fig. 49-1). Calcitonin may play a role in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate homeostasis, and we discuss its physiology on pages 1067-1068.

## SYNTHESIS OF THYROID HORMONES

## $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, made by iodination of tyrosine residues on thyroglobulin, are stored as part of thyroglobulin molecules in thyroid follicles

The structures of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, the two active thyroid hormones, are shown in Figure 49-2. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is far more active than $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. Also shown is reverse $\mathrm{T}_{3}\left(\mathbf{r T}_{3}\right)$, which has no known biological activity. It has two iodines on its outer benzyl ring, rather
than two on its inner ring, as is the case for $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. All three compounds derive from the ether linkage of a tyrosine molecule to the benzyl group of a second tyrosine molecule; one or two iodine atoms are attached to each benzyl group. The bottom panel of Figure 49-2 shows $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ as part of the thyroglobulin molecule.

The synthesis of thyroid hormones begins with the trapping of iodine by the thyroid gland. Iodine is essential for the formation of thyroid hormones. It exists in nature as a trace element in soil and is incorporated into many foods. The iodide anion ( $\mathrm{I}^{-}$) is rapidly absorbed by the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and is actively taken up via a specialized Na/I cotransporter or symporter (NIS or SLC5A5; see p. 122), located at the basolateral membrane (i.e., facing the blood) of the thyroid follicular cell (Fig. 49-3). NIS is a $65-\mathrm{kDa}$ integral membrane protein that is believed to have 13 membrane-spanning segments. NIS moves two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and one $\mathrm{I}^{-}$into the follicular cell against the $\mathrm{I}^{-}$electrochemical gradient, fueled by the energy of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient (see pp. 120-123). Several other anions (e.g., perchlorate, pertechnetate, and thiocyanate) can compete with $\mathrm{I}^{-}$for uptake by the thyroid. Iodide leaves the follicular cell and enters the lumen of the follicle across the apical membrane. The Cl-I exchanger pendrin (SLC26A4; see p. 125) (T) N49-1 is present on the apical membrane, where it contributes to $\mathrm{I}^{-}$secretion. Mutations in this protein can lead to a congenital syndrome typically characterized by a large thyroid gland (goiter) and hearing loss. The thyroid enlarges because of deficient $\mathrm{I}^{-}$delivery to the follicular colloid, just as it would with an $\mathrm{I}^{-}$-deficient diet (Box 49-1).

In parallel with the secretion of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$into the follicle lumen, the follicular cell secretes thyroglobulin (Tg) into the lumen; Tg contains the tyrosyl groups to which the $\mathrm{I}^{-}$will ultimately attach. The Tg molecule is a glycoprotein synthesized within the follicular cell and exported to the follicular lumen via the secretory pathway (see p. 28). Tg is a very large protein ( $>600 \mathrm{kDa}$ ), and it accounts for approximately half of the protein content of the thyroid gland. It has relatively few tyrosyl residues ( $\sim 100$ per molecule of Tg ), and only a few of these ( $<20$ ) are subject to iodination. The secretory vesicles that contain Tg also carry the enzyme thyroid peroxidase (TPO)-an integral membrane protein, with the catalytic domain facing the vesicle lumen. As the secretory vesicles fuse with the apical membrane, the catalytic domain faces the follicular lumen and catalyzes the oxidation of $\mathrm{I}^{-}$to $\mathrm{I}^{0}$. This reaction requires $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, provided by another apical

Pendred syndrome-the combination of congenital hypothyroidism and acoustic nerve deafness-is caused by a mutation in SLC26A4, which encodes an anion exchanger called pendrin. The syndrome accounts for as much as $10 \%$ of the cases of inherited deafness and is also often associated with a goiter.

Figure 49-1 Structure of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located anterior to the cricoid cartilage in the anterior neck. The gland comprises numerous follicles, which are filled with colloid and lined by follicular cells. These follicular cells are responsible for the trapping of iodine, which they secrete along with thyroglobulin-the major protein of the thyroid colloid—into the lumen of the follicle.
membrane protein, dual-oxidase 2 (DUOX2). As the Tg is entering the lumen of the thyroid follicle by the process of exocytosis, its tyrosyl groups react with $\mathrm{I}^{0}$.

One or two oxidized iodine atoms incorporate selectively into specific tyrosyl residues of Tg . TPO in the presence of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ catalyzes the coupling of two iodinated tyrosyl residues within the Tg molecule to form a single iodothyronine as well as a remnant dehydroalanine. Both remain as part of the primary structure of the iodinated Tg until it is later degraded inside the follicular cell. This coupling of two tyrosines, catalyzed by TPO, does not occur unless they are iodinated. Because only a few tyrosyl groups become iodinated, something specific about the structure of the protein near these residues probably facilitates both iodination and conjugation. The thyroid hormones, although still part of the Tg molecule, are stored as colloid in the thyroid follicle.

## Follicular cells take up iodinated thyroglobulin, hydrolyze it, and release $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ into the blood for binding to plasma proteins

Thyroid hormones, attached to Tg in the follicular lumen (see Fig. 49-1), remain inactive until the iodinated Tg is hydrolyzed (see Fig. 49-3). Before this proteolysis can begin, the follicular cells must resorb Tg from the follicular lumen by fluid-phase endocytosis (see pp. 41-42).

However, $r T_{3}$ is essentially devoid of biological activity. As shown in the bottom panel, $T_{4}$ is part of the peptide backbone of the thyroglobulin molecule, as are $T_{3}$ and $r T_{3}$.

Figure 49-3 The follicular cell and its role in the synthesis of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. The synthesis and release of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ occurs in seven steps. Inside the follicular cell, a deiodinase converts some of the $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. TSH stimulates each of these steps except step 2. In addition, TSH exerts a growth factor or hyperplastic effect on the follicular cells. MCT8, monocarboxylate transporter 8.
toward the basolateral membrane, it fuses with lysosomes to form a lysoendosome. Inside this vesicle, lysosomal enzymes hydrolyze the Tg and form $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, as well as diiodothyronine (DIT) and monoiodothyronine (MIT). The vesicle releases both $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ near the basolateral membrane, and these substances exit the cell into the blood by an unknown mechanism. Approximately $90 \%$ of the thyroid hormone secreted by the thyroid is released as $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, and $10 \%$ is released as $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. The thyroid releases very little $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$ into the blood. As discussed in the next section, nonthyroidal tissues metabolize the $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ released by the thyroid into $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$.

Approximately three fourths of circulating $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ arises from the peripheral conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, which occurs principally in the liver and kidneys.

In the circulation, both $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are highly bound to plasma proteins. Thyroid-binding globulin (TBG), albumin, and transthyretin (TTR) account for most of this binding. The affinity of these binding proteins is sufficiently high that, for $\mathrm{T}_{4},>99.98 \%$ of the hormone circulates tightly bound to protein. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is bound only slightly less: $\sim 99.5 \%$ is protein bound. Because the free or unbound hormone in the circulation is responsible for the actions of the thyroid hormones

## BOX 49-1 lodine Deficiency

In areas where soil is relatively iodine deficient, human iodine deficiency is common. Because seawater and seafood contain large amounts of iodide, iodine deficiency is more common in inland areas, particularly in locales that rely on locally grown foods. For example, in inland areas of South America along the Andes Mountains, in central Africa, and in highland regions of Southeast Asia, iodine deficiency is common. In the early 1900s, investigators first recognized that iodide is present in high concentrations in the thyroid and that iodine deficiency promotes goiter formation. These observations led to efforts to supplement dietary iodine. lodine deficiency causes thyroid hormone deficiency. The pituitary responds to this deficit by increasing the synthesis of TSH (see p. 1014), which in turn increases the activity of the iodinetrapping mechanism in the follicular cell in an effort to overcome the deficiency. The increased TSH also exerts a trophic effect that increases the size of the thyroid gland. If this trophic effect persists for sufficient time, the result is an iodine-deficiency goiter. Goiter is the generic term for an enlarged thyroid. If this effort at compensation is not successful (i.e., if insufficient thyroid hormone levels persist), the person will develop signs and symptoms of goitrous hypothyroidism. When iodine deficiency occurs at critical developmental times in infancy, the effects on the CNS are particularly devastating and produce the syndrome known as cretinism (see p. 1013). Persons so affected have a characteristic facial appearance and body habitus, as well as severe mental retardation. Dietary supplementation of iodine in salt and bread has all but eliminated iodine deficiency in North America. In many nations, especially in mountainous and landlocked regions of developing countries, iodine deficiency remains a major cause of preventable illness.
on their target tissues, the large amount of bound hormone has considerably confounded our ability to use simple measurements of the total amount of either $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the plasma to provide a reliable index of the adequacy of thyroid hormone secretion. For example, the amount of TBG in the serum can change substantially in different physiological states. Pregnancy, oral estrogen therapy, hepatitis, and chronic heroin abuse can all elevate the amount of TBG and hence the total concentration of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Decreased levels of TBG, associated with diminished concentration of total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, can accompany steroid usage and nephrotic syndrome. However, despite the marked increases or decreases in the amounts of circulating TBG, the concentrations of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ do not change in the aforementioned cases. Box 49-2 indicates how one can calculate levels of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, knowing the concentration of TBG and the concentration of total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or total $\mathrm{T}_{3}$.

The liver makes each of the thyroid-binding proteins. TBG is a $54-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein consisting of 450 amino acids. It has the highest affinity for $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and is responsible for most of the thyroid-binding capacity in the plasma. The extensive binding of thyroid hormones to plasma proteins serves several functions. It provides a large buffer pool of thyroid hormones in the circulation, so that the active concentrations of hormone in the circulation change very little on a minute-to-minute basis. The binding to plasma proteins markedly prolongs the half-lives of both $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3} . \mathrm{T}_{4}$ has a

## BOX 49-2 Free versus Bound Thyroxine

Most of the $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the serum is bound to proteins, the most important of which is TBG. For the binding of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to TBG, the reaction is

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{T}_{4}+\mathrm{TBG} \longleftrightarrow \mathrm{~T}_{4} \mathrm{TBG} \\
\mathrm{~K}=\frac{\left\lfloor\mathrm{~T}_{4} \mathrm{TBG}\right\rfloor}{\left\lceil\mathrm{~T}_{4}\right\rceil\left\lceil\mathrm{TBG}\right\rceil}
\end{gathered}
$$

The binding constant $K$ is $-2 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M}^{-1}$ for $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. The comparable binding constant for $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is $-5 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{M}^{-1}$. Approximately one third of TBG's binding sites are occupied by $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. Therefore, we have all the information we need to compute the concentration of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ :

$$
\left\lceil\mathrm{~T}_{4}\right\rceil_{\text {PREE }}=\frac{\left\lceil\mathrm{~T}_{4} \mathrm{TBG}\right\rceil}{\mathrm{K}\left\lceil\mathrm{TBG}\right\rceil}
$$

A reasonable value for $\left\lceil\mathrm{T}_{4} \mathrm{TBG}\right\rceil$ would be 100 nM , and for [TBG], 250 nM . Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\left\lceil\mathrm{T}_{4}\right\rceil_{\text {PREE }} & =\frac{(100 \mathrm{nM})}{\left(2 \times 10^{10} \mathrm{M}^{-1}\right) \cdot(250 \mathrm{nM})} \\
& =0.20 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{M} \\
& =20 \mathrm{pM}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because the bound $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in this example is 100 nM , and the free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is only 20 pM , we can conclude that only $\sim 0.02 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in the plasma is free. Because $99.98 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in the plasma is bound, moderate fluctuations in the rate of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ release from the thyroid have only tiny effects on the level of free $\mathrm{T}_{4} . \mathrm{T}_{3}$ simplify, we have not included the minor contribution of albumin and TTR in this sample calculation.
half-life of 8 days, and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, of $\sim 24$ hours; each is longer than the half-life of steroid or peptide hormones. Finally, because much of the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the circulation is formed by the conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in extrathyroidal tissues, the presence of a large pool of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in the plasma provides a reserve of prohormone available for synthesis of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. This reserve may be of particular importance because $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is responsible for most of the biological activity of thyroid hormones.

## Peripheral tissues deiodinate $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to produce $\mathrm{T}_{3}$

The thyroid synthesizes and stores much more $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ than $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, and this is reflected in the $\sim 10: 1$ ratio of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ secreted by the thyroid. However, certain tissues in the body have the capacity to selectively deiodinate $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, thereby producing either $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{rT}_{3} . \mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$ can each be further deiodinated to various DITs and MITs (Fig. 49-4); both DITs and MITs are biologically inactive. Both iodine atoms on the inner ring, and at least one iodine atom on the outer ring, appear essential for biological activity. Similarly, the loss of the amino group renders $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ inactive. The importance of the peripheral deiodination of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ can be readily appreciated from the observation that persons whose thyroids have been removed have normal circulating concentrations of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ when they receive oral $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ supplementation.

![bo276000512f](bo276000512f.jpg)

Figure 49-4 Peripheral metabolism of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. The $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-monodeiodinases (type 1 and type 2; green arrows) remove I from the outer benzyl ring, whereas the $5 / 3$-monodeiodinase (type 3; orange arrows) removes I from the inner benzyl ring. Thus, the action of the $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-monodeiodinases on $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ yields $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, whereas the action of the $5 / 3$-monodeiodinase yields $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$. Sequential deiodination yields $\mathrm{T}_{6}$ (thyronine).

Inasmuch as $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is biologically much more active than the far more abundant $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, the regulated conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in peripheral tissues-as well the conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ to inactive metabolites-assumes considerable importance. These conversions are under the control of three deiodinases. Two deiodinases are $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-deiodinases that remove an I from the outer ring and thereby convert $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ (see Fig. 49-4). The first of these $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-deiodinases-type 1 deiodinase-is present at high concentrations in the liver, kidneys, skeletal muscle, and thyroid. It appears to be responsible for generating most of the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ that reaches the circulation. The second $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-deiodinase-type 2 deiodinase-is found predominantly in the pituitary, central nervous system (CNS), and placenta, and is involved in supplying those tissues with $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ by local generation from plasma-derived $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. As shown below, the type 2 enzyme in the pituitary is of particular importance because the $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ that is generated there is responsible for the feedback inhibition of the release of thyrotropin (or thyroid-stimulating hormone, TSH).

A third 5/3-deiodinase-type 3 deiodinase-removes an I from the inner ring, thereby converting $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to the inactive $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$. Because the $3^{\prime}$ and $5^{\prime}$ positions in $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ are equivalent stereochemically, removing either of these by type 1 or type 2 deiodinase yields $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Similarly, removal of the I from either the 3 or the 5 position of the inner ring of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ by type 3 deiodinase yields $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$. Further deiodination by any of the three enzymes ultimately yields $\mathrm{T}_{6}$ (i.e., thyronine).

The relative activity of the outer-ring deiodinases changes in response to physiological and pathological stimuli. Caloric restriction or severe stress inhibits the type 1 deiodinase; this process decreases the conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$-and thus reduces the levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. In contrast, levels of $\mathrm{rT}_{3}$ rise by default in these situations, in part because of reduced
conversion to DITs. These decreases in $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels are accompanied by a decline in metabolic rate. You may think that because plasma levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ fall, there would be a compensatory rise in TSH, the secretion of which is inhibited by $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. However, because type 2 deiodinase mediates the conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ within the pituitary and CNS, and because caloric restriction does not affect this enzyme, local $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels in the pituitary are normal. Thus, the thyrotrophs in the pituitary continue to have adequate amounts of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, and no compensatory rise in TSH occurs. Teleologically, the rationale to restrain calorie expenditure in settings of decreased caloric intake is appealing. (T) N49-2

## ACTION OF THYROID HORMONES

## Thyroid hormones act through nuclear receptors in target tissues

Thyroid hormones act on many body tissues to exert both metabolic and developmental effects. Once $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ leave the plasma, they enter the cell either by diffusing through the lipid of the cell membrane or by carrier-mediated transport (Fig. 49-5). Most, but not all, of the actions of thyroid hormones occur as thyroid hormones bind to and activate nuclear receptors (see pp. 71-72). The multitude of thyroid hormone actions is mirrored by the ubiquitous expression of thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) throughout the body's tissues. There are actually two TR genes- $\alpha$ (chromosome 17) and $\beta$ (chromosome 3)-and at least two isoforms of TR $\beta$. The expression of these receptor genes is tissue specific and varies with time of development. The liver expresses TR $\beta$, whereas TR $\alpha$ predominates in the brain. During development, the amount of $\alpha$ expressed may vary 10 -fold or

# N49-2 Effect of Calorie Restriction on Type 1 Deiodinase 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

As noted in the text, calorie restriction inhibits type 1 monodeiodinase, reducing the conversion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and thereby lowering circulating levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. This effect of caloric restriction makes sense for someone who is starving because it tends to conserve body stores of fuel. On the other hand, this effect makes it more difficult to lose weight intentionally while dieting.

Figure 49-5 Action of thyroid hormones on target cells. Free extracellular $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ enter the target cell via facilitated diffusion. Once $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is inside the cell, a cytoplasmic $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-monodeiodinase converts much of the $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, so that the cytoplasmic levels of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are about equal. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ activates thyroid hormone receptors-already bound to nuclear DNA at thyroid response elements in the promoter region of certain genes-and thereby regulates the transcription of these genes. Of the total thyroid hormone bound to receptor, $\sim 90 \%$ is $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. The receptor that binds to the DNA is preferentially a heterodimer of the thyroid hormone receptor and retinoid $X$ receptor. MCT8, monocarboxylate transporter 8.
more. Both receptors bind to DNA response elements, predominately as heterodimers in association with the retinoid $\mathbf{X}$ receptor (RXR), and alter the transcription of specific genes.

Biologically, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is much more important than $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. This statement may be surprising inasmuch as the total concentration of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ in the circulation is $\sim 50$-fold higher than that of total $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Nevertheless, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ has greater biological activity for three reasons. First, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ is bound (only 0.01 to $0.02 \%$ is free) more tightly to plasma proteins than is $\mathrm{T}_{3}(0.50 \%$ is free). The net effect is that the amounts of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and free $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the circulation are comparable. Second, because the target cell converts some $\mathrm{T}_{4}$-once it has entered the cell-to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, it turns out that $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are present at similar concentrations in the cytoplasm of target cells. Third, the TR in the nucleus has $\sim 10$-fold greater affinity for $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ than for $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, so that $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is more potent on a molar basis. As a result, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ is responsible for $\sim 90 \%$ of the occupancy of TRs in the euthyroid state. (5) N49-3

When $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ binds to the TR in the nucleus, the hormone-bound receptor either activates or represses the transcription of specific genes. As discussed above, TR preferentially binds to DNA as a heterodimer of TR and RXR (see Table 3-6). TR belongs to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that may contain domains A through F (see Fig. 3-14). Three regions are especially important for TR: (1) The amino-terminal A/B region contains the first of two transactivation domains, which are responsible for transducing receptor binding into a conformational change in the DNA and thereby initiating transcription. (2) The middle or C region is responsible for DNA binding through two zinc fingers (see p. 82) as well as dimerization between receptors.
(3) the E region, toward the carboxyl terminus, is responsible for binding the ligand $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right.$ or $\left.\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$, and also for dimerization.

## Thyroid hormones can also act by nongenomic pathways

In addition to binding to receptors in the nucleus, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ bind to sites in the cytosol, microsomes, and mitochondria. This observation has raised the issue of whether thyroid hormones exert actions through mechanisms not involving transcriptional regulation. Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormones have been observed in several tissues, including heart, muscle, fat, and pituitary. Thyroid hormones can act via nongenomic pathways to enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation-or at least energy expenditure as measured by $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. Nongenomic targets of thyroid hormones include ion channels, second messengers, and protein kinases. It is less clear whether these actions occur via $\mathrm{TR} \alpha$ or $\mathrm{TR} \beta$-similar to the nongenomic actions of estrogens, which involve the estradiol receptor (see p. 989)or whether other high-affinity thyroid-binding proteins are involved.

## Thyroid hormones increase basal metabolic rate by stimulating futile cycles of catabolism and anabolism

Investigators have long observed that excess thyroid hormone raises the basal metabolic rate (BMR) as measured by either heat production (direct calorimetry) or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption (indirect calorimetry). Conversely, thyroid hormone deficiency is accompanied by a decrease in BMR. Figure 49-6 illustrates the effect of thyroid hormone levels on BMR, and Table 49-1 summarizes the effect of the thyroid hormones

# N49-3 Sick Euthyroid Syndrome 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

Many hospitalized patients who are extremely ill exhibit abnormal results on thyroid function tests. However, the thyroid activity of most of these patients is actually appropriate and needs no correction. Many of these patients are in an intensive care unit (ICU) setting, and it is extremely important to distinguish true thyroid disease from this so-called sick euthyroid syndrome.

Sick euthyroid syndrome can take many forms, but the most common is a low or lower-than-normal total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ level and a low $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ level. In true hypothyroidism, the diminished levels of thyroid hormones decrease feedback inhibition on the pituitary gland and lead to increased levels of TSH (see p. 1014). In sick euthyroid syndrome, the TSH level is usually normal. Although the reasons for this situation are not completely understood, at least one explanation may lie in the distinction between type 1 deiodinase, which is found in the periphery, and type 2 deiodinase, which is present in the pituitary. In sick euthyroid syndrome, the activity of type 1 or peripheral $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$ deiodinase decreases, so that there is less conversion of peripheral $T_{4}$ to $T_{3}$, but more conversion to $t T_{3}$. As a result, peripheral $T_{3}$ levels fall. However, as was described in the main text with regard to starvation, type 2 deiodinase is not affected by stress nearly as much as is type 1 deiodinase; therefore, the pituitary gland continues to sense normal levels of $T_{3}$, and it responds to what it perceives as normal levels of feedback inhibition from local $T_{3}$ on the production and release of TSH. However, other factors must also be involved, inasmuch as this mechanism does not adequately account for the decrease in total $\mathrm{T}_{4}$.

Patients with sick euthyroid syndrome may appear profoundly hypothyroid, exhibiting hypothermia and a sluggish sensorium, but they are not hypothyroid, and they should not receive thyroid hormone replacement. In fact, treating sick euthyroid patients with thyroid hormone yields either no improvement or a worse outcome.

Figure 49-6 Effect of thyroid hormone on BMR. This graph shows the dependence of BMR on the daily rate of thyroid hormone secretion ( $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ ). We use the secretion rate because it is difficult to know whether to use free $T_{4}$ or free $T_{3}$. Thus, the secretion rate is a crude measure of effective thyroid hormone levels. (Data from Guyton AC, Hall JE: Textbook of Medical Physiology, 9th ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1996.)

on several parameters. Thyroid hormones increase the BMR by stimulating both catabolic and anabolic reactions in pathways affecting fats, carbohydrates, and proteins.

Carbohydrate Metabolism Thyroid hormones raise the rate of hepatic glucose production, principally by increasing
hepatic gluconeogenic activity (see p. 1176). This effect generally does not result in increases in plasma [glucose], provided the pancreas responds by augmenting insulin secretion. Thyroid hormones also enhance the availability of the starting materials required for increased gluconeogenic activity (i.e., amino acids and glycerol), and they specifically induce the expression of several key gluconeogenic enzymes, including phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, pyruvate carboxylase, and glucose 6-phosphatase.

Protein Metabolism The amino acids required for increased hepatic gluconeogenesis stimulated by thyroid hormones come from increased proteolysis, predominantly in muscle. Thyroid hormones also increase protein synthesis. Because the increases in protein degradation usually outweigh the increases in synthesis, a net loss of muscle protein occurs. The catabolic effect is exaggerated when $T_{3}$ is present in great excess, so that muscle wasting and weakness, as well as increased nitrogen loss in the urine as urea (see pp. 770-772 and 965), can be prominent features of clinical thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism).

Lipid Metabolism Thyroid hormones increase the degradation of stored triacylglycerols in adipose tissue, releasing fatty acids (FAs) and glycerol. The FAs provide fuel for the liver to support the energy demand of gluconeogenesis, and the glycerol provides some of the starting material for gluconeogenesis. Thyroid hormones not only increase lipolysis but also enhance lipogenesis. Indeed, modest amounts of thyroid hormones are needed for the normal synthesis of FAs by liver. Very high levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ shift the balance in favor of lipolysis, with resulting generalized fat mobilization and loss of body fat stores.

By accelerating the rates of glucose production, protein synthesis and degradation, as well as lipogenesis and lipolysis, the thyroid hormones stimulate energy consumption. Therefore, to the extent that thyroid hormones stimulate both synthesis and degradation, they promote futile cycles that contribute significantly to the increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption seen in thyrotoxicosis (hyperthyroidism).

How, at the molecular level, thyroid hormones affect the BMR in states of both spontaneous and experimentally induced thyroid hormone excess or deficiency has been a difficult question to answer. The changes in metabolic rate do not appear to be determined by changes in the expression of a single gene. Several specific examples of the effects of thyroid hormones on target tissues serve to illustrate their general mechanism of action.

Na-K Pump Activity In muscle, liver, and kidney, thyroid hormone-induced increases in oxygen consumption are paralleled by increases in the activity of the Na-K pump in the plasma membrane (see pp. 115-117). This increase in transport is the result, at least in part, of an increase in the synthesis of new transporter units that are inserted into the plasma membrane. At least in some tissues, the blockade of the increases in Na-K pump activity with ouabain also blocks the increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ stimulates the transcription of the genes for both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. In addition, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ increases translation by stabilizing the mRNA that encodes the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. Increases in pump activity consume additional ATP, which results in increased

$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and heat generation. Inasmuch as states of thyroid hormone excess are not accompanied by any noticeable derangement of plasma electrolyte levels, presumably the increase in $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump activity is compensated in some manner by a leak of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, although such pathways have not yet been defined. Overall, the increased activity of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (with an accompanying cation leak) would result in a futile cycle in which energy was consumed without useful work.

Thermogenesis In rodents, thyroid hormones may affect metabolic rate and thermogenesis through another futile cycle mechanism. Brown fat in these animals expresses a mitochondrial uncoupling protein (UCP), or thermogenin, that dissociates oxidative phosphorylation from ATP generation. Thus, mitochondria consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and produce heat without generating ATP. Both $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\beta$-adrenergic stimulation (acting through the $\beta_{3}$ receptor) enhance respiration in brown adipose tissue by stimulating this uncoupling mechanism. We discuss thermogenin-and the vital role it plays in helping to keep newborn humans warm-on page 1166.

Thyroid hormones also increase the BMR by increasing the thermogenic effects of other processes. An example is the effect of adrenergic stimulation on thermogenesis, discussed above. In humans, plasma concentrations of catecholamines are normal in states of both excess and deficient $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. However, excess thyroid hormone raises the sensitivity of tissues to the action of adrenergic hormones. In heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue, this effect is the result, at least in part, of increased expression of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-adrenergic receptors by these tissues. In patients who are acutely thyrotoxic, treatment with $\beta$-receptor antagonists is one of the first priorities. This treatment blunts the hypersympathetic state induced by the excess of thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones may also exert postreceptor effects that enhance adrenergic tone. In the heart, thyroid hormones also regulate the expression of specific forms of myosin heavy chain. Specifically, in rodents, thyroid hormone increases the expression of the myosin $\alpha$ chain, thereby favoring the $\alpha / \alpha$ isoform of myosin heavy chain (see Table 9-1). This isoform is associated with greater activity of both actin and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated ATPase, faster fiber shortening, and greater contractility.

## Thyroid hormones are essential for normal growth and development

In amphibians, thyroid hormone regulates the process of metamorphosis. Removing the thyroid gland from tadpoles causes development to arrest at the tadpole stage. Early administration of excess thyroid hormone can initiate premature metamorphosis. Iodothyronines are present even farther down the phylogenetic tree, at least as far as primitive chordates, although these animals lack a thyroid gland per se. However, the biological actions of iodothyronines in many species are not known.

Thyroid hormones are essential for normal human development as well, as starkly illustrated by the unfortunate condition of cretinism in regions of endemic iodine deficiency. Cretinism is characterized by profound mental retardation, short stature, delay in motor development, coarse hair, and a protuberant abdomen. Correction of iodine deficiency has essentially eliminated endemic cretinism in developed nations. Sporadic cases continue to occur, however, as a result of congenital defects in thyroid hormone synthesis. If hypothyroidism (Box 49-3) is recognized and corrected within 7 to 14 days after birth, development-including mental development-can proceed almost normally. Once the clinical signs of congenital hypothyroidism become apparent, the developmental abnormalities in the CNS are irreversible. For this reason, all U.S. states and territories conduct laboratory screening of newborns for hypothyroidism. This screening has shown that the overall rate of congenital hypothyroidism is $\sim 0.3 \%$ and varies considerably across racial and ethnic groups, being lower in African Americans ( $\sim 0.1 \%$ ) and higher in Hispanic infants ( $\sim 0.6 \%$ ).

## BOX 49-3 Hypothyroidism

Hypothyroidism is one of the most common of all endocrine illnesses, affecting between $1 \%$ and $2 \%$ of all adults at some time in their lives. Women are much more commonly affected than men. Although hypothyroidism has several causes, the most common cause worldwide is iodine deficiency. In the United States, by far the most common cause is an autoimmune disorder called Hashimoto thyroiditis. Like Graves disease, Hashimoto thyroiditis is caused by an abnormal immune response that includes the production of antithyroid antibodies-in this case, antibodies against the thyroid follicular cells, microsomes, and TSH receptors. Unlike in Graves disease, the antibodies in Hashimoto thyroiditis are not stimulatory, but rather are part of an immune process that blocks and destroys thyroid function. The titers of these autoantibodies can reach colossal proportions.

Typically, hypothyroidism in Hashimoto thyroiditis is an insidious process that develops slowly; indeed, many patients are diagnosed long before striking clinical manifestations are apparent when routine blood tests reveal an elevated TSH level despite normal levels of $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$. These individuals, although not yet clinically hypothyroid, are sometimes treated with thyroid hormone replacement, so the clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism are never given a chance to develop.

In patients in whom the disease does evolve, the classical presentation consists of painless goiter, skin changes, peripheral edema, constipation, headache, joint aches, fatigue, and, in women, anovulation. The TSH level should be checked in any female patient with secondary amenorrhea. A subset of these Hashimoto thyroiditis patients may also develop other autoimmune endocrine deficiency disorders. Those with multiple endocrine deficiency type 1 have insufficient production of parathyroid, adrenal, and thyroid hormones. Those with multiple endocrine deficiency type 2 have insufficiencies in pancreatic islet $\beta$-cell (i.e., insulin), adrenal, and thyroid hormones. Other nonendocrine autoimmune diseases (e.g., pernicious anemia, myasthenia gravis) also are associated with autoimmune thyroid disease.

Like patients with hyperthyroidism, who may be threatened by thyroid storm, those with hypothyroidism have their own severe, life-threatening variant, in this case called myxedema coma. This malady is quite rare and occurs most commonly in elderly patients with established hypothyroidism. Hypothermia and coma evolve slowly in these patients, and the usual causes are failure to take prescribed thyroid hormone replacement drugs, cold exposure, sepsis, heart failure, and alcohol abuse.

Figure 49-7 Effect of thyroid hormone on growth and development. The graph shows developmental age-that is, the age that the child appears to be based on height, bone radiography, and mental function-versus chronological age. For a normal child, the relationship is the straight line (red), for which developmental and chronological age are identical. The three green curves are growth curves for a child with thyroid hormone deficiency. Notice that at age 4.5 years, before initiation of therapy, height age, bone age, and mental age are all substantially below normal. Initiating replacement therapy with thyroid hormone at age 4.5 causes a rapid increase in both height age and bone age ("catch-up") but has no effect on mental age, which remains infantile. Treatment can help mental development only if the therapy is begun within a few days of birth. (Data from Wilkins L: The Diagnosis and Treatment of Endocrine Disorders of Childhood and Adolescence. Springfield, IL, Charles C Thomas, 1965.)

Typically overshadowed by the impaired cognitive development that occurs in cretinism is the dwarfism that results from the effects of thyroid hormone deficiency on human growth (Fig. 49-7). In children with normal thyroid function at birth, development of hypothyroidism at any time before the fusion of the epiphyses of the long bones leads to growth retardation or arrest. Much of the loss in height that occurs can be recovered after thyroid hormone treatment is begun, a phenomenon called catch-up growth. If the diagnosis and treatment of hypothyroidism are delayed, loss of potential growth may occur, as indicated in Figure 49-7. However, as noted above, mental development does not catch up unless the treatment is begun within 7 to 14 days of birth. In general, the longer the duration of congenital hypothyroidism, the more profound is the mental retardation. In rodents, thyroid hormone regulates the induction of expression of several neural proteins, including myelin basic protein (MBP; see Table 11-4). How deficiencies in these proteins result in the generalized cortical atrophy seen in human infantile hypothyroidism is not clear.

The growth curve (i.e., a plot of the child's height and weight versus age) can provide a particularly sensitive early indicator of hypothyroidism in children who develop hypothyroidism after the neonatal period. An overactive thyroid is much less a problem than is an underactive thyroid with regard to its effect on growth; other signs and symptoms of an overactive thyroid predominate.

Cellular explanations of the effects of thyroid hormones on human development are incomplete. In rats, thyroid hormone induces the secretion of pituitary growth hormone (GH); thus, the growth retardation in thyroid-deficient rats may be partly the result of decreased GH secretion. However, in humans, who have no thyroid hormone response element in the promoter region of the GH gene, plasma $[\mathrm{GH}]$ is normal in hypothyroidism. Thus, the growth failure of hypothyroid human infants is not as readily explained. In humans, changes in the growth of long bones are more or less characteristic of thyroid hormone deficiency. These changes include a delay in formation of centers of ossification at the growth plate, followed by the appearance of several ossification centers, which eventually merge. Short stature in human juvenile or infantile hypothyroidism may be in part related to these abnormalities of cartilage growth and development as well as to resistance to the normal action of GH to promote growth.

## HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-THYROID AXIS

The pituitary regulates the synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones through the release of thyrotropin-also known as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-from the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamus, in turn, stimulates the release of TSH through thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Finally, circulating thyroid hormones exert feedback control on both TRH and TSH secretion.

## TRH from the hypothalamus stimulates thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary to secrete TSH, which stimulates $\mathrm{T}_{4} / \mathrm{T}_{3}$ synthesis

Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone TRH is a tripeptide pyro-Glu-His-Pro containing the modified amino acid pyro-Glu. It is found in many tissues, including the cerebral cortex, multiple areas of the GI tract, and the $\beta$ cells of the pancreas. However, the arcuate nucleus and the median eminence of the hypothalamus appear to be the major sources of the TRH that stimulates TSH synthesis and secretion (Fig. 49-8). TRH released by neurons in the hypothalamus travels to the anterior pituitary through the hypophyseal portal system (see p. 978). Hypothalamic lesions that interrupt TRH release or delivery cause a fall in basal TSH levels. Conversely, administering TRH intravenously can cause a rapid, dosedependent release of TSH from the anterior pituitary. However, it is not clear that such bursts of TRH release and TSH secretion occur physiologically.

TRH Receptor Once it reaches the thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary, TRH binds to the TRH receptor, a G proteincoupled receptor on the cell membranes of the thyrotrophs. TRH binding triggers the phospholipase C pathway (see p. 58). The formation of diacylglycerols (DAGs) stimulates protein kinase C and leads to protein phosphorylation. The simultaneous release of inositol trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from internal stores, raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The result is an increase in both the synthesis and release of TSH, which is stored in secretory granules. TRH produces some of its

![bo316000512f](bo316000512f.jpg)

Figure 49-8 Hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Small-bodied neurons in the arcuate nucleus and median eminence of the hypothalamus secrete TRH, a tripeptide that reaches the thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary via the long portal veins. TRH binds to a G protein-coupled receptor on the thyrotroph membrane, triggering the $\mathrm{DAG} / \mathrm{IP}_{3}$ pathway; stimulation of this pathway leads to protein phosphorylation and a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. These pathways stimulate the thyrotrophs to synthesize and release TSH, which is a 2B-4Da glycoprotein stored in secretory granules. The TSH binds to receptors on the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, stimulating $\mathrm{Ga}_{\mathrm{s}}$, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase and raises [cAMP]. As outlined in Figure 49-3, TSH stimulates a number of steps in the synthesis and release of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Inside the pituitary, the type 2 form of $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-monodeiodinase converts $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, which negatively feeds back on the thyrotrophs as well as on the TRH-secreting neurons. Somatostatin and dopamine-released by hypothalamic neurons-inhibit TSH release and thus can influence the set-point at which TSH is released in response to a given amount of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ in the pituitary. AC, adenylyl cyclase; MCT8, monocarboxylate transporter 8; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C.

effects by activating phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, a process leading to the release of arachidonic acid and the formation of a variety of biologically active eicosanoids (see pp. 62-64). In healthy humans, administering TRH also raises plasma [prolactin] by stimulating lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary (see p. 1150). However, no evidence indicates a regulatory role for TRH in prolactin secretion or milk production.

Thyrotropin The thyrotrophs represent a relatively small number of cells in the anterior pituitary. The TSH that they release is a $28-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein with $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains. The $\alpha$ chain of TSH is identical to that of the other glycoprotein hormones: the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). The $\beta$ chain is unique to TSH and confers the specificity of the hormone. Once secreted, TSH acts on the thyroid follicular cell via a specific receptor.

TSH Receptor The TSH receptor on the thyroid follicular cells is a G protein-coupled receptor. Like receptors for the other glycoprotein hormones (LH, FSH, and hCG), the TSH receptor, via $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$, activates adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53). The rise in [cAMP], stimulates a diverse range of physiological processes or events, summarized in Figure 49-3:

1. Iodide uptake by NIS on the basolateral membrane of the thyroid follicular cell. Stimulation of this cotransporter allows for trapping of dietary iodine within the thyroid gland (including follicular cells and colloid). The ratio of thyroid to serum iodine (the so-called thyroid/serum or T/S ratio) is $30: 1$ in euthyroid individuals. The T/S ratio decreases under conditions of low TSH (e.g., hypophysectomy), and increases under conditions of high TSH (e.g., a TSH-secreting pituitary adenoma).
2. Iodination of thyroglobulin in the follicular lumen.
3. Conjugation of iodinated tyrosines to form $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ within the thyroglobulin molecule.
4. Endocytosis of iodinated thyroglobulin into the follicular cells from thyroid colloid.
5. Proteolysis of the iodinated thyroglobulin in the follicular cell.
6. Secretion of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ into the circulation.
7. Hyperplasia of the thyroid gland because of the growthpromoting effects of TSH.

Figure 49-9 illustrates the goiter that occurs when TSH concentrations are elevated for a prolonged period and stimulate an otherwise normal thyroid gland (see Box 49-1). Hyperplasia of the thyroid gland also occurs in Graves disease (Box 49-4) because of stimulation of the TSH receptor by a thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (see p. 1017). In contrast, the chronic elevation of TSH typically seen when the thyroid gland undergoes autoimmune destruction of follicular cells (Hashimoto thyroiditis) does not lead to follicular hypertrophy, but the gland may increase modestly in size from infiltration by immune cells.

## $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ exerts negative feedback on TSH secretion

Circulating free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ inhibit both the synthesis of TRH by hypothalamic neurons and the release of TSH by the thyrotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Plasma [TSH] is very sensitive to alteration in the levels of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$; a $50 \%$

Figure 49-9 Goiter in iodine deficiency. A young woman from a region in Central Africa where iodine deficiency is prevalent exhibits a large goiter secondary to iodine deficiency and the growth-promoting effects of TSH, the levels of which are part of a feedback mechanism for achieving a sufficient amount of thyroid hormone.
decline in free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ levels can cause plasma [TSH] to increase 50 - to 100 -fold. Conversely, as may be expected of a wellfunctioning feedback system, an excess of thyroid hormone leads to a decrease in plasma [TSH].

At the level of the thyrotroph, the sensor in this feedback system monitors the concentration of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ inside the thyrotroph (see Fig. 49-8). As noted above, either $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ can enter directly from the blood plasma, or $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ can form inside the thyrotroph by deiodination of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$. The negative feedback of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ on TSH release occurs at the level of the pituitary thyrotroph by both indirect and direct mechanisms. In the indirect feedback pathway, intracellular $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ decreases the number of TRH receptors on the surface of the thyrotroph. As a result, thyroid hormones indirectly inhibit TSH release by reducing the sensitivity of the thyrotrophs to TRH. In the direct feedback pathway, intracellular $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ inhibits the synthesis of both the $\alpha$ and the $\beta$ chains of TSH. Indeed, both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ TSH genes have $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ response elements in their promoter regions. These response elements, which are inhibitory, differ from those found in genes that are positively regulated by $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ (e.g., Na-K pump).

Free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ concentrations in the plasma, which determine intracellular $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels in the thyrotroph, are relatively constant over the course of 24 hours, a finding reflecting the long half-lives of both $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ (see p. 1009). Given that the levels of $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ are the primary triggers in the afferent limb of the negative feedback for the hypothalamic-pituitarythyroid axis, the feedback regulation of TSH secretion by

## BOX 49-4 Graves Disease

Surprisingly, it is not uncommon for B lymphocytes to synthesize immunoglobulins that bind to and activate the TSH receptor, thereby reproducing all the actions of TSH on the thyroid. Unfortunately, these errant lymphocytes do not regulate the production of these immunoglobulins in a manner analogous to the regulation of TSH secretion by the pituitary. As a result, iodine trapping by the thyroid increases, the synthesis and secretion of both $T_{3}$ and $T_{4}$ increase, and the thyroid enlarges to produce a goiter. Untreated, the affected individual becomes increasingly hyperthyroid. (5) N49-4 The clinical manifestations of hyperthyroidism include an increased metabolic rate with associated weight loss, sweating and heat intolerance, a rapid and more forceful heartbeat, muscle weakness and wasting, tremulousness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in hair growth and skin texture. Because TSH stimulates all areas of the thyroid, the thyroid is symmetrically enlarged, and even the isthmus is frequently palpable and visible on clinical examination.

The abnormal immunoglobulin is designated thyroidstimulating immunoglobulin (TSI). The constellation of symptoms noted previously, together with a symmetrical goiter, is called Graves disease after Robert Graves, who provided one of the first detailed descriptions of the disorder in the early 19th century. In some patients these antibodies are also able to stimulate connective tissue in the extraocular muscles and in the dermis of the lower extremity to synthesize mucopolysaccharides, which leads to thickening of both the muscle and the dermis. Therefore, in addition to the abnormalities of thyroid growth and hyperfunction, a minority of individuals with Graves disease develop a peculiar infiltrative abnormality in the extraocular muscles. When severe, this infiltrative ophthalmopathy impairs muscle function and causes diplopia (double vision) and a forward protrusion of the eyes (exophthalmos). Even less frequently, patients with Graves disease develop infiltrating dermopathy in the skin over the lower legs called pretibial myxedema. This thickening of the skin occurs in localized patches and is pathologically distinct from the generalized thickening and coarsening of the skin seen in hypothyroidism (generalized myxedema).
thyroid hormones appears to be a slow process-essentially integrating thyroid hormone levels over time. Indeed, $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ feeds back on the thyrotroph by modulating gene transcription, which by its very nature is a slow process.

The feedback of $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ on the release of TSH may also be under the control of somatostatin and dopamine, which travel from the hypothalamus to the thyrotrophs through the portal vessels (see Fig. 49-8). Somatostatin and dopamine both inhibit TSH secretion, apparently by making the thyrotroph more sensitive to inhibition by intracellular $\mathrm{T}_{3}$-that is, shifting the set-point for $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. Thus, somatostatin and dopamine appear to counterbalance the stimulatory effect of TRH. Although these inhibitory effects are readily demonstrated with pharmacological infusion of these agents, their physiological role in the regulation of TSH secretion appears small. In particular, with long-term administration of somatostatin or dopamine, compensatory mechanisms appear to override any inhibition.

A special example of feedback between $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and TSH is seen in neonates of mothers with abnormal levels of $\mathrm{T}_{3}$. If the mother is hyperthyroid, both she and the fetus will have low TSH levels because $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ crosses the placenta. After

## BOX 49-5 Clinical Assessment of Thyroid Function

## Plasma TSH Levels

Direct measurements of $\mathrm{T}_{4} / \mathrm{T}_{3}$ provide a measure of total circulating hormone (i.e., the sum of free $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, as well as $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ bound to TBG, TTR, and albumin; see pp. 10081009). However, these direct measurements do not allow one to distinguish between bound and free $\mathrm{T}_{4} / \mathrm{T}_{3}$. The sensitive response of TSH to changes in thyroid hormone levels provides an extremely valuable tool for assessing whether the free $\mathrm{T}_{4} / \mathrm{T}_{3}$ levels in the circulation are deficient, sufficient, or excessive. Indeed, the level of TSH reflects the amount of free, biologically active thyroid hormone in the target tissue. As a result, in recent years, measurements of plasma TSH, using very sensitive immunoassay methods, have come to be regarded as the single best measure of thyroid hormone status. Obviously, this approach is valid only if the thyrotrophs themselves are able to respond to $\mathrm{T}_{3} / \mathrm{T}_{4}$-that is, if patients show no evidence of pituitary dysfunction.

The health of the thyrotrophs themselves can be tested by injecting a bolus of synthetic TRH and monitoring changes in plasma [TSH]. In hypothyroid patients, the subsequent rise in plasma [TSH] is more dramatic than in physiologically normal individuals. This test was of great value in confirming the diagnosis of hypothyroidism before the advent of today's ultrasensitive assays, but it has largely been abandoned.

## Radioactive Iodine Uptake

Determining the amount of a standard bolus of radioactive iodine- ${ }^{125}$ ) (half-life, 13 hours) or ${ }^{131}$ ) (half-life, 8 days)—that the thyroid can take up was also once widespread as a measure of thyroid function. A hyperactive gland will take up increased amounts of the tracer, whereas an underactive gland will take up subnormal amounts. Today, the test is used mostly for three other purposes. First, radioactive iodine uptake can show whether a solitary thyroid nodule, detected on physical examination, is "hot" (functioning) or "cold" (nonfunctioning). Cold nodules are more likely than hot ones to harbor a malignancy. Second, radioactive iodine uptake can show whether hyperthyroidism is the result of thyroid inflammation (i.e., thyroiditis), in which tracer uptake is minimal because of TSH suppression, or Graves disease, in which tracer uptake is increased because thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (see p. 1017) mimics TSH. Third, higher doses of radioactive iodine are commonly used to treat patients with hyperthyroidism. In this circumstance, the use of ${ }^{131}$ I causes radiolytic destruction of the overactive thyroid tissue. In the setting of thyroid cancer, therapists give very high doses of ${ }^{131}$ ) to deliver sufficient radiation to tumors that retain only a little of the iodine-concentrating ability of the normal thyroid.
birth, the newborn rapidly metabolizes its $\mathrm{T}_{3}$, but its TSH remains suppressed, so that the infant temporarily becomes hypothyroid. Conversely, if the mother's thyroid gland has been removed and she is hypothyroid because she is not receiving sufficient thyroid hormone replacement therapy, both she and the fetus will have high levels of circulating TSH. Immediately after birth, the newborn will be temporarily hyperthyroid (Box 49-5).

# N49-4 Thyroid Storm 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

Some patients with hyperthyroidism become extremely ill and are said to be in thyroid storm. These individuals usually have a severe illness superimposed on their hyperthyroidism, and they develop high fevers, a profound tachycardia, sweating, and restlessness. Altered mental status is common. If untreated, these patients can develop severe circulatory collapse resulting in death. Thyroid storm can be the initial presentation of hyperthyroidism or it can occur in patients already known to be hyperthyroid and treated appropriately. However, when these latter individuals experience the severe stress of a major operation, trauma, or illness, they can develop thyroid storm. This condition is a true emergency. Treatment consists of giving sodium iodide, which over the long term encourages thyroid hormone synthesis but in the short term blocks the release of already-synthesized thyroid hormones; a $\beta$ blocker to inhibit the $\beta$ adrenoceptors, whose expression is increased by the elevated levels of thyroid hormones in the blood; and a drug such as propylthiouracil (PTU), which blocks the manufacture of additional thyroid hormone by inhibiting the iodination and conjugation steps. Fluid replacement and stress doses of corticosteroids are also given to support the circulation.

# THE ADRENAL GLAND 

Eugene J. Barrett

The human adrenal glands, each weighing only $\sim 4 \mathrm{~g}$, are located above the upper pole of each kidney in the retroperitoneal space. They produce four principal hormones: cortisol, aldosterone, epinephrine (adrenaline), and norepinephrine. Each adrenal gland is composed of an inner medulla and an outer cortex (Fig. 50-1). Embryologically, the cortex is derived from mesoderm, whereas the medulla is derived from neural crest cells (see p. 261) that migrate into the developing cortex. The cortex produces two principal steroid hormones, cortisol and aldosterone, as well as several androgenic steroids. The medulla produces epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The adrenal cortex can be further divided into three cellular layers: the glomerulosa layer near the surface, the fasciculata layer in the midcortex, and the reticularis layer near the cortical-medullary junction. Aldosterone, the main mineralocorticoid in humans, is made in the glomerulosa cell layer. Cortisol, the principal glucocorticoid, is made in the fasciculata and to a small extent in the reticularis layer. The adrenal androgens-dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfated form DHEAS-are made in the reticularis layer. Although both cortisol and aldosterone are made by enzymatic modification of cholesterol and are structurally quite similar, their actions on the body differ dramatically. Cortisol is considered a glucocorticoid because it was recognized early on to increase plasma glucose levels; deficiency of cortisol can result in hypoglycemia. Aldosterone is considered a mineralocorticoid because it promotes salt and water retention by the kidney. The activities of these two hormones overlap, particularly at high hormone levels, but this distinction is still very useful in identifying their most obvious functions. DHEA and DHEAS are weak androgens (compared to testosterone or dihydrotestosterone) and little is known about the regulation of their secretion. Plasma DHEA concentrations follow a diurnal pattern like that of cortisol. DHEAS circulates at much higher concentrations and shows no diurnal fluctuation.

In the adrenal medulla, chromaffin cells produce epinephrine (or adrenaline), a catecholamine that is synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Although the primary product of the medulla is epinephrine, it also produces variable amounts of the epinephrine precursor norepinephrine. These catecholamines are distinct from the steroid hormones both structurally and functionally.

## THE ADRENAL CORTEX: CORTISOL

## Cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid hormone in humans

Steroid hormones are divided into three major classes based on their actions: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and sex steroids. Cortisol is the prototypical naturally occurring glucocorticoid. The ability of cortisol to increase plasma [glucose] largely results from its ability to enhance mobilization of amino acids from proteins in many tissues and to enhance the ability of the liver to convert these amino acids into glucose and glycogen by activating gluconeogenesis.

The structures of cortisol and aldosterone (Fig. 50-2) differ only slightly: aldosterone lacks the -OH group at position 17 and has an aldehyde (aldo) group at position 18. Despite the seemingly minor chemical difference, aldosterone at physiological concentrations has virtually no glucocorticoid activity.

Target Tissues Although classified as a glucocorticoid, cortisol affects more than the principal glucose-regulatory tissues, namely, the liver, fat, and muscle. Most body tissues, including bone, skin, other viscera, hematopoietic and lymphoid tissue, and the central nervous system (CNS), are target sites for glucocorticoid action. Although cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid in humans, in other species (e.g., the rat), corticosterone is the major glucocorticoid.

Actions Glucocorticoids have numerous actions other than their ability to raise plasma glucose levels. These actions are described below and include potent immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory activity, effects on protein and fat metabolism, behavioral effects due to actions on the CNS, and important effects on calcium and bone metabolism. Some of the diverse physiological effects of the glucocorticoids can be appreciated from clinical studies of excess glucocorticoid secretion (Cushing syndrome; Box 50-1) and glucocorticoid deficiency (Addison disease; see Box 50-1). The multiple actions of glucocorticoids, in particular, their "anti-inflammatory" action on leukocytes, has led to the development of numerous synthetic analogs that are more potent, have a longer half-life, and are more selective in their specific glucocorticoid actions than are either cortisol or corticosterone. Table 50-1 lists some of these compounds

The adrenal cortex comprises three layers that surround the medulla: glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis.

The adrenal medulla contains chromaffin cells.
and indicates their relative potency as mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids.

Most of the well-characterized actions of glucocorticoids result from their genomic actions to influence (either positively or negatively) the transcription of a variety of genes through glucocorticoid response elements (see p. 986). However, glucocorticoids also exert nongenomic actions (see p. 989) that occur promptly ( 0 to 3 hours) and are not inhibited by blockade of gene transcription.

## The adrenal zona fasciculata converts cholesterol to cortisol

Synthesis of cortisol, as for all steroid hormones, starts with cholesterol (see Fig. 50-2). Like other cells producing steroid hormones, the adrenal gland has two sources of cholesterol (see p. 985): (1) it can import cholesterol from circulating cholesterol-containing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by means of LDL receptor-mediated endocytosis

## BOX 50-1 Cushing Syndrome and Addison Disease

Glucocorticoid excess is most commonly seen clinically in individuals receiving glucocorticoids for treatment of a chronic inflammatory or neoplastic disorder. Less commonly, individuals overproduce cortisol either because of a primary cortisol-producing adrenal tumor or secondary to a pituitary tumor that produces ACTH, which in turn stimulates excess cortisol production by normal adrenal glands. In either case, the cortisol excess causes a constellation of symptoms and signs including adiposity of the trunk, neck, and facies; hypertension; loss of subcutaneous adipose and connective tissue in the extremities with associated easy bruising; loss of bone mineral; muscle weakness and wasting; and hyperglycemia. This constellation is referred to as Cushing syndrome after the famous American neurosurgeon who characterized this disorder. The specific therapy is based upon identifying whether the clinical picture arises from a tumor in the adrenal or in the pituitary gland, and then removing the culprit. When the pituitary gland is responsible, the disorder is referred to as Cushing disease. In the case of patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy, the signs and symptoms of Cushing syndrome are carefully monitored, and efforts are made to minimize these side effects. Unfortunately, all glucocorticoid drugs with anti-inflammatory actions also produce these other effects.

Glucocorticoid deficiency-which occurs in primary adrenal insufficiency, also called Addison disease, and affects both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid levels-can produce an array of symptoms and signs. Although tuberculosis was once a common cause of primary adrenal insufficiency, today autoimmune adrenal disease is the most common cause. Failure of adrenal cortical hormone secretion leads to increases in circulating concentrations of ACTH as well as other products of POMC (see p. 1023). Two of these products ( $\alpha$ MSH and $\gamma$ MSH) as well as ACTH (see p. 1023) cause skin hyperpigmentation. The lack of glucocorticoid predisposes to hypoglycemia. The combined absence of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid leads to hypotension and hyponatremia, N50-1 whereas aldosterone deficiency leads to hyperkalemia. Before the development of glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid therapy, this disorder was uniformly fatal.

# N50-1 Hyponatremia in Primary Adrenal Insufficiency 

Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron
Whereas aldosterone deficiency causes renal salt wasting, hypovolemia and hypotension do not directly cause hyponatremia (i.e., a low plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$). Rather, reduced effective circulating volume triggers the release of AVP (see pp. 846847); AVP in turn provokes thirst and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ retention in the collecting ducts, which dilutes plasma $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and creates hyponatremia.

Figure 50-2 Biosynthesis of adrenal steroids. This schematic summarizes the synthesis of the adrenal steroids-the mineralocorticoid aldosterone and the glucocorticoid cortisol-from cholesterol. The individual enzymes are shown in the horizontal and vertical boxes; they are located in either the SER or the mitochondria. The SCC enzyme that produces pregnenolone is also known as 20,22-desmolase. The chemical groups modified by each enzyme are highlighted in the reaction product. If the synthesis of cortisol is prevented by any one of several dysfunctional enzymes, other steroid products might be produced in excess. For example, a block in $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase will diminish production of both cortisol and aldosterone and increase production of the sex steroids. Certain of these pathways are shared in the biosynthesis of the androgens (see Fig. 54-6) as well as the estrogens (see Fig. 55-8).

(see p. 42), or (2) it can synthesize cholesterol de novo from acetate (see Fig. 46-16). Although both pathways provide the steroid nucleus needed for cortisol and aldosterone synthesis, circulating LDL is quantitatively more important.

In the adrenal gland, cholesterol is metabolized through a series of five reactions to make either cortisol or aldosterone. All relevant enzymes are located in either the mitochondria or smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), and except for $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $3 \beta$-HSD), belong to the family of cytochrome P-450 oxidases (Table 50-2).

1. The pathway for cortisol and aldosterone synthesis begins in the mitochondria, where the cytochrome P-450 side-chain-cleavage (SCC) enzyme (also called 20,22desmolase or $\mathrm{P}-450_{S C C}$ ) removes the long side chain (carbons 22 to 27 ) from the carbon at position 20 of the cholesterol molecule ( 27 carbon atoms). This enzyme, or the supply of substrate to it, appears to be the ratelimiting step for the overall process of steroid hormone synthesis.
2. The product of the SCC-catalyzed reaction is pregnenolone ( 21 carbon atoms), which exits the mitochondrion. The SER enzyme $3 \beta$-HSD (not a P-450 enzyme) oxidizes the hydroxyl group at position 3 of the A ring to a ketone to form progesterone.
3. A P-450 enzyme in the SER, $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase (P-450 ${ }_{517}$ ), then adds a hydroxyl group at position 17 to form $\mathbf{1 7 \alpha}$ hydroxyprogesterone. However, as shown in Figure 50-2, an alternative path to $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone exists: the $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase might first add a hydroxyl group at position 17 of pregnenolone and form $\mathbf{1 7 \alpha}$ hydroxypregnenolone, which the aforementioned $3 \beta$ HSD can then convert to $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone.
4. In the SER, $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase (P-450 ${ }_{521}$ ) adds a hydroxyl at carbon 21 to produce 11-deoxycortisol.
5. In the mitochondria, $11 \beta$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{521}$ ) adds yet another hydroxyl, this time at position 11, to produce cortisol.

The enzymes represented by the vertical bars in Figure 50-2, as well as SCC, are present in all three cellular layers of the adrenal cortex. However, $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase is not substantially present in the glomerulosa layer. Thus, the fasciculata and, to a much lesser extent, the reticularis layers synthesize cortisol.

The cells of the reticularis layers are principally responsible for androgen synthesis. These cells convert $17 \alpha$ hydroxypregnenolone and $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone into the adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione. The enzyme that catalyzes this reaction is called 17,20-desmolase; however, it turns out to be the same SER enzyme as the $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase that produced the $17 \alpha$ hydroxypregnenolone and $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone in the first place. The androgens formed by the adrenal are far less potent than either testosterone or dihydrotestosterone. However, other tissues (e.g., liver, kidney, adipose) can use $17 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to convert androstenedione to testosterone (see p. 1097). In this manner, the adrenal can contribute significant amounts of circulating androgen, particularly in women. Increases in adrenal androgen production precede by 1 to 2 years the increases in gonadal steroid production that occur with puberty. This androgen production promotes growth of pubic and axillary hair and is referred to as adrenarche (see pp. 1088-1090).

The cortisol synthesized by the adrenal cortex diffuses out of the cells and into the blood plasma. There, $\sim 90 \%$ of the cortisol is transported bound to corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), also known as transcortin, which is made in the liver. Transcortin is a 383 -amino-acid glycoprotein whose affinity for cortisol is $\sim 30$-fold higher than that for aldosterone. An additional $\sim 7 \%$ of the circulating cortisol is bound to albumin. Thus, only $3 \%$ to $4 \%$ of the circulating cortisol is free.

The clearance of cortisol from the body depends principally on the liver and kidney. An early step is the formation of an inactive metabolite, cortisone, by the action of either of two $11 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ( $11 \beta$-HSDs). $11 \beta$-HSD1 is highly expressed in certain glucocorticoid target tissues, including liver and both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue. The enzymatic reaction is reversible. Indeed, when glucocorticoids were first developed as pharmaceutical agents, it was cortisone that was used to treat patients with a variety of inflammatory disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). For some time, investigators thought that cortisone was the active principle. Only later did it become apparent that the body must convert cortisone to cortisol, which is the biologically active agent. Because excess cortisol produces insulin resistance and many features of metabolic syndrome (e.g., glucose intolerance, hypertension, dyslipidemia; see Box 51-5)-and $11 \beta$-HSD1 is expressed abundantly in adipose tissue-an interesting hypothesis is that increased $11 \beta$-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue locally produces cortisol and thus promotes the development of insulin resistance.

The second $11 \beta$-HSD isozyme ( $11 \beta$-HSD2) is expressed in the adrenal cortex (see Fig. 50-2; Box 50-2), although the adrenal gland does not normally make a significant contribution to the formation of cortisone. $11 \beta$-HSD2 is highly expressed in the renal distal tubule and collecting duct (see Fig. 35-13C), where it catalyzes an essentially irreversible conversion of cortisol to cortisone. This breakdown of cortisol allows aldosterone to regulate the relatively nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) without interference from cortisol.

## BOX 50-2 210-Hydroxylase Deficiency

Mutations can affect one or more of the enzyme steps in steroid hormone synthesis and can produce unique clinical syndromes that are a direct result of failure to manufacture a particular hormone, accumulation of excessive amounts of precursor steroids, or both. The most common of these enzymatic disorders is 210-hydroxylase deficiency. From Figure 50-2 we would predict that deficiency of this enzyme would lead to inadequate production of both glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid hormones, which is indeed what occurs. Affected infants are ill with symptoms of "salt losing" (hypotension, dehydration) and glucocorticoid deficiency (hypoglycemia). The natural reaction of the body is to attempt to overcome this deficiency by increasing the secretion of ACTH, which stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and aldosterone. ACTH also causes growth of the adrenal gland. However, if the mutant enzyme is totally inactive, no cortisol or aldosterone synthesis will occur, although all other enzymes of the pathway involved in glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid synthesis will be expressed in increased amounts. The result is greater than normal activity of SCC, 3 B-HSD, 17a-hydroxylase, and 11 B-hydroxylase, and the net effect is increased synthesis of both precursor molecules and adrenal androgens. The combination of inadequate production of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, excessive production of androgens, and enhanced growth of the adrenal gland is the classical clinical syndrome of salt-losing, virilizing congenital adrenal hyperplasia. In female infants, the presence of excessive adrenal androgen in utero results in ambiguous genitalia at birth, a condition that should alert the pediatrician to the potential diagnosis. No such clue occurs in the male infant, in whom dehydration, hypotension, and hyperkalemia are the major manifestations.

## Cortisol binds to a cytoplasmic receptor that translocates to the nucleus and modulates transcription in multiple tissues

The multiple hydroxylation reactions that convert cholesterol to cortisol result in a hydrophilic compound that, unlike cholesterol, is soluble in plasma, yet lipophilic enough to cross the plasma membrane of target tissue without requiring a membrane transporter. Cortisol, like all steroid hormones, binds to intracellular receptors within target cells (see pp. 71-72). Virtually all nucleated tissues in the body contain receptors for glucocorticoids. The glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is primarily located in the cytoplasm, where in its unbound form it is complexed to a chaperone protein (i.e., the heat shock protein hsp90, among others; see Fig. $4-15 A$ ). Binding of cortisol causes the chaperone to dissociate from the GR and this allows the cortisol-GR complex to translocate to the nucleus. There, the cortisol-receptor complex associates with glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) on the $5^{\prime}$ untranslated region of multiple genes to either enhance or diminish gene expression (see p. 90).

GRs are structurally similar to the receptors for mineralocorticoids, sex steroids, vitamin D, vitamin A, and thyroid hormone. These receptors, either homodimers or heterodimers, belong to the superfamily of nuclear receptors that contains domains A through F (see Fig. 3-14). Activity of the glucocorticoid-receptor complex requires dimerization of

## BOX 50-3 Therapy with Glucocorticoids

The variety of glucocorticoid actions on body tissues is well illustrated by considering some of the clinically observed effects of hypercortisolism in patients receiving glucocorticoid drugs. Most strikingly, the entire body habitus changes. Body fat redistributes from the extremities to the face and trunk, producing (1) increased supraclavicular and dorsal interscapular fat (buffalo hump), (2) a rounded abdomen, and (3) a rounding of the face called moon facies, caused by increased subcutaneous fat in the cheeks and submandibular region. Conversely, the wasting of fat (and some supporting tissues) in the extremities produces thinning of the skin and fragility of cutaneous blood vessels. In bone, glucocorticoids reduce mineral density (osteopenia), which can lead to osteoporosis and bone fractures. The interference with normal immune function increases both the frequency and severity of infections. Rare malignancies can develop. Wasting of muscle tissue leads to a generalized weakness that is usually most prominent in the proximal muscles of the lower extremities. Finally, as would be expected from a glucocorticoid, patients become insulin resistant and even glucose intolerant (see p. 1038) or frankly diabetic (see Box 51-5). When cortisol is overproduced endogenously (from tumors producing either ACTH or cortisol), hypertension is common. The hypertension most likely results from the weak mineralocorticoid action of cortisol. Exogenous synthetic glucocorticoid therapy rarely produces hypertension because most of these drugs lack the mineralocorticoid activity of the endogenous hormone.
two identical receptor complexes (i.e., the GR functions as a homodimer) at the near-palindromic nucleotide site of the GRE on the chromatin. Glucocorticoids mainly act by modulating gene transcription. One exception is the acute feedback effect of cortisol to block the release of preformed adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the secretory granules of pituitary corticotrophs. This glucocorticoid effect is demonstrable within seconds to minutes and may relate to an as-yet undefined effect of glucocorticoid on membrane trafficking.

Although glucocorticoids are named for their ability to increase hepatic glucose and glycogen synthesis, they affect many somatic tissues. In liver, cortisol induces the synthesis of enzymes involved in gluconeogenesis and amino-acid metabolism in support of gluconeogenesis, thus enhancing hepatic glucose production. In muscle, cortisol stimulates the breakdown of muscle protein, which releases amino acids for uptake by the liver. Similarly, cortisol promotes lipolysis in adipose tissue. The fatty acids thus released provide an alternative fuel to glucose, whereas the accompanying glycerol provides another substrate for gluconeogenesis, thereby increasing the availability of glucose. For unknown reasons, although fat is mobilized from the extremities, some is also deposited centrally (see description of moon facies in Box 50-3).

Cortisol has effects unrelated to its glucocorticoid actions that lead to its extensive clinical use in disorders like vasculitis, arthritis, malignancies, and in prevention of organ transplant rejection. Glucocorticoids also act on the cellular elements of trabecular bone (see pp. 1068-1069), decreasing the ability of osteoblasts to synthesize new bone. They also

interfere with absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the gastrointestinal tract. As a result, long-term glucocorticoid use causes osteoporosis. In addition, glucocorticoids act on the CNS and can cause a variety of effects, including alterations in mood and cognition.

## Corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus stimulates anterior pituitary corticotrophs to secrete ACTH, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to synthesize and secrete cortisol

As summarized in Figure 50-3, regulation of the synthesis and secretion of cortisol begins with the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) from hypothalamic neurons as part of either a normal daily circadian rhythm or a centrally driven stress response. CRH stimulates the release of ACTH, also called corticotropin, from the anterior pituitary. ACTH directly stimulates the adrenal fasciculata layers to synthesize and secrete cortisol. Circulating cortisol exerts negative-feedback control on the release of both ACTH and CRH.

Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Small-bodied neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (see Fig. 47-3) secrete CRH, a 41-amino-acid neuropeptide. The structure of CRH is highly conserved among species. In humans, CRH is also present in several tissues, including the pancreas and testes, as well as throughout the CNS, where it serves as a neurotransmitter. The hypothalamic neurons synthesize and release CRH via the classic secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35). Neurons store CRH in secretory vesicles located in synaptic terminals in the median eminence of the hypothalamus and can release CRH acutely in the absence of new synthesis. After release into the interstitial fluid of the median eminence, CRH enters the hypophyseal portal venous plexus (see p. 978) and travels to the anterior pituitary.

CRH Receptor CRH arriving in the anterior pituitary binds to CRH-R1, a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) on the cell membrane of corticotroph cells. Hormone binding activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$, which in turn stimulates adenylyl cyclase and raises [cAMP] (see p. 53). Subsequent stimulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activates L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, leading to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, which stimulates the exocytosis of preformed ACTH. Over a much longer time, CRH receptor activation also leads to increased gene transcription and synthesis of the ACTH precursor (discussed later).

Arginine Vasopressin Although CRH is the major regulator of ACTH secretion, the paraventricular nuclei also make another hormone, arginine vasopressin (AVP; see Fig. 40-8). AVP is also a potent ACTH secretagogue and probably plays a physiological role in the regulation of ACTH secretion during stresses like dehydration or trauma.

Adrenocorticotropic Hormone A 39-amino-acid peptide hormone secreted by the corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, ACTH can also be produced by ectopic sources, particularly by small-cell carcinomas of the lung. Pituitary corticotrophs synthesize ACTH by complex post-translational processing of a large precursor protein (i.e., a preprohor-
mone) called pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). POMC is the precursor not only for ACTH but also for a variety of peptide hormones (Fig. 50-4). In the anterior pituitary, POMC yields a long N-terminal peptide, a joining (J) peptide, ACTH, and $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-lipotropin ( $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-LPH). During fetal life and pregnancy, the intermediate pituitary lobe-a small wedge of tissue between the more familiar anterior and posterior lobes-processes the same POMC in a very different manner to yield a different array of peptides: a short N -terminal peptide, $\gamma$-melanocyte-stimulating hormone $(\gamma-\mathbf{M S H})$, J peptide, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-MSH, corticotropin-like intermediatelobe peptide (CLIP), $\gamma$-LPH, and $\beta$ endorphin. Other cells-such as the appetite-controlling POMC neurons in the hypothalamus (see p. 1002)-can also synthesize POMC.

The melanocortins include ACTH as well as $\alpha-, \beta-$, and $\gamma$-MSH and bind to a family of five GPCRs, the melanocortin receptors (MC1R to MC5R). $\alpha-\mathrm{MSH}, \gamma-\mathrm{MSH}$, and ACTH act on MC1R receptors in melanocytes to increase the dispersion of pigment granules. In some patients who greatly overproduce ACTH, hyperpigmentation is a prominent clinical finding. Whether this hyperpigmentation is the result of increased production of MSH, increased production of $\beta$-LPH (which also has MSH activity), or the melanotropic action of ACTH per se remains uncertain. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-LPH and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ LPH mobilize lipids from adipocytes in animals, although their physiological role in humans is unclear. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ endorphin has potent opioid actions in the CNS (see p. 315), but its physiological actions (if any) in the systemic circulation are not known.

ACTH Receptor In the adrenal cortex, ACTH binds to MC2R on the plasma membranes of all three steroidsecreting cell types. However, because only the cells in the fasciculata and reticularis layers have the $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase needed for synthesizing cortisol (see Fig. 50-2), these cells are the only ones that secrete cortisol in response to ACTH. ACTH appears to have few other actions at physiological concentrations. MC2R is coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein and stimulates adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53). The resulting increase in [cAMP]_{i} activates PKA, which phosphorylates a variety of proteins. A rapid effect of ACTH is to stimulate the rate-limiting step in cortisol formation; that is, the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone via the SCC enzyme. In addition, ACTH-over a longer time frame-increases the synthesis of several proteins needed for cortisol synthesis: (1) each of the P-450 enzymes involved in cortisol synthesis (see Fig. 50-2), (2) the LDL receptor required for the uptake of cholesterol from blood (see p. 42), and (3) the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase that is the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis by the adrenal (see p. 968).

Thus, ACTH promotes the acute synthesis of cortisoland, as discussed later, aldosterone to a lesser extent-by the adrenal and increases the content of adrenal enzymes involved in steroidogenesis. In the absence of pituitary ACTH, the fasciculata and reticularis layers of the adrenal cortex atrophy. The glomerulosa layer does not atrophy under these conditions because in addition to ACTH, angiotensin II (ANG II) and high levels of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$are trophic factors that act on the glomerulosa layer. The atrophy of the fasciculata and reticularis layers occurs routinely in people treated

Figure 50-3 Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. Small-bodied neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus secrete CRH, a 41-amino-acid peptide that reaches the corticotrophs in the anterior pituitary via the long portal veins. CRH binds to a GPCR on the corticotroph membrane, triggering the adenylyl cyclase (AC)-cAMP-PKA pathway. The activation of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels results in an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, that rapidly leads to the release of preformed ACTH. CRH also increases gene transcription and synthesis of the ACTH precursor, POMC. After its release by corticotrophs, ACTH binds to melanocortin-2 receptors on the cell membranes in all three layers of the adrenal cortex. This receptor triggers the AC-cAMP-PKA pathway, rapidly enhancing the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and more slowly increasing the synthesis of several proteins that are needed for cortisol synthesis. The cerebral cortex can stimulate the hypothalamic neurons to increase their secretion of CRH. Cortisol exerts negative feedback at the level of both the pituitary and hypothalamus. In addition, ACTH produced by the corticotrophs negatively feeds back on the hypothalamic neurons in a "short loop."
with glucocorticoid drugs and leaves the person with an iatrogenic form of adrenal insufficiency when use of the drug is abruptly discontinued. Conversely, chronic stimulation of the adrenals by ACTH, such as can occur with pituitary tumors (Cushing disease) or with the simple physiological ACTH excess that can occur with chronic stress, can increase the weight of the adrenals several-fold.

## Cortisol exerts negative feedback on CRH and ACTH secretion, whereas stress acts through higher CNS centers to stimulate the axis

Cortisol exerts negative-feedback control on the very axis that stimulates its secretion (see Fig. 50-3), and it does so at the level of both the anterior pituitary and hypothalamus.

Feedback to the Anterior Pituitary In the corticotrophs of the anterior pituitary, cortisol acts by binding to a cytosolic receptor, which then moves to the nucleus where it binds to GREs and modulates gene expression and thus inhibits the synthesis of both the CRH receptor and ACTH. Even though, as seen above, the POMC gene yields multiple secretory products, cortisol is the main regulator of the
transcription of POMC. In addition, elevated levels of cortisol in plasma inhibit the release of presynthesized ACTH stored in vesicles.

Feedback to the Hypothalamus The negative feedback of cortisol on the CRH-secreting neurons of the hypothalamus is less important than that on the corticotrophs discussed above. Plasma cortisol decreases the mRNA and peptide levels of CRH in paraventricular hypothalamic neurons. Cortisol also inhibits the release of presynthesized CRH. Synthetic glucocorticoids have a similar action.

Control by a Higher CNS Center CRH-secreting neurons in the hypothalamus are under higher CNS control, as illustrated by two important features of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis: (1) the circadian and pulsatile nature of ACTH and cortisol secretion, and (2) integration of signals from higher cortical centers that modulate the body's responses to a variety of stressors.

The pituitary secretes ACTH with a circadian rhythm. The suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which lies above the optic chiasm and receives input from the retina, controls the circadian rhythms of the body. Indeed, blind
![bo366000512f](bo366000512f.jpg)

Figure 50-4 Processing of POMC. The primary gene transcript is a preprohormone called pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). The processing of POMC yields a variety of peptide hormones. This processing is different in the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary. In the anterior pituitary, POMC yields a long N-terminal peptide, a joining $U l$ peptide, ACTH, and $\beta$-LPH. In the intermediate pituitary, the same POMC yields a short N-terminal peptide, $\gamma$-MSH, J peptide, $\alpha$-MSH, CLIP, $\gamma$-LPH and $\beta$-endorphin. Metabolism by the intermediate lobe is important only during fetal life and pregnancy. (Data from Wilson JD, et al (eds): Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1998.)

Figure 50-5 Rhythm of ACTH and cortisol release. The corticotrophs release ACTH in a circadian rhythm, more in the early morning hours and less late in the afternoon and early evening. Superimposed on the circadian rhythm is the effect on the corticotrophs of the pulsatile secretion of CRH by the hypothalamus. Thus, ACTH levels exhibit both circadian and pulsatile behavior. Notice that, although both ACTH and cortisol are secreted episodically, the duration of the ACTH bursts is briefer, which reflects the shorter half-life of ACTH in plasma. (Data from Wilson JD, et al (eds): Williams Textbook of Endocrinology. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1998.)
people lose their circadian rhythms. Input from hypothalamic nuclei to the corticotrophs-via both CRH and AVPappears to modulate the circadian secretion of ACTH and thus the circadian secretion of cortisol as well. As is the case for other hypothalamic releasing hormones, CRH is released in pulses. As a result, superimposed on the circadian rhythm of ACTH is the pulsatile secretion of ACTH, as shown in Figure 50-5. ACTH secretory activity is greatest in the early morning and diminishes late in the afternoon and early evening. The mechanism by which hypothalamic neurons generate pulses of secretory activity is not understood.

Other evidence of higher CNS control is the enhanced CRH secretion-and thus the enhanced ACTH secretionthat occurs in response to physical, psychological, and biochemical stress. An example of biochemical stress is hypoglycemia, which stimulates the secretion of both CRH and ACTH and thus leads to an increased release of cortisol that tends to raise blood glucose levels.

The increase in ACTH secretion that occurs nocturnally and with stress appears to result from an increased amplitude of the secretory CRH burst rather than an increased frequency of secretion episodes. Because the half-life of cortisol is much longer than that of ACTH, the period of the pulsatile changes in cortisol is longer and the magnitude of the excursions is damped in comparison with those of ACTH.

## THE ADRENAL CORTEX: ALDOSTERONE

## The mineralocorticoid aldosterone is the primary regulator of salt balance and extracellular volume

Aldosterone determines extracellular volume by controlling the extent to which the kidney excretes or reabsorbs the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ filtered at the renal glomerulus. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the extracellular space
retains water-it is the primary osmotically active particle in the extracellular space-and thus the amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that is present determines the volume of extracellular fluid (see pp. 135-136). The extracellular volume is itself a prime determinant of arterial blood pressure (see pp. 554-555), and therefore aldosterone plays an important role in the maintenance of blood pressure.

The effects of aldosterone on salt balance determine the extracellular volume and should not be confused with the effects of AVP (also known as antidiuretic hormone, or ADH ). AVP regulates the free-water balance of the body (see p. 844). Water freely passes across cell membranes and thus affects the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and other solutes throughout the body (see pp. 135-136). Unlike aldosterone, AVP makes only a small contribution to the maintenance of extracellular volume; instead, AVP regulates serum osmolality and hence the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration. Thus, to a first approximation, one can think of aldosterone as the primary regulator of extracellular volume because of its effect on renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, and AVP as the primary regulator of plasma osmolality because of its effect on free-water balance.

## The glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex synthesize aldosterone from cholesterol via progesterone

As is the case for cortisol, the adrenal cortex synthesizes aldosterone from cholesterol by using P-450 enzymes in a series of five steps. The initial steps in the synthesis of aldosterone from cholesterol follow the same synthetic pathway that cortisol-secreting cells use to generate progesterone (see Fig. 50-2). Because glomerulosa cells are the only ones that contain aldosterone synthase, these cells are the exclusive site of aldosterone synthesis.

1. The cytochrome P-450 SCC enzyme (P-450 ${ }_{\text {SCC }}$ ) produces pregnenolone from cholesterol. This enzyme-or the supply of substrate to it-appears to be the

rate-limiting step for the overall process of steroid hormone synthesis.
2. The SER enzyme $3 \beta$-HSD, which is not a P-450 enzyme, oxidizes pregnenolone to form progesterone.
3. Because glomerulosa cells have minimal $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase (P-450 ${ }_{137}$ ), they do not convert progesterone to $17 \alpha$ hydroxyprogesterone. Instead, glomerulosa cells use a $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{121}$ ) in the SER to further hydroxylate the progesterone at position 21 and to produce 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC).
4. In the mitochondria, $11 \beta$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{131}$ ) adds an -OH at position 11 to produce corticosterone. This pair of hydroxylations in steps 3 and 4 are catalyzed by the same two enzymes that produce cortisol from $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone.
5. The glomerulosa cells-but not the fasciculata and reticularis cells-also have aldosterone synthase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{\text {aldo }}$ ), which first adds an -OH group to the methyl at position 18 and then oxidizes this hydroxyl to an aldehyde group, hence the name aldosterone. This mitochondrial P-450 enzyme, also called 18 -methyloxidase, is an isoform of the same $11 \beta$-hydroxylase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{111}$ ) that catalyzes the DOC-to-corticosterone step. In fact, aldosterone synthase can catalyze all three steps between DOC and aldosterone: $11 \beta$-hydroxylation, 18 -methyl hydroxylation, and 18 -methyl oxidation.

As with cortisol, no storage pool of presynthesized aldosterone is available in the glomerulosa cell for rapid secretion. Thus, secretion of aldosterone by the adrenal is limited by the rate at which the glomerulosa cells can synthesize the hormone. Although ACTH also stimulates the production of aldosterone in the glomerulosa cell, increases in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$and the peptide hormone ANG II are physiologically more important secretagogues. These secretagogues enhance secretion by increasing the activity of enzymes acting at rate-limiting steps in aldosterone synthesis. These enzymes include the SCC enzyme, which is common to all steroid-producing cells, and aldosterone synthase, which is unique to glomerulosa cells and is responsible for formation of the C-18 aldehyde.

Once secreted, $\sim 37 \%$ of circulating aldosterone remains free in plasma. The rest weakly binds to CBG ( 21\%) or albumin ( $\sim 42 \%$ ).

## Aldosterone stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion by the renal tubule

The major action of aldosterone is to stimulate the kidney to reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water and enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Aldosterone has similar actions on salt and water transport in the colon, salivary glands, and sweat glands. MRs are also present in the myocardium, liver, brain, and other tissues, but the physiological role of mineralocorticoids in these latter tissues is unclear.

Aldosterone, like cortisol and all the other steroid hormones, acts principally by modulating gene transcription (see pp. 90-92). In the kidney, aldosterone binds to both lowand high-affinity receptors. The low-affinity receptor appears to be identical to the GR. The high-affinity receptor is a distinct MR; it has homology to the GR, particularly in the
zinc-finger region involved in DNA binding. Surprisingly, MR in the kidney has a similar affinity for aldosterone and cortisol. Because cortisol normally circulates at much higher concentrations than does aldosterone ( 5 to $20 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ versus 2 to $8 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), the biological effect of aldosterone on any potential target would be expected to be greatly overshadowed by that of cortisol. (Conversely, aldosterone has essentially no significant glucocorticoid action because aldosterone binds only weakly to its low-affinity receptor-that is, the GR.)

How then do the renal-tubule cells avoid sensing cortisol as a mineralocorticoid? As noted on page 1021, the cells that are targets for aldosterone-particularly in the initial collecting tubule and cortical collecting tubule of the kidney (see p. 766)-contain $11 \beta$-HSD2, which converts cortisol to cortisone, a steroid with a very low affinity for MR (see Fig. 35-13C). Unlike $11 \beta$-HSD1, which reversibly interconverts cortisone and cortisol, $11 \beta$-HSD2 cannot convert cortisone back to cortisol. As a result, locally within the target cell, the cortisol-to-aldosterone ratio is much smaller than the cortisol dominance seen in plasma. In fact, $11 \beta$-HSD2 is so effective at removing cortisol from the cytosol of aldosterone target tissues that cortisol behaves as only a weak mineralocorticoid despite the high affinity of cortisol for the so-called MR. Thus, the presence of $11 \beta$-HSD2 effectively confers aldosterone specificity on the MR.

In the target cells of the renal tubule, aldosterone increases the activity of several key proteins involved in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport (see pp. 765-766). It increases transcription of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, thus augmenting distal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. Aldosterone also raises the expression of apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and of an $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter. The net effect of these actions is to increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. The enhanced $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (see p. 799) appears to occur as a secondary effect to the enhanced $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. However, the stoichiometry between $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the distal tubule is not fixed.

Aldosterone regulates only that small fraction of renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption that occurs in the distal tubule and collecting duct. Although most $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption occurs in the proximal tubule by aldosterone-independent mechanisms, loss of aldosterone-mediated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption can result in significant electrolyte abnormalities, including lifethreatening hyperkalemia and, in the absence of other compensatory mechanisms, hypotension. Conversely, excess aldosterone secretion produces hypokalemia and hypertension (see p. 1030).

In addition to acting via MR, aldosterone also can exert rapid, nongenomic effects by binding to the GPCR known as GPR30 (see p. 989).

## Angiotensin II, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and ACTH all stimulate aldosterone secretion

Three secretagogues control aldosterone synthesis by the glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex. The most important is ANG II, which is a product of the renin-angiotensin cascade. An increase in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is also a powerful stimulus for aldosterone secretion and augments the response to ANG II. Third, just as ACTH promotes cortisol secretion, it

![bo386000512f](bo386000512f.jpg)

Figure 50-6 Control of aldosterone secretion. Three pathways (shown in three different colors) stimulate the glomerulosa cells of the adrenal cortex to secrete aldosterone.
also promotes the secretion of aldosterone, although this effect is weak.

Angiotensin II We introduced the renin-angiotensinaldosterone axis on pages 841-842. The liver synthesizes and secretes a very large protein called angiotensinogen, which is an $\alpha_{2}$-globulin (Fig. 50-6). Renin, which is synthesized by the granular (or juxtaglomerular) cells of the juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) in the kidney (see p. 727), is the enzyme that cleaves this angiotensinogen to form ANG I, a decapeptide. Finally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) cleaves ANG I to form the octapeptide ANG II. ACE is present in both the vascular endothelium of the lung ( 40\%) and elsewhere ( 60\%). In addition to acting as a potent secretagogue for aldosterone, ANG II exerts powerful vasoconstrictor actions on vascular smooth muscle (see Table 20-8). ANG II has a short half-life ( $<1$ minute) because plasma aminopeptidases further cleave it to the heptapeptide ANG III. (5) N50-2

On the plasma membrane of the glomerulosa cell, ANG II binds to the $\mathbf{A T}_{1}$ receptor (type 1 ANG II receptor), which couples through the $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$-mediated pathway to phospholipase C (PLC). Stimulation of PLC leads to the formation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate ( $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$; see p. 58). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). IP ${ }_{3}$ triggers the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores, thus causing a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, which activates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent enzymes such as PKC and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. These changes lead to depolarization of the glomerulosa cell's plasma membrane, opening of voltage-activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, and a sustained increase in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx from the extracellular space. This rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is primarily responsible for triggering the synthesis (i.e., secretion) of aldosterone. Aldosterone secretion increases because the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ facilitates the production of pregnenolone either by directly increasing the activity of SCC or by enhancing the delivery of cholesterol to the SCC enzyme in the mitochondria (see Fig. 50-2). In addition, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ also stimulates aldosterone synthase and in this manner enhances the conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone.

Potassium An increase in extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}\right)$ has a direct action on the glomerulosa cell (see Fig. 50-6). Several $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels maintain the normal resting potential of these cells. (5) N50-3 Thus, high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ depolarizes the plasma membrane and opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. The result is an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ that stimulates the same two steps as ANG II—production of pregnenolone from cholesterol and conversion of corticosterone to aldosterone. Unlike the situation for ANG II, the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increase induced by high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ does not require activation of PLC or release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the intracellular stores. Because increased $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ and ANG II both act by raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, they can act synergistically on glomerulosa cells.

Adrenocorticotropic Hormone ACTH stimulates aldosterone secretion by a pathway that is distinct from that of ANG II or high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ (see Fig. 50-6), but has only a minor effect. As noted for fasciculata and reticularis cells on page 1023, in glomerulosa cells MC2R is coupled via a heterotrimeric G protein to adenylyl cyclase. Increases in ACTH raise [cAMP] and activate PKA, which phosphorylates large numbers of cytosolic proteins. At some as-yet undefined level, these changes stimulate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx across the plasma membrane and enhance the synthesis and secretion of aldosterone. ACTH also enhances mineralocorticoid activity by a second mechanism: stimulation of the fasciculata cells to secrete cortisol, corticosterone, and DOC, all of which have weak mineralocorticoid activity. The hypertension seen in

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The liver synthesizes and releases into the blood the $\alpha_{2}$-globulin angiotensinogen (Agt), which is a plasma glycoprotein that consists of 452 amino acids. Its molecular weight ranges from 52 to 60 kDa , depending on the degree of glycosylation. Angiotensinogen belongs to the serpin (serine protease inhibitor) superfamily of proteins, which also includes antithrombin III (see p. 446 as well as Tables 18-4 and 18-5). The liver contains only small stores of angiotensinogen, which it constitutively secretes. Production by the liver is greatly increased during the acutephase response (see Box 18-1). Angiotensinogen is synthesized in several tissues other than liver. In addition to the 52- to 60-kDa form of angiotensinogen, a high-molecular-weight (HMW) angiotensinogen complex of 450 to 500 kDa is also present in plasma. Polymorphisms within the angiotensinogen gene may contribute to normal variations in arterial blood pressure and a tendency to develop hypertension.

The juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney-also called granular cells (see p. 727)—are specialized smooth-muscle cells of the afferent arteriole that synthesize and release both the glycoprotein renin (molecular weight 37 to 40 kDa )-pronounced ree-nin-and its inactive precursor prorenin, which is the major circulating form. Prorenin-activating enzymes on endothelial cells convert this prorenin to renin. The kidney is the major source of circulating prorenin/renin, and the liver is responsible for removing renin from the circulation. The half-life of renin in plasma is 10 to 20 minutes. Renin is an aspartyl proteinase that cleaves a leucine-valine bond near the amino ( N ) terminus of angiotensinogen to release a decapeptide called angiotensin I (ANG I), which is not biologically active. By an alternative pathway, nonrenin proteases can also produce ANG I. The full sequence of ANG I is Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu:

Agt: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-Val-Ile-His ... Ser-Thr-Ala-C

## $\downarrow$ Renin

ANG I: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-C
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE; molecular weight $\sim 200 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) is produced by and attached to endothelial cells. ACE is a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase (a zinc peptidase) that cleaves ANG I by removing the carboxy-terminal (C-terminal) dipeptide histidine-leucine and producing the octapeptide angiotensin II (ANG II). The ACE cleavage site is a phenylalanine-histidine bond. The sequence of ANG II is Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe:

ANG I: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-His-Leu-C

## $\downarrow$ ACE

ANG II: N-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe-C
ANG II has a half-life in blood of 1 to 3 minutes, indicating that a large fraction is removed in a single pass through the circulation.

ANG II acts on G protein-coupled receptors known as $\mathbf{A T}_{1}$ and $\mathbf{A T}_{2}$. In addition, two other receptors are less well characterized: $\mathrm{AT}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{AT}_{4}$. ANG IV (see below) can bind to $\mathrm{AT}_{4}$ receptors.

By an alternative pathway, non-ACE proteases can also convert ANG I to ANG II. Conversely, note that ANG I is not a specific substrate for ACE, which can cleave other peptides, including bradykinin (see pp. 553-554), enkephalins, and substance $P$.

Aminopeptidase A (also called angiotensinase A, or glutamyl aminopeptidase) further cleaves the aspartate-arginine bond on ANG II to produce the heptapeptide angiotensin III (ANG III, also called ANG-(2-8)), which has the sequence Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. ANG III, like ANG II, can also bind to AT receptors.

Aminopeptidase B (also called angiotensinase B, or arginyl aminopeptidase) finally cleaves an arginine-valine bond on ANG III to produce the hexapeptide angiotensin IV (ANG IV, also called ANG-(3-8)). The sequence of ANG IV is Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe. This metabolite is inactive.

Finally, another ANG metabolite has received attention in recent years. ANG-(1-7) consists only of the first seven amino acids of ANG I*. Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro. This heptapeptide can arise from ANG I by at least three routes:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE }} \text { ANG II } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE2 }} \text { ANG-(1-7) } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { NIV }} \text { ANG-(1-7) } \\
& \text { or } \\
& \text { ANG I } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE2 }} \text { ANG-(1-9) } \xrightarrow{\text { ACE }} \text { ANG-(1-7) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that, by the above nomenclature, ANG I is ANG-(1-10), and ANG II is ANG-(1-8). The first and third pathways involve a new enzyme called ACE2. The second is catalyzed by any in a family of enzymes called neutral endopeptidases (NEPs). ANG-(1-7) can bind to a G protein-coupled receptor called the Mas receptor and-when acting on the cardiovascular system-can elicit effects opposite those of ANG II.

## BOX 50-4 Treating Hypertension by Attacking the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Axis

Because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis plays an important role in maintaining extracellular volume and arterial pressure, pharmacologists have sought ways to disrupt this system to treat hypertension. Several agents acting on different parts of the axis are available. The aldosterone antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone are diuretics that block the action of aldosterone at the level of the MR. They are weak diuretics but are particularly useful in patients with treatment-resistant hypertension. For patients with resistant hypertension or congestive heart failure, aldosterone antagonists are usually added to one of the more common thiazide diuretics (see Box 40-3) to prevent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ wasting.

ACE inhibitors have been available for a number of years and are among the safest and best-tolerated of all antihypertensive medications. These drugs also improve the quality of life and survival of patients with heart failure. Another class of drugs, the ARBs, specifically antagonize the $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptor. These drugs offer a good alternative for those patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors. Quite recently, inhibitors of renin activity have also become available, targeting yet another site within the renin-angiotensin system to treat hypertension.
individuals who oversecrete ACTH appears to be mediated by the excess synthesis of these weak mineralocorticoids. Neither ANG II nor hyperkalemia affects the cAMP pathway triggered by ACTH (Box 50-4).

## Aldosterone exerts indirect negative feedback on the renin-angiotensin axis by increasing effective circulating volume and by lowering plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$

The feedback regulation exerted by aldosterone is indirect and occurs through its effects of both increasing salt retention (i.e., extracellular volume) and decreasing $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$.

Renin-Angiotensin Axis As discussed beginning on page 841, a decrease in effective circulating volume stimulates the granular cells of the JGA of the kidney to increase their synthesis and release of renin, which increases the generation of ANG II and, therefore, aldosterone (see Fig. 50-6). The JGA is located at the glomerular pole of the nephron, between the afferent and efferent arterioles, where the early distal tubule comes in close proximity to its own glomerulus (Fig. 50-7). Histologically, the JGA comprises specialized epithelial cells of the distal tubule called macula densa cells, as well as specialized smooth-muscle cells of the afferent arteriole, which are called granular cells or juxtaglomerular cells. Macula densa cells and granular cells communicate by means of an extracellular matrix.

Decreases in effective circulating volume-or the associated decreases in systemic arterial pressure-stimulate renin release from the granular cells of the JGA in three ways discussed on page 841. Enhanced renin release leads to

increased levels of ANG II and aldosterone. ANG II negatively feeds back on renin release directly by inhibiting renin release by granular cells (short-loop feedback). ANG II also negatively feeds back on renin release indirectly by acutely increasing systemic arterial pressure (see p. 553), thereby reducing the stimuli to release renin (see p. 841). Finally, aldosterone negatively feeds back on renin release more slowly by enhancing renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (see p. 766) and thus increasing effective circulating blood volume and blood pressure. Therefore, ANG II and aldosterone complete the regulatory feedback circuit that governs the secretion of aldosterone.

Potassium High plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$stimulates the glomerulosa cell in the adrenal cortex to synthesize and release aldosterone, which in turn stimulates the principal cells of the renal collecting duct to reabsorb more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and excrete more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (see Fig. 50-6). This excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$causes plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$to fall toward normal. As a result, stimulation of glomerulosa cells declines, aldosterone secretion falls, and the negativefeedback loop is completed. This sequence of events (i.e.,

# N50-3 K* Channel Mutations in Primary Hyperaldosteronism 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Adrenal adenomas that produce aldosterone (from glomerulosalike cells) can lead to severe "primary" hypertension. In a study by Choi and colleagues, 8 of 22 aldosterone-producing, unilateral adenomas had mutations in a G protein-activated, inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel called GIRK4 or KCNJ5 (see Table 6-2, family No. 2). The tissue samples were from the adenomas; the other cells in the body may not have had these mutations.

The authors also looked at a second group: a subset of patients with severe hypertension. Choi and colleagues found somatic mutations of KCNJ5-similar to the mutations in the adenomas-in people with bilateral adrenal hyperplasia and primary hyperaldosteronism. Thus, this is a form of hereditary hypertension.

These mutations in the two diseases cause a loss of selectivity for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$over $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the KCNJ5 channels. The resulting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance depolarizes the glomerulosa cell, activating voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels; this channel activation produces increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{c}$ and thus an increase in constitutive aldosterone secretion. This cascade explains the primary hypertension. The presence of hyperplasia or neoplasia is consistent with the idea that KCNJ5 may play a role in cell proliferation.

hyperkalemia $\rightarrow$ aldosterone secretion $\rightarrow \mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion) probably plays a vital role in preventing wide swings in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in response to episodic dietary intake of large $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loads.

Role of Aldosterone in Normal Physiology What, then, is the role of aldosterone in normal physiology? Presumably, the salt- and water-retaining properties of aldosterone are of greatest value in meeting the environmental stresses associated with limited availability of salt, water, or both. Such conditions are not prevalent in most Western societies, but they still exist in many developing countries and were probably universal in previous periods of human evolutionary history. In healthy, normotensive humans, blockade of aldosterone generation with ACE-inhibiting drugs reduces ANG II production and markedly decreases plasma aldosterone, but it causes only slight decreases in total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and blood pressure. Redundant mechanisms for maintaining blood pressure probably prevent a larger blood pressure decrease. The reason for the mild effect on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance is probably an adaptive increase in salt intake; indeed, patients with adrenal cortical insufficiency frequently crave dietary salt. In contrast to the minor effects of low aldosterone on blood pressure and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance in physiologically normal people, the effects of blocking aldosterone production can be catastrophic for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance; low aldosterone levels can result in life-threatening hyperkalemia. Potassium levels are carefully followed in patients receiving aldosterone antagonists, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and renin inhibitors (see Box 50-4).

Role of Aldosterone in Disease Aldosterone does play important roles in several pathological conditions. For example, in many patients with hypertension, ACE inhibitors or ARBs are effective in reducing blood pressure (see Box 50-4), a finding implying that their renin-angiotensinaldosterone axis was overactive. In hypotension, as occurs with hemorrhage or dehydration, aldosterone secretion increases, thus raising effective circulating volume and blood pressure.

Aldosterone secretion also increases in congestive heart failure. However, the increased salt retention in this setting is inappropriate because it results in worsening edema formation. In this case, the increase in circulating aldosterone occurs despite pre-existing volume overload. The problem in congestive heart failure is that the JGA does not perceive the very real volume overload as an increase in effective circulating volume. Indeed, the reduced cardiac output in heart failure diminishes renal glomerular filtration, partly because of decreased arterial blood pressure and partly because of enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity, which constricts the afferent arterioles of the kidney. As a result, the kidney inappropriately assumes that the extracellular volume is decreased and stimulates the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

Hyperaldosteronism was long thought to be an uncommon cause of hypertension. Now we recognize that hyperaldosteronism is responsible for $\sim 10 \%$ of hypertension and for an even greater fraction of treatment-resistant hypertension. Primary hyperaldosteronism can result from either an isolated adrenal adenoma or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia;
even more rarely, adrenal carcinoma can produce excess aldosterone. NS0-4 In patients with adenomas of the glomerulosa cell, the disorder is called Conn syndrome. Hypertension and hypokalemia frequently develop in these patients. As would be expected from feedback regulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the plasma renin concentration is characteristically suppressed in this form of hypertension.

## THE ADRENAL MEDULLA

## The adrenal medulla bridges the endocrine and sympathetic nervous systems

On page 978, we describe cells of the hypothalamus as neuroendocrine because they are part of the CNS and appear anatomically as neural tissue, yet they release peptide hormones (e.g., CRH) into the blood that act downstream on the pituitary-a classic endocrine function. The adrenal medulla is similar in many ways. The cells of the medulla, termed chromaffin cells because the catecholamines that they contain stain avidly with chromium salts, derive from neural crest cells (see p. 261) and migrate into the center of the adrenal cortex, which is derived from the mesoderm. The adrenomedullary cells synthesize and secrete epinephrine and-to a lesser extent-norepinephrine. Norepinephrine is the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (see pp. 342-343). Both the norepinephrine and epinephrine made in the adrenal medulla enter the circulation and act on distal tissues just like other hormones.

Chromaffin cells are the structural and functional equivalents of the postganglionic neurons in the sympathetic nervous system (see p. 343). The preganglionic sympathetic fibers of the splanchnic nerves, which release acetylcholine $(\mathrm{ACh})$, are the principal regulators of adrenomedullary hormone secretion.

The vascular supply to the adrenal medulla is also unusual. The medulla receives vascular input from vessels that begin in a subcapsular plexus of the adrenal cortex. The vessels then branch into a capillary network in the cortex only to merge into small venous vessels that branch into a second capillary network within the medulla. This portal blood supply (originating at the entrance to the adrenal) exposes the adrenal medulla to the highest concentrations of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids of all somatic tissues.

## Only chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla have the enzyme for epinephrine synthesis

It was first appreciated nearly a century ago that extracts of the adrenal medulla have a powerful pressor effect. Subsequent work showed that catecholamines (Fig. 50-8A)L-dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine-are all made in the adrenal medulla. Norepinephrine is found in many other somatic tissues in amounts that roughly parallel the extent of sympathetic innervation of the tissue. In other words, the norepinephrine in these other tissues is not made there but is derived from the sympathetic nerve endings in them. Virtually all the circulating epinephrine,

## N50-4 Licorice as a Cause of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Glycyrrhizic acid is a chemical that consists of glycyrrhetinic acid (3- $\beta$-hydroxy-11-oxoolean-12-en-30-oic acid) conjugated to two glucuronic acid moieties. Glycyrrhizic acid is 150 -fold sweeter than sucrose. It is naturally produced by the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra (Leguminosae) and is also present in European licorice. American licorice manufacturers generally substitute anise for glycyrrhizic acid.

Glycyrrhetinic acid and the glycyrrhetinic acid moiety of glycyrrhizic acid have the curious property that they inhibit the enzyme 11 $\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 $\beta$ HSD). This enzyme converts cortisol into cortisone. ( $\bigcirc$ N50-7 Because cortisol has a much higher affinity for the MR than does the breakdown product cortisone, inhibition of 11 $\beta \mathrm{HSD}$ produces the same symptoms as a bona fide excess of mineralocorticoids. As described on page 766, this excess leads to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention and hypertension.

These compounds also inhibit 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the surface cells of the stomach and thereby increase levels of prostaglandins that protect the stomach from acid damage. This same action may also promote the release of mucus in the airway, which is why the active compounds of licorice have been used as expectorants.

True licorice has long been used as an herbal medicine.

## N50-7 Reaction Catalyzed by $11 \beta$-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

Refer to Figure 50-2, specifically the cortisol molecule (4-pregnen-11 $\beta, 17 \alpha, 21$-triol-3,20-dione), which has two highlighted hydroxyl groups-one on the C ring at position 11 and another on the D ring at position 17. The enzyme $11 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $11 \beta$-HSD) removes one $H$ from the hydroxyl group at position 11 and another $H$ from the same carbon, yielding a ketone group ( $\mathrm{O}=\mathrm{C}$ ) at position 11. The product of this reaction is cortisone (4-pregnen-17 $\alpha, 21$ -diol-3,11,20-trione). Thus, the enzyme converts a triol (three hydroxyl groups)/dione (two ketone groups) to a diol (two hydroxyl groups)/trione (three ketone groups).

Figure 50-8 Synthesis and degradation of catecholamines. In A, the horizontal arrows indicate enhancement of the reaction. MAO, monoamine oxidase.
the principal product of the adrenal medulla, comes from the adrenal medulla.

Dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine are all synthesized from the amino acid tyrosine. Figure 50-8A summarizes the reactions involved in the synthesis of epinephrine. Figure 50-9 illustrates the cellular localization of the four enzymatic reactions, as well as the three critical transport steps that shuttle the reactants and products to their proper location.

1. The activity of the first enzyme in the pathway, tyrosine hydroxylase, which converts tyrosine to L-dopa, is rate limiting for overall synthesis. This enzyme is located within the cytosol of adrenal medullary cells as well as in sympathetic nerve terminals and in specific cells within the CNS.
2. The cytosolic enzyme amino-acid decarboxylase converts L-dopa to dopamine in numerous tissues, including the adrenal medulla.
3. A catecholamine- $\mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger (vesicular monoamine transporter 1, or VMAT1) moves the dopamine into membrane-enclosed dense-core vesicles called chromaffin granules.
4. Dopamine $\beta$-hydroxylase converts dopamine to norepinephrine by hydroxylating the $\beta$ carbon. This $\beta$-hydroxylase is localized to the inner surface of the membrane of granules within the adrenal medulla and sympathetic nerves. In the nerve terminals of postganglionic sympathetic neurons, the synthetic pathway terminates at this step, and the granules store the norepinephrine for later secretion. However, the cells of the adrenal medulla convert the norepinephrine to epinephrine in three final steps.
5. Norepinephrine formed in the secretory granules moves out into the cytosol.
6. The cytosolic enzyme phenylethanolamine- $N$ methyltransferase (PNMT) transfers a methyl group from $S$-adenosylmethionine to norepinephrine, thus creating epinephrine. Substantial amounts of this enzyme are present only in the cytosol of adrenal chromaffin cells. (5) N50-5
7. The secretory granules in the adrenal medulla take up the newly synthesized epinephrine. The same VMAT1 catecholamine- $\mathrm{H}^{+}$exchanger noted in step 3 appears to mediate this uptake of epinephrine. The proton gradient is maintained by an H pump (i.e., a vacuolar-type H-ATPase; see pp. 118-119) within the secretory vesicle membrane. Thus, in the adrenal medulla, the secretory granules store both epinephrine and norepinephrine before secretion.

Epinephrine synthesis is under the control of the CRH-ACTH-cortisol axis at two levels. First, ACTH stimulates the synthesis of L-dopa and norepinephrine. Second, cortisol transported from the adrenal cortex by the portal circulation

PNMT is the enzyme that catalyzes the last step-the addition of a methyl group-in the synthesis of epinephrine. PNMT is also present in very small amounts in the ganglion cells within the heart and in the CNS.

In addition, the kidney also has an enzyme that is an N -methyltransferase-but this enzyme is distinct from PNMT. The renal form of N -methyltransferase is also present in liver (perhaps along with a small amount of PNMT).

to the medulla upregulates PNMT in chromaffin cells. The result is synergy between the CRH-ACTH-cortisol axis and the sympathetic-epinephrine axis. Thus, the stress that is sensed and propagated by the CRH-ACTH-cortisol axis sustains the epinephrine response.

Similar to the secretory granules that are present in the postganglionic sympathetic neurons, the secretory granules of the adrenal medulla contain very high concentrations of catecholamines (as high as 0.5 M ). These catecholaminesalong with ATP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-bind to granular proteins called chromogranins and thus are not osmotically active in these storage vesicles. Chromogranins are what make dense-core vesicles dense. In humans, the dominant chromogranin is chromogranin B. The release of catecholamines is initiated by CNS control. ACh released from preganglionic neurons in the splanchnic nerves acts on nicotinic ACh receptors to depolarize the postganglionic chromaffin cells. This depolarization triggers the opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, a process that raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and triggers the exocytotic release of epinephrine. The secretion of adrenal catecholamines is accompanied by the release of ATP and the granule proteins. The release of chromogranin A has been used as a marker of adrenal medullary activity. In the circulation, the catecholamines dissociate from the binding complex and are free to act on target tissues.

The early description of the fight-or-flight response to stress (see p. 347) exemplifies the central control of adrenomedullary function. An organism faced with a severe external threat responds with centrally driven release of adrenal hormones, as well as activation of other aspects of the sympathetic nervous system. This response includes increases in heart rate and contractility, mobilization of fuel stores from muscle and fat, piloerection, pupillary dilatation, and increased sphincter tone of the bowel and bladder. Each response is in some way adapted to deal with the perceived threat successfully. This combined neuroendocrine response is activated within seconds. The secreted catecholamines act very quickly after reaching their target tissues.

The biological actions of catecholamines are very brief, lasting only $\sim 10$ seconds in the case of epinephrine. Circulating catecholamines are degraded first by the enzyme catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), which is present in high concentrations in endothelial cells and the heart, liver, and kidneys (see Fig. 50-8B). COMT converts epinephrine to metanephrine, as well as norepinephrine to normetanephrine. A second enzyme, monoamine oxidase, converts these metabolites to vanillylmandelic acid (VMA). The liver and also the gut then conjugate these compounds to sulfate (see p. 955) or glucuronide (see p. 955) to form derivatives that the kidney excretes in the urine. Determination of the

concentration of catecholamines, metanephrines, and VMA in the urine provides a measure of the total adrenal catecholamine production by both the adrenal medulla and the sympathetic system.

## Catecholamines bind to $\alpha$ and $\beta$ adrenoceptors on the cell surface and act through heterotrimeric G proteins

Many of the hormones already discussed have a unique receptor on the cell surface (e.g., insulin, parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone) or within the cell (e.g., thyroid hormones or cortisol). Other hormones (e.g., AVP) and neurotransmitters (e.g., ACh and glutamate) may bind to more than one type of receptor, each acting via a different signal-transduction process. The situation for the catecholamines is even more complex. Epinephrine and norepinephrine can each bind to more than one type of adrenergic receptor, or adrenoceptor, all of which are GPCRs. Conversely, individual adrenoceptors can generally bind both epinephrine and norepinephrine-albeit with different affinities. For their work on GPCRs, including adrenoceptors, Robert J. Lefkowitz and Brian K. Kobilka shared the 2012 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. (5) N50-6

In the late 1940s, Raymond Ahlquist found that epinephrine and epinephrine analogs could produce both excitatory and inhibitory effects, depending on the tissue. This property led to the designation of $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors (mostly associated with stimulation) and $\beta$-adrenergic receptors (mostly associated with inhibition). Moreover, certain drugs could selectively block the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ effects. This dichotomy proved to be too simple when it was observed that the actions of some drugs that have pure $\alpha$ or pure $\beta$ activity could be blocked in some tissues but not in others; this variability in response suggested that the tissue response is determined by a subtype of $\alpha$ or $\beta$ receptor.

It is now clear that at least three types of $\beta$ and two types of $\alpha$ receptors exist (see Table 14-2), as well as subtypes within these major classes. These receptors differ in primary structure and in the types of G proteins that associate with the receptor. The several $\beta$ receptors are coupled to stimulatory heterotrimeric G proteins $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ that stimulate adenylyl cyclase and thus increase levels of cAMP (see p. 53), the principal intracellular mediator of $\beta$ activation. The $\alpha_{2}$ adrenoceptors are coupled to other G proteins $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ that inhibit adenylyl cyclase and thus lower [cAMP], in target tissues. The $\alpha_{1}$ receptors are coupled to yet another heterotrimeric G protein $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}\right)$ that activates PLC (see p. 58) and thereby increases $\left[\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right]_{i}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in target tissues.

Recognition of the diversity of adrenoceptor subtypes has led to a panoply of pharmacological agents that block or stimulate one or the other of these receptor subtypes. Some drugs are nonspecific and affect several receptor subtypes; others specifically block only a single subtype. The clinical value of a particular drug depends on its spectrum of activity. Thus, for example, an agent that selectively blocks the vasoconstrictor response to norepinephrine could be a very useful antihypertensive agent, but its utility would be
compromised if it also blocked the ability of bladder smooth muscle to contract.

## The CNS-epinephrine axis provides integrated control of multiple functions

The actions of the sympathetic nervous system (see Chapter 14) in the control of blood pressure (see p. 539), heart rate (see p. 539), sweating (see p. 1218), micturition (see p. 736), and airway resistance (see p. 620) are discussed in more detail in other chapters, as indicated. Here, we mention only some of the unique actions attributed to adrenal catecholamine release that integrate several bodily functions as part of the stress response. These adrenal-mediated activities do not occur in isolation but are usually accompanied by generalized noradrenergic sympathetic discharge.

In response to the stress of simple exercise (see pp. 583 and 1210), blood flow to muscle is increased; circulating epinephrine appears to be important in this response. Circulating epinephrine also relaxes bronchial smooth muscle to meet the demand for increased ventilation and, when combined with the increased blood flow, increases oxygen delivery to the exercising muscle. Similarly, to sustain muscular activity, particularly early in exercise, epinephrine acting via the $\beta$ adrenoceptor activates the degradation of muscle glycogen to provide a ready fuel source for the contracting muscle (see p. 1182). Epinephrine also activates lipolysis in adipose tissue (see p. 1182) to furnish fatty acids for more sustained muscular activity if needed. In liver, as in muscle, epinephrine activates glycogenolysis, so that the supply of glucose is maintained in the blood.

In addition to enhancing blood flow and ventilation, the integrated response to exercise increases fuel availability by decreasing insulin levels. Circulating epinephrine, acting through a $\beta$ adrenoceptor, stimulates the secretion of insulin (see p. 1041). However, during exercise, local autonomic innervation, acting by means of an $\alpha$ adrenoceptor of the pancreas, inhibits this effect so that insulin levels fall. The net effects are to promote glycogenolysis and to allow muscle to increase its work while maintaining glycemia so that brain function is not impaired. The fleeing human must not only run, but know where to run!

Unlike in other glandular tissue, no endocrine feedback loop governs the secretion of adrenal medullary hormones. Control of catecholamine secretion resides within the CNS. This principle can be illustrated by the changes in epinephrine secretion that occur with even mild hypoglycemia. Decreases in blood glucose concentration to less than $\sim 3.5 \mathrm{mM}$ (normal concentration, $\sim 5.5 \mathrm{mM}$ ) are sensed by the CNS, which triggers a central sympathetic response that increases the firing of preganglionic fibers in the celiac plexus. This sympathetic outflow suppresses endogenous insulin secretion by the $\alpha$-adrenergic mechanism noted above, thus promoting an increase in plasma [glucose]. This sympathetic outflow to the adrenal medulla also triggers a major release of epinephrine that, through $\beta$ adrenoceptors in the liver, stimulates increased hepatic glycogenolysis. This response helps to restore plasma [glucose] to normal. Restoration of normoglycemia diminishes central sympathetic outflow (Box 50-5).

# BOX 50-5 Pheochromocytoma 

Tie dramatic biological effects of catecholamines are well illustrated by patients with pheochromocytoma. A pheochromocytoma is a relatively uncommon tumor caused by hyperplasia or more rarely neoplasia of either adrenal medullary tissue or extra-adrenal chromaffin tissue that failed to involute after birth. These tumors, which can be benign or malignant, make catecholamines, just like the normal medulla, except in an unregulated fashion. Patients with pheochromocytomas typically have a plethora of symptoms, as would be expected from such a wide-ranging hormonal system. Paroxysmal (sudden) hypertension, tachycardia, headache, episodes of sweating, anxiousness, tremor, and glucose intolerance usually dominate the clinical findings. The key to the diagnosis of this disorder is a
careful history taking, evidence on physical examination of excessive adrenergic tone, and laboratory detection of increased amounts of serum and urinary catecholamines and their metabolites. When chemical evaluation of the metabolites confirms the presence of a pheochromocytoma, it is often possible to localize the tumor to one or the other adrenal gland and resect the tumor. Rarely, both glands are affected, necessitating bilateral adrenalectomy. Such patients must subsequently receive glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement. No therapy is routinely given to replace the adrenal medullary function. It is not clear whether these individuals react less well to external stimuli that would trigger the fight-or-flight response.

# THE ENDOCRINE PANCREAS 

Eugene J. Barrett

## The islets of Langerhans are endocrine and paracrine tissue

The pancreas contains two types of glands: (1) exocrine glands, which secrete digestive enzymes (see p. 882) and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see pp. 885-886) into the intestinal lumen; and (2) endocrine glands, called the islets of Langerhans. The islets are spread throughout the pancreas and in aggregate comprise only $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of its tissue mass.

The normal human pancreas contains between 500,000 and several million islets. Islets can be oval or spherical and measure between 50 and $300 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. Islets contain at least four types of secretory cells- $\alpha$ cells, $\beta$ cells, $\delta$ cells, and F cells-in addition to various vascular and neural elements (Fig. 51-1 and Table 51-1). $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ cells secrete insulin, proinsulin, C peptide, and a newly described protein, amylin (or IAPP for islet amyloid polypeptide). $\beta$ cells are the most numerous type of secretory cell within the islets; they are located throughout the islet but are particularly numerous in the center. $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ cells principally secrete glucagon, $\boldsymbol{\delta}$ cells secrete somatostatin, and $\mathbf{F}$ cells (also called pancreatic polypeptide cells) secrete pancreatic polypeptide.

The islets are richly perfused (blood flow per gram of tissue is $>5$ times that of the myocardium) and receive both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation. These cells also can communicate with each other and influence each other's secretion. We can group these communication links into three categories:

1. Humoral communication. The blood supply of the islet courses outward from the center of the islet toward the periphery, carrying glucose and other secretagogues. In the rat-and less strikingly in humans- $\beta$ cells are more abundant in the center of the islet, whereas $\alpha$ and $\delta$ cells are more abundant in the periphery. Cells within a given islet can influence the secretion of other cells as the blood supply courses outward through the islet carrying the secreted hormonal product of each cell type with it. For example, glucagon is a potent insulin secretagogue, insulin modestly inhibits glucagon release, and somatostatin potently inhibits the secretion of both insulin and glucagon (as well as the secretion of growth hormone and other non-islet hormones).
2. Cell-cell communication. Both gap and tight junctional structures connect islet cells with one another. Cells within an islet communicate via gap junctions, which may be important for the regulation of both insulin and glucagon secretion.
3. Neural communication. Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) regulate islet secretion. Cholinergic stimulation augments insulin secretion. Adrenergic stimulation can have either a stimulatory or inhibitory effect, depending on whether $\beta$-adrenergic (stimulatory) or $\alpha$-adrenergic (inhibitory) stimulation dominates (see p. 1033). (5) N51-1

These three communication mechanisms allow for a tight control over the synthesis and secretion of islet hormones.

## INSULIN

The discovery of insulin was among the most exciting and dramatic events in the history of endocrine physiology and therapy. In the United States and Europe, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), or type 1 diabetes, develops in $\sim 1$ in every 600 children. However, the prevalence is only $\sim 1$ in 10,000 in eastern Asia. Before 1922, all children with diabetes died within 1 or 2 years of diagnosis. It was an agonizing illness; the children lost weight despite eating well, became progressively weaker and cachectic, were soon plagued by infections, and eventually died of overwhelming acidosis. No effective therapy was available, and few prospects were on the horizon. It was known that the blood sugar level was elevated in this disease, but beyond that, there was little understanding of its pathogenesis.

In 1889, Minkowski and von Mering demonstrated that removing the pancreas from dogs caused hyperglycemia, excess urination, thirst, weight loss, and death-in short, a syndrome closely resembling type 1 diabetes. Following this lead, a group of investigators in the Department of Physiology at the University of Toronto prepared extracts of pancreas and tested the ability of these extracts to lower plasma [glucose] in pancreatectomized dogs. Despite months of failures, these investigators persisted in their belief that such extracts could be beneficial. Finally, by the winter of 1921, Frederick Banting (a surgeon) and Charles Best (at the time, a medical student) were able to demonstrate that an aqueous extract of pancreas could lower blood glucose level and prolong survival in a pancreatectomized dog. (5) N51-2 Within 2 months, a more purified extract was shown to lower blood glucose level in a young man with diabetes. By the end of 1923, insulin (as the islet hormone was named) was being prepared from beef and pork pancreas on an

On page 1033, we noted that the general rule for $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-adrenergic receptors-first noted by Raymond Ahlquist-is that $\alpha$ activation leads to stimulation, whereas $\beta$ activation leads to inhibition. The pattern in pancreatic islets is just the opposite, as noted in the text.

In 1923, just 2 years after Frederick Banting (a young faculty member just 5 years out of medical school) and Charles Best (a 22-year-old medical student working in Banting's laboratory) discovered insulin at the University of Toronto, the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to Frederick Banting and the head of the research team and chairman of Banting's department, John Macleod. The short delay between the discovery and the award of the prize indicates the enormous significance of the discovery.

It is interesting that Frederick Banting protested the award of the Nobel Prize to John Macleod and gave half of his portion of the monetary award to Charles Best.

that of any other hormone. Now, nearly a century later, much is known about the metabolic pathways through which insulin regulates carbohydrate, lipid, and protein metabolism in its major targets: the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue. However, the sequence of intracellular signals that triggers insulin secretion by pancreatic $\beta$ cells, as well as the signaltransduction process triggered when insulin binds to a plasma membrane receptor on target tissues, remain areas of intense study.

## Insulin replenishes fuel reserves in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue

What does insulin do? Succinctly put, insulin efficiently integrates body fuel metabolism both during periods of fasting and during feeding (Table 51-2). When an individual is fasting, the $\beta$ cell secretes less insulin. When insulin levels decrease, lipids are mobilized from adipose tissue and amino acids are mobilized from body protein stores within muscle and other tissues. These lipids and amino acids provide fuel for oxidation and serve as precursors for hepatic ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis, respectively. During feeding, insulin secretion increases promptly, which diminishes the mobilization of endogenous fuel stores and stimulates the uptake of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids by insulin-sensitive target tissues. In this manner, insulin directs tissues to replenish the fuel reserves depleted during periods of fasting.

As a result of its ability to regulate the mobilization and storage of fuels, insulin maintains plasma [glucose] within narrow limits. Such regulation provides the central nervous system (CNS) with a constant supply of glucose needed to fuel cortical function. In higher organisms, if plasma [glucose] (normally $\cong 5 \mathrm{mM}$ ) declines to $<2$ to 3 mM (hypoglycemia; Box 51-1) for even a brief period, confusion, seizures, and coma may result. Conversely, persistent elevations of plasma [glucose] are characteristic of the diabetic state. Severe hyperglycemia (plasma glucose levels $>15 \mathrm{mM}$ )

## BOX 51-1 Clinical Manifestations of Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia

## Hypoglycemia (5) NS1-4

Early symptoms are principally autonomic and include palpitations, tachycardia, diaphoresis, anxiety, hyperventilation, shakiness, weakness, and hunger. More severe hypoglycemia manifests principally as neuroglycopenia, with confusion, aberrant behavior, hallucinations, seizures, hypothermia, focal neurological deficits, and coma.

## Hyperglycemia

Early manifestations include weakness, polyuria, polydipsia, altered vision, weight loss, and mild dehydration. For prolonged or severe hyperglycemia (accompanied by metabolic acidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis), manifestations include Kussmaul hyperventilation (deep, rapid breathing; see p. 716), stupor, coma, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmias.
produces an osmotic diuresis (see Box 35-1) that, when severe, can lead to dehydration, hypotension, and vascular collapse.

## $\beta$ cells synthesize and secrete insulin

The Insulin Gene Circulating insulin comes only from the $\beta$ cells of the pancreatic islet. It is encoded by a single gene on the short arm of chromosome 11. Exposing islets to glucose stimulates insulin synthesis and secretion. Though the process is not completely understood, this stimulation requires that the glucose be metabolized.

Insulin Synthesis Transcription of the insulin gene product and subsequent processing produces full-length messenger RNA (mRNA) that encodes preproinsulin. Starting from its $5^{\prime}$ end, this mRNA encodes a leader sequence and then peptide domains B, C, and A. Insulin is a secretory protein (see pp. 34-35). As the preprohormone is synthesized, the leader sequence of -24 amino acids is cleaved from the nascent peptide as it enters the rough endoplasmic reticulum. The result is proinsulin (Fig. 51-2), which consists of domains B, C, and A. As the trans Golgi packages the proinsulin and creates secretory granules, proteases slowly begin to cleave the proinsulin molecule at two spots and thus excise the 31 -amino-acid C peptide. The resulting insulin molecule has two peptide chains, designated the $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ chains, that are joined by two disulfide linkages. The mature insulin molecule has a total of 51 amino acids, 21 on the A chain and 30 on the B chain. In the secretory granule, the insulin associates with zinc. The secretory vesicle contains this insulin, as well as proinsulin and C peptide. All three are released into the portal blood when glucose stimulates the $\beta$ cell.

Secretion of Insulin, Proinsulin, and C Peptide C peptide has no established biological action. Yet because it is secreted in a $1: 1$ molar ratio with insulin, it is a useful marker for insulin secretion. Proinsulin does have modest insulin-like activities; it is $\sim \gamma_{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{s}}$ th as potent as insulin on a molar basis.
![bo446000512f](bo446000512f.jpg)

Figure 51-2 Synthesis and processing of the insulin molecule. The mature mRNA of the insulin gene product contains a $5^{\prime}$ untranslated region (UTR); nucleotide sequences that encode a 24 -amino-acid leader sequence, as well as B, C, and A peptide domains; and a $3^{\prime}$ UTR. Together, the leader plus the B, C, and A domains constitute preproinsulin. During translation of the mRNA, the leader sequence is cleaved in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). What remains is proinsulin, which consists of the B, C, and A domains. Beginning in the trans Golgi, proteases cleave the proinsulin at two sites, releasing the C peptide as well as the mature insulin molecule, which consists of the B and A chains that are connected by two disulfide bonds. The secretory granule contains equimolar amounts of insulin and the C peptide, as well as a small amount of proinsulin. These components all are released into the extracellular space during secretion.

# N51-4 Hypoglycemia 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

Hypoglycemia, which can be viewed most simply as the opposite of diabetes mellitus, has many causes. Perhaps the most frequent setting is a patient with type 1 diabetes who skips a meal or fails to adjust the insulin dose when exercising. Many diabetic patients who seek to maintain tight control over their blood sugar experience frequent hypoglycemic reactions, which they quickly learn to abort with a carbohydrate snack. Patients with type 2 diabetes who take an excessive dose of sulfonylureas are subject to severe hypoglycemia, which may require continuous treatment for several days because the half-life of some of these drugs is quite long.

We saw in Chapter 50 that epinephrine-acting as a $\beta$-adrenergic agonist-is a hyperglycemic agent; that is, it promotes glycogenolysis in liver and muscle (see p. 1033). Thus, $\beta$ blockers rarely cause hypoglycemia in healthy individuals because these people can appropriately regulate their insulin secretion. However, because $\beta$ blockers can mask the early adrenergic response to mild hypoglycemia (sweating, tachycardia, tremulousness), diabetic patients taking both insulin and $\beta$ blockers commonly progress to severe hypoglycemia without warning. Another drug that can induce hypoglycemia is pentamidine, an agent used to treat Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia. Pentamidine is a $\beta$-cell toxin that leads to an acute, excessive release of insulin, which can be followed by hypoglycemia.

Alcoholic patients are at great risk of hypoglycemia. Ethanol suppresses gluconeogenesis, and hepatic glycogen stores may already be low because of poor nutrition. Other severe illnesses that can produce persistent hypoglycemia include liver disease, renal failure, and some large tumors that produce a hypoglycemia-inducing peptide, usually IGF-2. Rarely, an insulinoma may develop, which is an islet cell tumor (usually benign) that releases high and unregulated concentrations of insulin into the bloodstream.

Many individuals complain of postprandial hypoglycemia, frequently called reactive hypoglycemia. Despite long years of skepticism, investigators now believe that at least some of these patients do indeed experience true symptoms of hypoglycemia within a few hours of eating. There is no absolute glucose level at which symptoms occur; many people can tolerate extremely low levels of glucose without any problems. However, a rather high rate of decline in the plasma glucose level after a meal may cause symptoms. One cause of postprandial hypoglycemia may be a delay in the timing of insulin release after a meal. Thus, the $\beta$ cells release too much insulin too late after a meal, so the blood glucose level initially rises markedly and then falls rapidly. In some patients, this defect may herald the development of diabetes mellitus.

However, the $\beta$ cell secretes only $\sim 5 \%$ as much proinsulin as insulin. As a result, proinsulin does not play a major role in the regulation of blood glucose.

Most of the insulin ( $\sim 60 \%$ ) that is secreted into the portal blood is removed in a first pass through the liver. In contrast, C peptide is not extracted by the liver at all. As a result, whereas measurements of the insulin concentration in systemic blood do not quantitatively mimic the secretion of insulin, measurements of C peptide do. C peptide is eventually excreted in the urine, and the quantity of C peptide excreted in a 24 -hour period is a rough measure of the amount of insulin released during that time.

## Glucose is the major regulator of insulin secretion

In healthy individuals, the plasma glucose concentration remains within a remarkably narrow range. After an overnight fast, it typically averages between 4 and 5 mM ; the plasma [glucose] rises after a meal, but even with a very large meal it does not exceed 10 mM . Modest increases in plasma [glucose] provoke marked increases in the secretion of insulin and C peptide and hence raise plasma [insulin], as illustrated by the results of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) as shown in Figure 51-3A. Conversely, a decline in plasma [glucose] of only $20 \%$ markedly lowers plasma [insulin]. The change in the concentration of plasma glucose that occurs in response to feeding or fasting is the main determinant of insulin secretion. In a patient with type 1 diabetes mellitus caused by destruction of pancreatic islets, an oral glucose challenge evokes either no response or a much smaller insulin response, but a much larger increment in plasma [glucose] that lasts for a much longer time (see Fig. 51-3B).

A glucose challenge of $0.5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight given as an intravenous bolus raises the plasma glucose concentration more rapidly than glucose given orally. Such a rapid rise in plasma glucose concentration leads to two distinct phases of insulin secretion (see Fig. 51-3C). The acute-phase or firstphase insulin response lasts only 2 to 5 minutes, whereas the second-phase insulin response persists as long as the blood glucose level remains elevated. The insulin released during the acute-phase insulin response to intravenous glucose arises from preformed insulin that had been packaged in

[^0]:    Figure 51-3 Glucose tolerance test results. A, When a person ingests a glucose meal ( 75 g ), plasma [glucose] (green curve) rises slowly, reflecting intestinal uptake of glucose. As a result, plasma [insulin] (solid red curve) rises sharply. When a lower glucose dose is given intravenously (IV) over time-in a manner that reproduces the green curveplasma [insulin] rises only modestly (dashed red curve). The difference between the insulin responses indicated by the solid and dashed red lines is due to the "incretin effect" of oral glucose ingestion. B, In a patient with type 1 diabetes, the same oral glucose load as that in $\mathbf{A}$ causes plasma [glucose] to rise to a higher level and to remain high for a longer time. The diagnosis of diabetes is made if the plasma glucose level is above $200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ at the second hour. C, If a large IV glucose challenge ( 0.5 g glucose $/ \mathrm{kg}$ body weight given as a $25 \%$ glucose solution) is administered as a bolus, plasma [glucose] rises much more rapidly than it does with an oral glucose load. Sensing a rapid rise in [glucose], the $\beta$ cells first secrete some of their stores of presynthesized insulin. Following this "acute phase," the cells secrete both presynthesized and newly manufactured insulin in the "chronic phase."

secretory vesicles docked at, or residing near, the $\beta$-cell plasma membrane. The second-phase insulin response also comes from preformed insulin within the vesicles with some contribution from newly synthesized insulin. One of the earliest detectable metabolic defects that occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes is loss of the first phase of insulin secretion, as determined by an intravenous glucose tolerance test. If a subject consumes glucose or a mixed meal, plasma [glucose] rises much more slowly-as in Figure 51-3A-because the appearance of glucose in plasma depends on gastric emptying and intestinal absorption. Given that plasma [glucose] rises so slowly, the acute-phase insulin response can no longer be distinguished from the chronic response, and only a single phase of insulin secretion is apparent. However, the total insulin response to an oral glucose challenge exceeds the response observed when comparable changes in plasma [glucose] are produced by intravenously administered glucose (see Fig. 51-3A). This difference is referred to as the incretin effect (Box 51-2).

## Metabolism of glucose by the $\beta$ cell triggers insulin secretion

The pancreatic $\beta$ cells take up and metabolize glucose, galactose, and mannose, and each can provoke insulin secretion by the islet. Other hexoses that are transported into the $\beta$ cell but that cannot be metabolized (e.g., 3-O-methylglucose or 2-deoxyglucose) do not stimulate insulin secretion. Although

## BOX 51-2 Nonhuman and Mutant Insulin

$\mathcal{G}$loning of the insulin gene has led to an important therapeutic advance, namely, the use of recombinant human insulin for the treatment of diabetes. Human insulin was the first recombinant protein available for routine clinical use. Before the availability of human insulin, either pork or beef insulin was used to treat diabetes. Pork and beef insulin differ from human insulin by one and three amino acids, respectively. The difference, although small, is sufficient to be recognized by the immune system, and antibodies to the injected insulin develop in most patients treated with beef or pork insulin; occasionally, the reaction is severe enough to cause a frank allergy to the insulin. This problem is largely avoided by using human insulin.

Sequencing of the insulin gene has not led to a major understanding of the genesis of the common forms of human diabetes. However, rare patients with diabetes make a mutant insulin molecule with a single amino-acid substitution in either the A or B chain. In each case that has been described, these changes lead to a less-active insulin molecule (typically only $\sim 1 \%$ as potent as insulin on a molar basis). These patients have either glucose intolerance or frank diabetes, but very high concentrations of immunoreactive insulin in their plasma. In these individuals, the immunoreactivity of insulin is not affected to the same extent as the bioactivity.

In addition to revealing these mutant types of insulin, sequencing of the insulin gene has allowed identification of a flanking polymorphic site upstream of the insulin gene that contains one of several common alleles. In some populations, certain polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of development of type 1 diabetes mellitus.
glucose itself is the best secretagogue, some amino acids (especially arginine and leucine) and small keto acids (e.g., $\alpha$-ketoisocaproate, $\alpha$-ketoglutarate), as well as ketohexoses (fructose), can also weakly stimulate insulin secretion. The amino acids and keto acids do not share any metabolic pathway with hexoses other than oxidation via the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185). These observations have led to the suggestion that the ATP generated from the metabolism of these varied substances may be involved in insulin secretion. In the laboratory, depolarizing the islet cell membrane by raising extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$provokes insulin secretion.

From these data has emerged a relatively unified picture of how various secretagogues trigger insulin secretion. Key to this picture is the presence in the islet of an ATP-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and a voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel in the plasma membrane (Fig. 51-4). The $\mathbf{K}^{+}$channel ( $\mathbf{K}_{\text {ATP }}$; see p. 198) is an octamer of four Kir6.2 channels (see p. 196) and four sulfonylurea receptors (SURs; see p. 199; Box 51-3), Glucose triggers insulin release in a seven-step process:

Step 1: Glucose enters the $\beta$ cell via the GLUT2 glucose transporter by facilitated diffusion (see p. 114). Amino acids enter through a different set of transporters.
Step 2: In the presence of glucokinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in glycolysis), the entering glucose undergoes glycolysis as well as oxidation via the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185), phosphorylating ADP and raising [ATP] ${ }_{i}$. Some amino acids also enter the citric acid cycle. In both cases, the following ratios increase: [ATP]/[ADP] ${ }_{i},[\mathrm{NADH}]_{i}$ $[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}]_{i}$, and $[\mathrm{NADPH}]_{i} /\left[\mathrm{NADP}^{+}\right],(\mathrm{NADH}$ and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ are the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD], and NADPH and NADP ${ }^{+}$

## BOX 51-3 Sulfonylureas

An entire class of drugs-the sulfonylurea agents-is used in the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes, or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Type 2 diabetes arises from two defects: (1) $\beta$ cells are still capable of making insulin but do not respond adequately to increased blood [glucose], and (2) insulin target tissues are less sensitive or "resistant" to insulin.

The sulfonylurea agents were discovered accidentally. During the development of sulfonamide antibiotics after the Second World War, investigators noticed that the chemically related sulfonylurea agents produced hypoglycemia in laboratory animals. These drugs turned out to have no value as antibiotics, but they did prove effective in treating the hyperglycemia of type 2 diabetes. The sulfonylureas enhance insulin secretion by binding to the SUR subunits (see p. 199) of $\mathrm{K}_{\text {ATP }}$ channels, thereby decreasing the likelihood that these channels will be open. This action enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (see Fig. 51-4). By increasing insulin secretion, sulfonylureas overcome insulin resistance and decrease blood glucose in these patients.

Unlike insulin, which must be injected, sulfonylureas can be taken orally and are therefore preferred by many patients. However, they have a therapeutic role only in type 2 diabetes; the $\beta$ cells in patients with type 1 diabetes are nearly all destroyed, and these patients must be treated with insulin replacement therapy.

Figure 51-4 Mechanism of insulin secretion by the pancreatic $\beta$ cell. Increased levels of extracellular glucose trigger the $\beta$ cell to secrete insulin in the seven steps outlined in this figure. Metabolizable sugars (e.g., galactose and mannose) and certain amino acids (e.g., arginine and leucine) can also stimulate the fusion of vesicles that contain previously synthesized insulin. In addition to these fuel sources, certain hormones (e.g., glucagon, somatostatin, cholecystokinin (CCK)) can also modulate insulin secretion.

Step 3: The increase in the ratio [ATP]/[ADP] ${ }_{n}$ or $[\mathrm{NADH}]_{i} /$ $\left[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right]_{n}$ or $\left[\mathrm{NADPH}\right]_{i} /\left[\mathrm{NADP}^{+}\right]_{i}$ causes $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{ATP}}$ channels (see p. 198) to close.
Step 4: Reducing the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance of the cell membrane causes the $\beta$ cell to depolarize (i.e., the membrane potential is less negative).
Step 5: This depolarization activates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see pp. 190-191).
Step 6: The increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability leads to increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx and increased intracellular free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. This rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ additionally triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release (see pp. 242-243).
Step 7: The increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{n}$ perhaps by activation of a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ calmodulin phosphorylation cascade, ultimately leads to insulin release.

Other secretagogues can also modulate insulin secretion via the phospholipase C pathway (see p. 58) or via the adenylyl cyclase pathway (see p. 53) in addition to the pathway just outlined. For example, glucagon, which stimulates insulin release, may bypass part or all of the glucose/ $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ pathway by stimulating adenylyl cyclase, thus raising cAMP levels and activating protein kinase A (PKA). Conversely, somatostatin, which inhibits insulin release, may act by inhibiting adenylyl cyclase.

## Neural and humoral factors modulate insulin secretion

The islet is richly innervated by both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. Neural signals appear to play an important role in the $\beta$-cell response in several settings. $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-adrenergic stimulation augments islet insulin secretion, whereas $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-adrenergic stimulation inhibits it (see Fig. 51-4). Isoproterenol, a synthetic catecholamine that is a specific agonist for the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor, potently stimulates insulin release. In contrast, norepinephrine and synthetic $\alpha$-adrenergic agonists suppress insulin release both basally and in response to hyperglycemia. Because the postsynaptic sympathetic neurons of the pancreas release norepinephrine, which stimulates $\alpha$ more than $\beta$ adrenoceptors, sympathetic stimulation via the celiac nerves inhibits insulin secretion. In contrast to $\alpha$-adrenergic stimulation, parasympathetic stimulation via the vagus nerve, which releases acetylcholine, causes an increase in insulin release.

Exercise The effect of sympathetic regulation on insulin secretion may be particularly important during exercise, when adrenergic stimulation of the islet increases. The major role for $\alpha$-adrenergic inhibition of insulin secretion during exercise is to prevent hypoglycemia. Exercising muscle tissue uses glucose even when plasma [insulin] is low. If insulin levels were to rise, glucose use by the muscle would increase even further and promote hypoglycemia. Furthermore, an increase in [insulin] would inhibit lipolysis and fatty-acid release from adipocytes and would thus diminish the availability of fatty acids, which the muscle can use as an alternative fuel to glucose (see p. 1211). Finally, a rise in [insulin] would decrease glucose production by the liver. Suppression of insulin secretion during exercise may thus serve to prevent excessive glucose uptake by muscle, which, if it were to exceed the ability of the liver to produce glucose, would lead to severe hypoglycemia, compromise the brain, and abruptly end any exercise!

Feeding Another important setting in which neural and humoral factors regulate insulin secretion is during feeding. Food ingestion triggers a complex series of neural, endocrine, and nutritional signals to many body tissues. The cephalic phase (see pp. 871 and 890) of eating, which occurs before food is ingested, results in stimulation of gastric acid secretion and a small rise in plasma insulin level. This response appears to be mediated by the vagus nerve in both cases. If no food is forthcoming, blood [glucose] declines slightly and insulin secretion is again suppressed. If food ingestion does occur, the acetylcholine released by postganglionic vagal fibers in the islet augments the insulin response of the $\beta$ cell to glucose.

As already discussed, after a subject drinks a glucose solution, the total amount of insulin secreted is greater than when the same amount of glucose is administered intravenously (see Fig. 51-3A). This observation has led to a search for enteric factors or incretins that augment the islet $\beta$-cell response to an oral glucose stimulus. Currently, we know of three peptides released by intestinal cells in response to feeding that enhance insulin secretion: cholecystokinin from I cells, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) from L cells, and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP, also called glucosedependent insulinotropic peptide) from K cells. GLP-1 (see p. 1051), perhaps the most important incretin yet discovered, has a very short half-life in plasma ( $<2 \mathrm{~min}$ ), which precludes its therapeutic use. A peptide analog of GLP-1, called exendin-4, is found in the saliva of the Gila monster. A longlasting synthetic derivative of exendin-4 (exenatide) is approved for use in treating diabetic patients to enhance insulin secretion and to ameliorate hyperglycemia. Because it is a peptide, exenatide cannot be given orally but is effective by subcutaneous injection. Orally available agents have been developed that inhibit the enzyme dipeptidyl-peptidase 4 , which breaks down native GLP-1; these gliptins are now available to treat type 2 diabetes.

In the laboratory, incretins stimulate insulin secretion by isolated islets of Langerhans, and glucose increases this secretion even further. The presence of these incretins in the gut mucosa gives the islets advance notice that nutrients are being absorbed and "primes" the $\beta$ cells to amplify their response to glucose. In addition, vagal stimulation of the $\beta$ cells primes the islets for an amplified response.

## The insulin receptor is a receptor tyrosine kinase

Once insulin is secreted into the portal blood, it first travels to the liver, where more than half is bound and removed from the circulation. The insulin that escapes the liver is available to stimulate insulin-sensitive processes in other tissues. At each target tissue, the first action of insulin is to bind to a specific receptor tyrosine kinase (see pp. 68-70) on the plasma membrane (Fig. 51-5).

The insulin receptor-as well as the closely related insulinlike growth factor 1 (IGF-1) receptor-is a heterotetramer,

# N51-5 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (or Hexose Monophosphate Shunt) 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 58-1 mentions that glucose-6-phosphate can have three major fates. The anabolic series of reactions summarized in this figure convert glucose-6-phosphate to glycogen. The glycolytic pathway summarized in Figure 58-6A is a catabolic pathway that converts glucose-6-phosphate to pyruvate. The third fate-the pentose phosphate pathway-is another catabolic series of reactions that converts glucose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate.

The pentose phosphate pathway has two major products, NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. The cell can use the reducing equivalents in NADPH (i.e., energy "currency") to reduce double bonds in the energy-consuming synthesis of fatty acids and steroids. These reactions are particularly important in such tissues as liver, adipose tissue, mammary gland, and adrenal cortex. Note that the cell cannot use NADH to create NADPH. Thus, the pentose phosphate pathway is critical. The second product of the pathway, ribose-5-phosphate, is important for the synthesis of ribonucleotides, which is particularly important in growing and regenerating tissues. The pentose phosphate pathway involves four reactions, the first and third of which involve the conversion of $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$to NADPH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

If the cell does not use the ribose-5-phosphate to generate ribonucleotides, the cell can use a complex series of reactions to convert the ribose-5-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This sequence of reactions (i.e., from glucose-6-phosphate to ribose-5-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) bypasses or "shunts" the
conversion of glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate, which would otherwise be catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (see Fig. 58-6A). For this reason, the pentose phosphate pathway is also called the hexose monophosphate shunt.* However, the reader should be reassured that the shunt does not permit the cell to generate two NADPH molecules for free. Three glucose-6-phosphate molecules $(3 \times 6=18$ carbons) must traverse the hexose monophosphate shunt to generate six NADPH molecules $(3 \times 2=6)$ plus two fructose-6-phosphate $(2 \times 6=12$ carbons) molecules, a single glyceraldehyde-3phosphate $(1 \times 3=3$ carbons), and three $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules that arise from a decarboxylation reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway $(3 \times 1=3$ carbons). If those three glucose molecules had gone through the classical glycolytic pathway, they would have generated $3 \times 2=6$ net ATPs and 6 NADHs (see Table 58-3). However, if those same three glucose molecules all go through the pentose phosphate pathway, the net result is only five ATPs, only five NADHs, but six NADPHs. Thus, the cell gives up only one ATP and one NADH for the sake of generating six NADPHs-not a bad deal for the cell!

Figure 51-5 Insulin receptor. The insulin receptor is a heterotetramer that consists of two extracellular $\alpha$ chains and two membrane-spanning $\beta$ chains. Insulin binding takes place on the cysteine-rich region of the $\alpha$ chains.
with two identical $\alpha$ chains and two identical $\beta$ chains. (5) NS1-6 The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains are synthesized as a single polypeptide that is subsequently cleaved. The two chains are joined by disulfide linkage (reminiscent of the synthesis of the A and B chains of insulin itself) in the sequence $\beta-\alpha-\alpha-\beta$. The insulin receptor shares considerable structural similarity with the IGF-1 receptor (see p. 996). The overall sequence homology is $\sim 50 \%$, and this figure rises to $>80 \%$ in the tyrosine kinase region. This similarity is sufficient that very high concentrations of insulin can stimulate the IGF-1 receptor and, conversely, high levels of IGF-1 can stimulate the insulin receptor.

The insulin receptor's extracellular $\alpha$ chains have multiple N -glycosylation sites. The $\beta$ chains have an extracellular, a membrane-spanning, and an intracellular portion. The $\beta$ subunit of the receptor is glycosylated on its extracellular domains; receptor glycosylation is required for insulin binding and action. The intracellular domain of the $\beta$ chain possesses tyrosine kinase activity, which increases markedly when insulin binds to sites on the $\alpha$ chains of the receptor. The insulin receptor can phosphorylate both itself and other intracellular substrates at tyrosine residues (see pp. 68-70). The targets of tyrosine phosphorylation (beyond the receptor itself) include a family of cytosolic proteins known as insulin-receptor substrates (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, and IRS4) as well as Src homology C terminus (SHC), as illustrated in Figure 51-6. This phosphorylation mechanism appears to be the major one by which insulin transmits its signal across the plasma membrane of insulin target tissues.

The IRS proteins are docking proteins to which various downstream effector proteins bind and thus become activated. IRS-1 has at least eight tyrosines within specific motifs that generally bind proteins containing SH2 (Src homology domain 2) domains (see p. 58), so that a single IRS molecule

## BOX 51-4 The Insulin Receptor and Rare Forms of Diabetes

The ability of insulin to act on a target cell depends on three things: the number of receptors present on the target cell, the receptor's affinity for insulin, and the receptor's ability to transduce the insulin signal.

Several disorders have been described in which a mutation of the insulin receptor blunts or prevents insulin's actions. One such mutation markedly affects growth in utero, as well as after birth. This rare disorder is called leprechaunism, and it is generally lethal within the first year of life. Other mutations of the receptor have less devastating consequences.

Some individuals make antibodies to their own insulin receptors. Insulin, produced either endogenously or administered to these patients, does not work well because it must compete with these antibodies for sites on the receptor; as a result, the patient is hyperglycemic. Interestingly, other antibodies can be "insulin mimetic"; that is, not only do the antibodies bind to the receptor, but they also actually mimic insulin's action. This mimicry causes severe hypoglycemia in affected individuals.

Neither receptor mutations nor antireceptor antibodies appear to be responsible for any of the common forms of diabetes seen clinically. However, abnormal insulin-receptor signaling may be involved in many patients with type 2 diabetes. Indeed, activation of inflammatory pathways involving the p38 subset of MAPKs (see p. 69) and nuclear factor $\kappa B$ (see pp. 86-87) can lead to phosphorylation of the insulin receptor (and of IRS proteins), principally at serine residues. This serine phosphorylation occurs commonly in animal models of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes as well as in human diabetes, and can interfere with the normal metabolic actions of insulin.
simultaneously activates multiple pathways. The IGF-1 receptor, which is closely related to the insulin receptor, also acts through IRS proteins.

Figure 51-6 illustrates three major signaling pathways triggered by the aforementioned tyrosine phosphorylations. (5) NS1-7 The first begins when phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) binds to phosphorylated IRS and becomes activated. PI3K phosphorylates a membrane lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$ to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{3}\right)$, and it leads to major changes in glucose and protein metabolism.

The second signaling pathway begins in one of two ways: (1) the insulin receptor phosphorylates SHC or (2) growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2; see p. 69) binds to an IRS and becomes activated. As illustrated in Figure 51-6, both phosphorylated SHC and activated GRB2 trigger the Ras signaling pathway, leading through mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK; see pp. 68-69) to increased gene expression and growth. Gene-deletion studies in mice show that IRS-1 deletion does not cause diabetes but results in small mice. In contrast, IRS-2 deletion does cause diabetes, in part because of impaired insulin secretion by the pancreatic $\beta$ cell!

The third signaling pathway begins with the binding of SH2-containing proteins-other than PI3K and GRB2, already discussed-to specific phosphotyrosine groups on either the insulin receptor or IRS proteins. This binding activates the SH2-containing protein (Box 51-4).

## N51-6 Insulin and IGF-1 Receptors

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Activation of the insulin and IGF-1 receptors (see Fig. 51-5) occurs by somewhat different mechanisms, as we discuss on pages 1041-1042 for the insulin receptor and on page 996 for IGF-1 receptor. In brief, these receptors are tetrameric; they are composed of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits. The $\alpha$ subunit contains a cysteine-rich region and functions in ligand binding. The $\beta$ subunit is a single-pass transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits are held together by disulfide bonds (as are the two $\alpha$ subunits), forming a heterotetramer. Ligand binding produces conformational changes that appear to cause allosteric interactions between the two $\alpha$ and $\beta$ pairs, as opposed to the dimerization characteristic of the first class of receptor tyrosine kinases (see Fig. 3-12C). Thus, insulin binding results in the autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the catalytic domains of the $\beta$ subunits. The activated insulin receptor also phosphorylates cytoplasmic substrates such as IRS-1 (see Fig. 51-6), which, once phosphorylated, serves as a docking site for additional signaling proteins.

## N51-7 Insulin Signal Transduction

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Figure 51-6 shows three major pathways. In the first pathway, activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$ to form phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate ( $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$, see p. 58), which in turn activates phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase (PDK). This serine/threonine kinase then activates protein kinase B (PKB), which leads to the insertion of GLUT4 glucose transporters into the plasma membrane. PDK also phosphorylates and thus inactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3); the net effect is reduced inactivation of glycogen synthase (GS) and enhanced glycogen synthesis. Finally PDK activates mTOR (target of rapamycin), a serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates the binding protein PHAS-1 and thus releases an active initiation factor (IF), promoting translation of mRNA into protein. mTOR also phosphorylates p70-S6 kinase, which phosphorylates the ribosomal S6 protein.

In the second pathway, the insulin receptor phosphorylates SHC (which stands for Src homology, C terminus) at tyrosine residues, stimulating SOS. In addition, activation of GRB2 also stimulates SOS. The stimulated SOS activates the Ras pathway, as described in Figure 3-13. The activated Raf-1, which is itself a MEK kinase, activates not only MEK but also other MEK kinases, which in turn activate JNK (a kinase) and p38 kinase. MAPK activates both a transcription factor and p90-S6 kinase. The activated p90-S6 kinase phosphorylates a variety of nuclear proteins as well as phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1); the latter leads to activation of glycogen synthase.

In the third pathway, SH2-containing proteins (shown in blue in Fig. 51-6)-other than PI3K and GRB2, already discussed—bind to specific phosphotyrosine groups on either the insulin receptor or IRS proteins. These SH2-containing proteins have a variety of effects, for example, on enzymes involved in lipid metabolism.

Figure 51-6 Insulin signal-transduction system. When insulin binds to its receptor-which is a receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)-tyrosine kinase domains on the intracellular portion of the $\beta$ chains become active. The activated receptor transduces its signals to downstream effectors by phosphorylating at tyrosine residues on the receptor itself, the IRS family (IRS-1, IRS-2, IRS-3, IRS-4), and other cytosolic proteins (e.g., SHC). SH2-containing proteins dock onto certain phosphorylated tyrosine groups on the IRSs and thus become activated. Not all of the signaling pathways are active in all of insulin's target cells. For example, the liver cell does not rely on the GLUT4 transporter to move glucose in and out of the cell. Likewise, the liver is a very important target for regulation of the gluconeogenic enzymes by insulin, whereas muscle and adipose tissue are not. GS, glycogen synthase; GSK-3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; IF, initiation factor; PDK, phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase.

Figure 51-7 Response to insulin of normal and downregulated adipocytes.

## High levels of insulin lead to downregulation of insulin receptors

The number of insulin receptors expressed on the cell surface is far greater than that needed for the maximal biological response to insulin. For example, in the adipocyte, the glucose response to insulin is maximal when only $\sim 5 \%$ of the receptors are occupied; that is, the target cells have many "spare" receptors for insulin.

The number of insulin receptors present on the membrane of a target cell is determined by the balance among three factors: (1) receptor synthesis, (2) endocytosis of receptors followed by recycling of receptors back to the cell surface, and (3) endocytosis followed by degradation of receptors. Cells chronically exposed to high concentrations of insulin have fewer surface receptors than do those exposed to lower concentrations. This dynamic ability of cells to decrease the number of specific receptors on their surface is called downregulation. Insulin downregulates insulin receptors by decreasing receptor synthesis and increasing degradation. Such downregulation is one mechanism by which target tissues modulate their response to hormones. Downregulation of insulin receptors results in a decrease in the sensitivity of the target tissue to insulin without diminishing insulin's maximal effect.

One example of how downregulation can affect insulin's action is shown in Figure 51-7, which illustrates the effect of increases in insulin concentration on glucose uptake in adipocytes from normal individuals and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Adipocytes from patients with type 2 diabetes (Box 51-5) have fewer insulin receptors per unit of surface area than do adipocytes from normal individuals. The markedly lower glucose transport across the entire physiological range of insulin concentrations in diabetic adipocytes is characteristic of insulin resistance. In healthy control adipocytes, glucose transport is maximal when only a few ( 5\%) of the receptors are occupied. In diabetic adipocytes, a much higher concentration of insulin is required, and a larger fraction of the insulin receptors is occupied. However, the major effects in type 2 diabetes apparently are not the result of
a decrease in receptor number, but rather are caused by impairment in signaling downstream from the receptor. This impairment includes diminished activity of the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase, PI3K activity, and perhaps other steps along the pathway to GLUT4 recruitment to the plasma membrane (see Fig. 51-6). It is the summation of these multiple defects, only some of which have been identified, that leads to insulin resistance.

## In liver, insulin promotes conversion of glucose to glycogen stores or to triacylglycerols

Insulin's actions on cellular targets frequently involve numerous tissue-specific enzymatic and structural processes. As we will see in this and the next two sections, the three principal targets for insulin action are liver, muscle, and adipose tissue.

Because the pancreatic veins drain into the portal venous system, all hormones secreted by the pancreas must traverse the liver before entering the systemic circulation. For insulin, the liver is both a target tissue for hormone action and a major site of degradation.

The concentration of insulin in portal venous blood before extraction by the liver is three to four times greater than its concentration in the systemic circulation. The hepatocyte is therefore bathed in a relatively high concentration of insulin and is thus well positioned to respond acutely to changes in plasma [insulin].

After feeding, the plasma [insulin] rises, triggered by glucose and by neural and incretin stimulation of $\beta$ cells. In the liver, this insulin rise acts on four main processes involved in fuel metabolism. These divergent effects of insulin entail the use of multiple enzymatic control mechanisms, indicated by numbered boxes in Figure 51-8.

Glycogen Synthesis and Glycogenolysis Physiological increases in plasma [insulin] decrease the breakdown and utilization of glycogen and-conversely-promote the formation of glycogen from plasma glucose. Although moderately increased levels of insulin allow gluconeogenesis to persist, the hepatocytes store the gluconeogenic product-glucose-6-phosphate-as glycogen rather than releasing it as glucose into the bloodstream. At high concentrations, insulin can inhibit the gluconeogenic conversion of lactate/pyruvate and amino acids to glucose-6-phosphate.

Glucose enters the hepatocyte from the blood via GLUT2, which mediates the facilitated diffusion of glucose. GLUT2 is present in abundance in the liver plasma membrane, even in the absence of insulin, and its activity is not influenced by insulin. Insulin stimulates glycogen synthesis from glucose by activating glucokinase (numbered box 1 in Fig. 51-8) and glycogen synthase (box 2). The latter enzyme contains multiple serine phosphorylation sites. Insulin causes a net dephosphorylation of the protein, thus increasing the enzyme's activity. At the same time that glycogen synthase is being activated, increases in both insulin and glucose diminish the activity of glycogen phosphorylase (box 3). This enzyme is rate limiting for the breakdown of glycogen. The same enzyme that dephosphorylates (and thus activates) glycogen synthase also dephosphorylates (and thus inhibits) phosphorylase. Thus, insulin has opposite effects

# BOX 51-5 Diabetes Mellitus 

Diabetes is the most common serious metabolic disease in humans. The hallmark of diabetes is an elevated blood glucose concentration, but this abnormality is just one of many biochemical and physiological alterations. Diabetes is not one disorder, but can arise as a result of numerous defects in regulation of the synthesis, secretion, and action of insulin. The type of diabetes that most commonly affects children is called type 1 IDDM. The diabetes that generally begins in adulthood and is particularly common in obese individuals is called type 2 or NIDDM.

## Type 1 Diabetes

## 5 N51-4

Type 1 diabetes is caused by an immune-mediated selective destruction of the $\beta$ cells of the pancreas. The other cell types present in the islet are spared. The consequence of the loss of insulin, with the preservation of glucagon, can be viewed as an accelerated form of fasting or starvation. A healthy person who is fasting for several days continues to secrete insulin at a low rate that is sufficient to balance the action of glucagon in modulating the production of glucose and ketones by the liver. However, in type 1 diabetes, insulin deficiency is severe, and glucose and ketone production by the liver occur at a rate that greatly exceeds the rate at which they are being used. As a result, the concentration of these substances in blood begins to rise. Even when glucose concentrations reach levels 5 to 10 times normal, no insulin is secreted because $\beta$ cells are absent. The increased glucose and ketones provide an immense solute load to the kidney that causes osmotic diuresis. In addition, the keto acids that are produced are moderately strong organic acids ( $\mathrm{p} K<4.0$ ), and their increased production causes severe metabolic acidosis (see p. 635). If these patients are not treated with insulin, the acidosis and dehydration lead to death from diabetic ketoacidosis.

With appropriate diagnosis and the availability of insulin as an effective treatment, persons with type 1 diabetes can lead full, productive lives. Indeed, some patients have been taking insulin successfully for treatment of type 1 diabetes for $>75$ years. As technology has improved, patients have been able to monitor their blood glucose levels themselves and adjust their insulin dosages accordingly, using specifically designed insulin analogs that have either short or very long half-lives, or insulin pumps that
continuously deliver insulin via a subcutaneous catheter. Thus, individuals with type 1 diabetes can avoid not only severe, lifethreatening episodes of ketoacidosis but also the long-term consequences of diabetes-namely, blood vessel injury that can lead to blindness, kidney failure, and accelerated atherosclerosis.

## Type 2 Diabetes

In type 2 diabetes, the cause of hyperglycemia is more complex. These individuals continue to make insulin. $\beta$ cells not only are present but also are frequently hyperplastic (at least early in the course of the disease). For reasons still being defined, the $\beta$ cells do not respond normally to increases in plasma glucose level by increasing insulin secretion. However, altered insulin secretion is only part of the problem. If we administered identical doses of insulin to the liver, muscle, and adipose tissue of a person with type 2 diabetes and a healthy control, we would find that the patient with type 2 diabetes is resistant to the action of insulin. Thus, both the secretion of insulin and the metabolism of glucose in response to insulin are abnormal in type 2 diabetes. Which problem-decreased insulin release or insulin resistance-is more important in provoking development of the diabetic state likely varies among individuals. Usually, these patients make enough insulin-and it is sufficiently active-that the severe ketoacidosis described above in patients with type 1 diabetes does not develop.

The insulin resistance seen in individuals with type 2 diabetes appears to bring with it an increase in the prevalence of hypertension, obesity, and a specific dyslipidemia characterized by elevated TAGs and depressed high-density lipoproteins (see Fig. 46-15). Insulin resistance (along with one or more of these other metabolic abnormalities) is frequently found in individuals before the development of type 2 diabetes and is referred to as metabolic syndrome. This constellation of abnormalities is estimated to affect $>45$ million individuals in the United States alone. Because each component of this syndrome has adverse effects on blood vessels, these individuals are at particularly increased risk of early atherosclerosis.

Tight control of glucose concentrations in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, together with careful management of blood pressure and plasma lipids, can retard the development of many of the long-term complications of diabetes.
on the opposing enzymes, with the net effect that it promotes glycogen formation. Insulin also inhibits glucose-6phosphatase (G6Pase; box 4), which otherwise converts glucose-6-phosphate (derived either from glycogenolysis or gluconeogenesis) to glucose. Glycogen is an important storage form of carbohydrate in both liver and muscle. The glycogen stored during the postprandial period is then available for use many hours later as a source of glucose.

Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis Insulin promotes the conversion of some of the glucose taken up by the liver into pyruvate and-conversely-diminishes the use of pyruvate and other three-carbon compounds for gluconeogenesis. Insulin induces transcription of the glucokinase gene (numbered box 1 in Fig. 51-8) and thus results in increased synthesis of this enzyme, which is responsible for phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and initiating the metabolism of glucose. In acting to promote glycolysis and
diminish gluconeogenesis, insulin induces the synthesis of a glucose metabolite, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate. This compound is a potent allosteric activator of phosphofructokinase (box 5), a key regulatory enzyme in glycolysis. Insulin also stimulates pyruvate kinase (box 6), which forms pyruvate, and stimulates pyruvate dehydrogenase (box 8), which catalyzes the first step in pyruvate oxidation. Finally, insulin promotes glucose metabolism by the hexose monophosphate shunt (box 7). 5 N51-5

In addition, insulin also inhibits gluconeogenesis at several steps. Insulin diminishes transcription of the gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK; numbered box 9 in Fig. 51-8), thus reducing the synthesis of a key regulatory enzyme required to form phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate early in the gluconeogenic pathway. The increased levels of fructose-2,6-bisphosphate also inhibit the activity of fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (box 10), which is also part of the gluconeogenic pathway.

![bo526000512f](bo526000512f.jpg)

Figure 51-8 Effect of insulin on hepatocytes. Insulin has four major effects on liver cells. First, insulin promotes glycogen synthesis from glucose by enhancing the transcription of glucokinase (1) and by activating glycogen synthase (2). Additionally, insulin together with glucose inhibits glycogen breakdown to glucose by diminishing the activity of G6Pase (4). Glucose also inhibits glycogen phosphorylase (3). Second, insulin promotes glycolysis and carbohydrate oxidation by increasing the activity of glucokinase (1), phosphofructokinase (5), and pyruvate kinase (6). Insulin also promotes glucose metabolism via the hexose monophosphate shunt (7). Finally, insulin promotes the oxidation of pyruvate by stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (8). Insulin also inhibits gluconeogenesis by inhibiting the activity of PEPCK (9), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (10), and G6Pase (4). Third, insulin promotes the synthesis and storage of fats by increasing the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (11) and fatty-acid synthase (12) as well as the synthesis of several apoproteins packaged with VLDL. Insulin also indirectly inhibits fat oxidation because the increased levels of malonyl CoA inhibit CAT I (13). The inhibition of fat oxidation helps shunt fatty acids to esterification as TAGs and storage as VLDL or lipid droplets. Fourth, by mechanisms that are not well understood, insulin promotes protein synthesis (14) and inhibits protein breakdown (15).

Lipogenesis Insulin promotes the storage of fats and inhibits the oxidation of fatty acids (see Fig. 58-10) through allosteric and covalent modification of key regulatory enzymes, as well as by transcription of new enzymes (numbered boxes in Fig. 51-8). The pyruvate that is now available from glycolysis can be used to synthesize fatty acids. Insulin promotes dephosphorylation of acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase 2 (ACC2; box 11), the first committed step in fatty-acid synthesis in the liver. This dephosphorylation leads to increased synthesis of malonyl CoA, which allosterically inhibits carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I; box 13). This enzyme converts acyl CoA and carnitine to acylcarnitine, a reaction necessary for long-chain fatty acids to cross the inner mitochondrial membrane, where they can be oxidized. Thus, malonyl CoA inhibits fatty-acid transport and fat oxidation. At the same time, insulin stimulates fatty-acid synthase (box 12), which generates fatty acids. Thus, because insulin promotes the formation of malonyl CoA and fatty acids but inhibits fatty-acid oxidation, this hormone favors esterification of the fatty acids with glycerol within the liver to form triacylglycerols (TAGs). The liver can either store these TAGs in lipid droplets or export them as very-lowdensity lipoprotein (VLDL) particles (see p. 968). Insulin also induces the synthesis of several of the apoproteins that are packaged with the VLDL particle. The hepatocyte then releases these VLDLs, which leave the liver via the hepatic vein. Muscle and adipose tissue subsequently take up the lipids in these VLDL particles and either store them or oxidize them for fuel. Thus, by regulation of transcription, by allosteric activation, and by regulation of protein phosphorylation, insulin acts to promote the synthesis and storage of fat and diminish its oxidation in liver. NS1-8

Protein Metabolism Insulin stimulates the synthesis of protein and simultaneously reduces the degradation of protein within the liver (numbered boxes in Fig. 51-8). The general mechanisms by which insulin stimulates protein synthesis (box 14) and restrains proteolysis (box 15) by the liver are complex and are less well understood than the mechanisms regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism.

In summary, insulin modulates the activity of multiple regulatory enzymes, which are responsible for the hepatic metabolism of carbohydrates, fat, and protein. Insulin causes the liver to take up glucose from the blood and either store the glucose as glycogen or break it down into pyruvate. The pyruvate provides the building blocks for storage of the glucose carbon atoms as fat. Insulin also diminishes the oxidation of fat, which normally supplies much of the ATP used by the liver. As a result, insulin causes the liver, as well as other body tissues, to burn carbohydrates preferentially.

## In muscle, insulin promotes the uptake of glucose and its storage as glycogen

Muscle is a major insulin-sensitive tissue and the principal site of insulin-mediated glucose disposal. Insulin has four major effects on muscle.

First, in muscle, unlike in the liver, glucose crosses the plasma membrane principally via GLUT4, an insulinsensitive glucose transporter. GLUT4, which is found virtually exclusively in striated muscle and adipose tissue, belongs
to a family of proteins that mediate the facilitated diffusion of glucose (see p. 114). Insulin markedly stimulates GLUT4 in both muscle (Fig. 51-9) and fat (see below) by a process involving recruitment of preformed transporters from a membranous compartment in the cell cytosol out to the plasma membrane. Recruitment places additional glucose transporters in the plasma membrane, thereby increasing the $V_{\max }$ of glucose transport into muscle and increasing the flow of glucose from the interstitial fluid to the cytosol. As discussed above, a different glucose transporter, GLUT2, mediates glucose transport into hepatocytes (see Fig. 51-8) and $\beta$ cells, and insulin does not increase the activity of that transporter.

The enzymatic steps regulated by insulin are indicated by numbered boxes in Figure 51-9.

The second effect of insulin on muscle is to enhance the conversion of glucose to glycogen by activating hexokinase (numbered box 1 in Fig. 51-9)-different from the glucokinase in liver-and glycogen synthase (box 2).

Third, insulin increases glycolysis and oxidation by increasing the activity of phosphofructokinase (box 3) and pyruvate dehydrogenase (box 4).

Fourth, insulin also stimulates the synthesis of protein in skeletal muscle (box 5) and slows the degradation of existing proteins (box 6). The result is preservation of muscle protein mass, which has obvious beneficial effects in preserving strength and locomotion. The insulin-induced increase in glucose utilization permits the muscle to diminish fat utilization and allows it to store as TAGs some of the fatty acid that it removes from the circulation. The stored TAGs and glycogen are a major sources of energy that muscle can use later when called on to exercise or generate heat.

Exercise and insulin have some interesting parallel effects on skeletal muscle. Both increase the recruitment of GLUT4 transporters to the sarcolemma and both increase glucose oxidation; therefore, both increase glucose uptake by muscle. Additionally, exercise and insulin appear to have synergistic effects on the above processes. Clinically, this synergism is manifest as a marked increase in insulin sensitivity induced by exercise and is exploited as part of the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus.

In muscle, as in the liver, insulin directs the overall pattern of cellular fuel metabolism by acting at multiple sites. In both tissues, insulin increases the oxidation of carbohydrate, thus preserving body protein and fat stores. Carbohydrate ingested in excess of that used immediately as an oxidative fuel is either stored as glycogen in liver and muscle or is converted to lipid in the liver and exported to adipose tissue and muscle.

## In adipocytes, insulin promotes glucose uptake and conversion to TAGs for storage

Adipose tissue is the third major insulin-sensitive tissue involved in the regulation of body fuel. Again, insulin has several sites of action in adipocytes. All begin with the same receptor-mediated action of insulin to stimulate several cellular effector pathways. Insulin has four major actions on adipocytes.

First, like muscle, adipose tissue contains the insulinsensitive GLUT4 glucose transporter. In insulin-stimulated

# N51-8 Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease 

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

There are differences in the hepatic metabolism of glucose and fructose of importance to human health. Hepatic glucose metabolism is tightly regulated by phosphofructokinase, which is inhibited by ATP and citrate. Thus, when energy status is sufficient, hepatic uptake of dietary glucose is inhibited and much of the consumed glucose will bypass the liver and reach the systemic circulation. In contrast, dietary fructose is metabolized to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase, which is not regulated by hepatic energy status and the inhibitory effects of high ATP and citrate levels. Thus, fructose uptake and metabolism by the liver is unregulated, and relatively little of ingested fructose reaches the systemic circulation. In the liver, the large fructose load can result in increased de novo lipogenesis and inhibition of fatty-acid oxidation. This process contributes to the development of hepatic insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Owing to the current epidemic of obesity, NAFLD is now the most common liver disorder in adults and children.

Figure 51-9 Effect of insulin on muscle. Insulin has four major effects on muscle cells. First, insulin promotes glucose uptake by recruiting GLUT4 transporters to the plasma membrane. Second, insulin promotes glycogen synthesis from glucose by enhancing the transcription of hexokinase (1) and by activating glycogen synthase (2). Third, insulin promotes glycolysis and carbohydrate oxidation by increasing the activity of hexokinase (1), phosphofructokinase (3), and pyruvate dehydrogenase (4). These actions are similar to those in liver; note that there is little or no gluconeogenesis in muscle. Fourth, insulin promotes protein synthesis (5) and inhibits protein breakdown (6).
cells, preformed transporters are recruited from an intracellular compartment to the cell membrane, which markedly accelerates the entry of glucose into the cell.

Second, insulin promotes the breakdown of glucose to metabolites that will eventually be used to synthesize TAGs. Unlike in muscle or liver, little of the glucose taken up is stored as glycogen. Instead, the adipocyte glycolytically
metabolizes much of the glucose to $\alpha$-glycerol phosphate, which it uses to esterify long-chain fatty acids into TAGs. The glucose not used for esterification goes on to form acetyl CoA and then malonyl CoA and fatty acids. Insulin enhances this flow of glucose to fatty acids by stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (numbered box 1 in Fig. 51-10) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (box 2).

![bo546000512f](bo546000512f.jpg)

Figure 51-10 Effect of insulin on adipocytes. Insulin has four major effects on adipocytes. First, insulin promotes glucose uptake by recruiting GLUT4 transporters to the plasma membrane. Second, insulin promotes glycolysis, which leads to the formation of $\alpha$-glycerol phosphate. Insulin also promotes the conversion of pyruvate to fatty acids by stimulating pyruvate dehydrogenase (1) and acetyl CoA carboxylase (2). Third, insulin promotes the esterification of $\alpha$-glycerol phosphate with fatty acids to form TAGs, which the adipocyte stores in fat droplets. Conversely, insulin inhibits HSL (3), which would otherwise break the TAGs down into glycerol and fatty acids. Fourth, insulin promotes the synthesis of LPL in the adipocyte. The adipocyte then exports this enzyme to the endothelial cell, where it breaks down the TAGs contained in chylomicrons and VLDL, yielding fatty acids. These fatty acids then enter the adipocyte for esterification and storage in fat droplets as TAGs.

![bo556000512f](bo556000512f.jpg)

Figure 51-11 Synthesis of the glucagon molecule. The proglucagon molecule includes amino-acid sequences that, depending on how the peptide chain is cleaved, can yield glucagon-related polypeptide (GRPP), glucagon, intervening peptide 1 (IP-1), GLP-1, IP-2, and GLP-2. Proteases in the pancreatic $\alpha$ cells cleave proglucagon at points that yield GRPP, glucagon, and a C-terminal fragment. Proteases in neuroendocrine cells in the intestine cleave proglucagon to yield glicentin, GLP-1, IP-2, and GLP-2.

Third, insulin promotes the formation of TAGs by simple mass action; the increased levels of $\alpha$-glycerol phosphate increase its esterification with fatty acids (principally C-16 and C-18) to yield TAGs. Some of the fatty acids are a result of the glucose metabolism noted above. Most of the fatty acids, however, enter the adipocyte from chylomicrons and VLDLs (see Table 46-4) in the blood. The cell sequesters these TAGs in lipid droplets, which form most of the mass of the adipose cell. Conversely, insulin restrains the activity of adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL; see p. 1182), which converts TAGs to diacylglycerols (DAGs), and hormonesensitive lipase (HSL), which converts DAGs to monoacylglycerols (MAGs). In fat, these enzymes (numbered box 3 in Fig. 51-10) mediate the conversion of stored TAGs to fatty acids and glycerol for export to other tissues.

Fourth, insulin induces the synthesis of a different enzyme-lipoprotein lipase (LPL). This lipase does not act on the lipid stored within the adipose cell. Rather, the adipocyte exports the LPL to the endothelial cell, where it resides on the extracellular surface of the endothelial cell, facing the blood and anchored to the plasma membrane. In this location, the LPL acts on TAGs in chylomicrons and VLDLs and cleaves them into glycerol and fatty acids. These fatty acids are then available for uptake by nearby adipocytes, which esterify them with glycerol phosphate to form TAGs. This mechanism provides an efficient means by which insulin can promote the storage of lipid in adipose tissue.

## GLUCAGON

Glucagon is the other major pancreatic islet hormone that is involved in the regulation of body fuel metabolism. Ingestion of protein appears to be the major physiological stimulus for secretion of glucagon. Glucagon's principal target tissue is the liver. Like insulin, glucagon is secreted first into the portal blood and is therefore anatomically well positioned to regulate hepatic metabolism.

Although the amino acids released by digestion of a protein meal appear to be the major glucagon secretagogue, glucagon's main actions on the liver appear to involve the regulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism. Glucagon is particularly important in stimulating glycogenolysis,
gluconeogenesis, and ketogenesis. Glucagon does not act solely on the liver but also has glycogenolytic action on cardiac and skeletal muscle, lipolytic action on adipose tissue, and proteolytic actions on several tissues. However, these extrahepatic effects appear to be more prominent at pharmacological concentrations of glucagon. At more physiological concentrations, the liver is the major target tissue.

In many circumstances, glucagon's actions on liver antagonize those of insulin, and the mechanism of glucagon action is understood in considerable detail.

## Pancreatic $\alpha$ cells secrete glucagon in response to ingested protein

Glucagon is a 31-amino-acid peptide (molecular weight, $\sim 3500 \mathrm{Da}$ ) synthesized by $\alpha$ cells in the islets of Langerhans. In humans, the glucagon gene is located on chromosome 2. The initial gene product is the mRNA encoding preproglucagon. As is the case for insulin, a peptidase removes the signal sequence of preproglucagon during translation of the mRNA in the rough endoplasmic reticulum to yield proglucagon. Proteases in the $\alpha$ cells subsequently cleave the proglucagon (molecular weight, $\sim 9000 \mathrm{Da}$ ) into the mature glucagon molecule and several biologically active peptides (Fig. 51-11). Neuroendocrine cells (i.e., L cells) within the gut process the proglucagon differently to yield not glucagon but GLP-1-a potent incretin-and other peptides.

Pancreatic $\alpha$ Cells The mature glucagon molecule is the major secretory product of the $\alpha$ cell. As with insulin, the fully processed glucagon molecule is stored in secretory vesicles within the cell's cytosol. Although amino acids are the major secretagogues, the concentrations of amino acids required to provoke secretion of glucagon in vitro are higher than those generated in vivo. This observation suggests that other neural or humoral factors amplify the response in vivo, in a manner analogous to the effects of incretin on insulin secretion. However, the best studied incretin (GLP-1) inhibits glucagon secretion. Whereas both glucose and several amino acids stimulate insulin secretion by $\beta$ cells, only amino acids stimulate glucagon secretion by $\alpha$ cells; glucose inhibits glucagon secretion. The signaling mechanism by which $\alpha$ cells recognize either amino acids or glucose is not known.

Glucagon, like the incretins, is a potent insulin secretagogue. However, because most of the $\alpha$ cells are located downstream from the $\beta$ cells (recall that the circulation of blood proceeds from the $\beta$ cells and then out past the $\alpha$ cells), it is unlikely that glucagon exerts an important paracrine effect on insulin secretion.

Intestinal L Cells Proteases in neuroendocrine cells in the intestine process proglucagon differently than do $\alpha$ cells (see Fig. 51-11). L cells produce four peptide fragments: glicentin, GLP-1, intervening peptide 2 (IP-2), and GLP-2. Glicentin contains the amino-acid sequence of glucagon but does not bind to glucagon receptors. Both GLP-1 and GLP-2 are glucagon-like in that they cross-react with some antisera directed to glucagon, but GLP-1 and GLP-2 have very weak biological activity as glucagon analogs. However, GLP-1released by the gut into the circulation in response to carbohydrate or protein ingestion-is one of the most potent incretins, stimulating insulin secretion. GLP-2 is not an incretin, and its biological actions are not known.

## Glucagon, acting through cAMP, promotes the synthesis of glucose by the liver

Glucagon is an important regulator of hepatic glucose production and ketogenesis in the liver. As shown in Figure 51-12, glucagon binds to a receptor that activates the heterotrimeric G protein $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$, which stimulates membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53). The cAMP formed by the cyclase in turn activates PKA, which phosphorylates numerous regulatory enzymes and other protein substrates, thus altering glucose and fat metabolism in the liver. Whereas insulin leads to the dephosphorylation of certain key enzymes (i.e., glycogen synthase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, phosphorylase), glucagon leads to their phosphorylation.

A particularly clear example of the opposing actions of insulin and glucagon involves the activation of glycogenolysis (see p. 1182). PKA phosphorylates the enzyme phosphorylase kinase (see Fig. 58-9), thus increasing the activity of phosphorylase kinase and allowing it to increase the phosphorylation of its substrate, glycogen phosphorylase $\boldsymbol{b}$. The addition of a single phosphate residue to phosphorylase $b$ converts it to phosphorylase $a$. Liver phosphorylase $b$ has little activity in breaking the one to four glycosidic linkages of glycogen, but phosphorylase $a$ is very active. In addition to converting phosphorylase $b$ to the active phosphorylase $a$ form, PKA also phosphorylates a peptide called inhibitor 1 (see Fig. 3-7). In its phosphorylated form, inhibitor I decreases the activity of phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which otherwise would dephosphorylate both phosphorylase kinase and phosphorylase a (converting them to their inactive forms). PP1 also activates glycogen synthase. Thus, via inhibitor I, glucagon modulates several of the enzymes involved in hepatic glycogen metabolism to provoke net glycogen breakdown. As a result of similar actions on the pathways of gluconeogenesis and lipid oxidation, glucagon also stimulates these processes. Conversely, glucagon restrains glycogen synthesis, glycolysis, and lipid storage.

Glucagon also enhances gluconeogenesis by genomic effects, acting synergistically with glucocorticoids (see p. 1022). The genomic effects of glucagon occur as PKA
phosphorylates the transcription factor cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; see p. 89), which interacts with the cAMP response elements (CREs; see p. 89), increasing the expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes (e.g., G6Pase and PEPCK). Phosphorylated CREB also increases the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ coactivator- $1 \alpha$ (PGC-1 $\alpha$ ), which also enhances the expression of key gluconeogenic enzymes. Insulin restrains the transcription of these two enzymes in two ways, both via the PI3K/Akt pathway (see Fig. 51-6). First, insulin increases the release of the transcription-factor domain of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1; see pp. 87-88), which antagonizes the transcription of mRNA encoding the two enzymes. Second, insulin increases the phosphorylation of the transcription factor FOXO1, thereby promoting its movement out of the nucleus and subsequent degradation; this action prevents FOXO1 from binding to the promoter regions of G6Pase and PEPCK.

These actions of glucagon can be integrated with our understanding of insulin's action on the liver in certain physiological circumstances. For example, after an overnight fast, when insulin concentrations are low, glucagon stimulates the liver to produce the glucose that is required by the brain and other tissues for their ongoing function. (5) N51-9 With ingestion of a protein meal, absorbed amino acids provoke insulin secretion, which can inhibit hepatic glucose production and promote glucose storage by liver and muscle (see above). If the meal lacked carbohydrate, the secreted insulin could cause hypoglycemia. However, glucagon secreted in response to a protein meal balances insulin's action on the liver and thus maintains glucose production and avoids hypoglycemia.

## Glucagon promotes oxidation of fat in the liver, which can lead to ketogenesis

Glucagon plays a major regulatory role in hepatic lipid metabolism. As we saw in our discussion of insulin (see Fig. 51-8), the liver can esterify fatty acids with glycerol to form TAGs, which it can store or export as VLDL particles. Alternatively, the liver can partially oxidize fatty acids-and form ketone bodies (see p. 1185)—or fully oxidize them to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Whereas fatty-acid esterification and storage occur in the liver cytosol, oxidation and ketogenesis occur within the mitochondria.

Glucagon stimulates fat oxidation indirectly by increasing the activity of CAT I (see pp. 1183-1185), which mediates the transfer of fatty acids across the outer mitochondrial membrane. Glucagon produces this stimulation by inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase, which generates malonyl CoA, the first committed intermediate in the synthesis of fatty acids by the liver. Malonyl CoA is also an inhibitor of the CAT system. By inhibiting acetyl CoA carboxylase, glucagon lowers the concentration of malonyl CoA, releases the inhibition of CAT I, and allows fatty acids to be transferred into the mitochondria. These fatty acids are oxidized to furnish ATP to the liver cell. If the rate of fatty-acid transport into the mitochondria exceeds the need of the liver to phosphorylate ADP, the fatty acids will be only partially oxidized; the result is the accumulation of the keto acids $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetic acid, which are two of the three ketone

# N51-9 Maintaining Plasma Glucose Levels during Starvation 

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

Hepatic gluconeogenesis is critical to maintaining normal plasma glucose levels during starvation. Glucagon and glucocorticoids positively regulate gluconeogenesis through synergistic signaling pathways.

Glucagon promotes the interaction of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; see p. 89) with CREB-binding protein (CBP; see p. 84) and CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2). Both CBP and CRTC2 facilitate the binding of CREB to cAMP response elements (CREs).

The hepatocyte nuclear factors forkhead O box (FOXO) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ (PPAR $\gamma$ ) coactivator $1 \alpha$ (PGC-1 $\alpha$ ) also acts synergistically to increase transcription of gluconeogenic genes.

The response to glucocorticoids is mediated by the glucocorticoid receptor, which binds to glucocorticoid response elements (GREs) in the promoters of gluconeogenic genes.

Sirtuin 1, an NAD-dependent deacetylase, is another energy sensor and modifier of the transcriptional activity of some of these transcription factors. For example, it deacetylates and affects the activity of PGC-1 $\alpha$. In contrast, insulin secreted postprandially represses transcription of gluconeogenic enzymes through activation of the Akt signaling pathway.

![bo566000512f](bo566000512f.jpg)

Figure 51-12 Glucagon signal transduction. Glucagon generally antagonizes the effects of insulin in the liver. Glucagon binds to a $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$-coupled receptor, activating the adenylyl cyclase-cAMP-PKA cascade. Glucagon has three major effects on liver cells. First, glucagon promotes net glycogen breakdown. Glucagon inhibits glycogen synthesis by reducing the activity of glucokinase (1) and glycogen synthase (2). However, glucagon promotes glycogen breakdown by activating glycogen phosphorylase (3) and G6Pase (4). Second, glucagon promotes net gluconeogenesis. The hormone inhibits glycolysis and carbohydrate oxidation by reducing the activity of glucokinase (1), phosphofructokinase (5), and pyruvate kinase (6). Glucagon also stimulates gluconeogenesis by increasing the transcription of PEPCK (9), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (10), and G6Pase (4). Third, glucagon promotes the oxidation of fats. The hormone inhibits the activity of acetyl CoA carboxylase (11). Glucagon indirectly stimulates fat oxidation because the decreased levels of malonyl CoA relieve the inhibition of malonyl CoA on CAT (13). The numbering scheme for these reactions is the same as that in Figure 51-8.
bodies. These keto acids can exit the mitochondria and the liver to be used by other tissues as oxidative fuel.

During fasting, the decline in insulin and the increase in glucagon promote ketogenesis (see pp. 1185-1187); this process is of vital importance to the CNS, which can use keto acids but not fatty acids as fuel. In the adaptation to fasting, glucagon therefore plays the important role of stimulating
the conversion of fatty acids to ketones and provides the brain with the fuel that is needed to allow continued function during a fast. We discuss fasting in more depth beginning on pages 1188-1192. 11 11-10

In addition to its effects on hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, glucagon also has the extrahepatic actions of accelerating lipolysis in adipose tissue and proteolysis in

# N51-10 Fasting 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

During fasting, falling insulin levels and rising glucagon levels promote the conversion of stored fat to ketone bodies and promote gluconeogenesis from muscle protein.

Insulin and glucagon are the principal regulators of body fuel metabolism. The integrated secretion and action of insulin and glucagon are vital to fuel homeostasis. In humans, after an overnight fast, plasma [insulin] is low. The low [insulin] and the availability of glucagon result in the production of glucose by the liver from the breakdown of endogenous glycogen as well as from the conversion of noncarbohydrate substrates into glucose (i.e., gluconeogenesis). These processes are highly regulated so that the rate at which glucose is produced by the liver matches the rate at which it is used by tissues, especially by the CNS. If the amount of glucose being provided by the liver is inadequate, plasma [glucose] will decline. The $\beta$ cell, sensing this decrease, reduces the amount of insulin being secreted, whereas the $\alpha$ cell increases glucagon secretion. These two changes will increase glucose production by the liver and correct the plasma [glucose] toward normal. Conversely, if glucose is being overproduced and plasma [glucose] rises, insulin secretion increases and glucagon secretion is suppressed. Hepatic glucose production therefore declines and plasma [glucose] returns toward normal.

If fasting continues for several more days, insulin secretion continues to decline and glucagon secretion increases. The decline in insulin concentration allows an increased rate of proteolysis in muscle and mobilization of fatty acids from adipose tissue. The amino acids released by muscle serve as a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis. This response is particularly important after the first several days of fasting, when hepatic glycogen stores have been depleted and gluconeogenesis is the major pathway of hepatic glucose production. At the same time, the increased glucagon concentration stimulates ketogenesis in the liver and provides ketone bodies for the CNS. Ketones provide an alternative fuel source for the brain that allows the brain to decrease its use of glucose. Because most of the glucose comes from gluconeogenesis-and because the building blocks for gluconeogenesis come from accelerated proteolysis-the availability of ketone bodies allows the body to use the energy stored in fat and spare body protein. Because much of this body protein comes from the structural proteins in skeletal muscle and because catabolism of these proteins impairs muscle function (such as strength and mobility), it is a clear survival advantage to have the brain burn fat and not protein for fuel.

We discuss fasting beginning on pages 1188-1192.

muscle. However, these effects are generally demonstrable only with high concentrations of glucagon, and although they may be important in certain pathological situations associated with greatly elevated glucagon concentrations (e.g., ketoacidosis or sepsis), they appear less important in the day-to-day actions of glucagon.

## SOMATOSTATIN

## Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of growth hormone, insulin, and other hormones

Somatostatin is made in the $\delta$ cells of the pancreatic islets (see Fig. 51-1), as well as in the D cells of the gastrointestinal tract (see pp. 868-870), in the hypothalamus, and in several other sites in the CNS (see pp. 993-994). Somatostatin was first described as a hypothalamic peptide that suppresses the release of growth hormone; growth hormone had also been called somatotropin, which accounts for the name somatostatin. In both pancreatic $\delta$ cells and the hypothalamus, somatostatin exists as both 14- and 28 -amino-acid peptides. In the hypothalamus, the 14 -amino-acid form is predominant, whereas in the gastrointestinal tract (including the $\delta$ cells), the 28 -amino-acid form predominates. The 14 -amino-acid form is the C-terminal portion of the 28 -aminoacid form. The biological activity of somatostatin resides in these 14 amino acids.

Somatostatin inhibits the secretion of multiple hormones, including growth hormone, insulin, glucagon, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and thyroid-stimulating
hormone. This property has led to therapeutic use of a longacting somatostatin analog (octreotide) in some difficult-totreat endocrine tumors, including those that produce growth hormone (acromegaly), insulin (insulinoma), or serotonin (carcinoid), among others. The concentration of somatostatin found in pancreatic venous drainage is sufficiently high to inhibit basal insulin secretion. Recall that blood flows from the center of each islet-which is where the bulk of the $\beta$ cells are-to the periphery of the islet-which is where the $\delta$ cells tend to be located (see Fig. 51-1). This spatial arrangement minimizes the effect of somatostatin on the islet from which it is secreted. Whether somatostatin has important paracrine actions on some $\beta$ cells or on $\alpha$ cells remains controversial.

The islet cells also make other peptides; for example, pancreatic polypeptide is made in the F cells of the pancreas. As with insulin and glucagon, secretion of pancreatic polypeptide is altered by dietary intake of nutrients. However, whether pancreatic polypeptide has any actions in mammalian fuel metabolism is not clearly understood.

Occasionally, islet cell tumors may develop and secrete gastrin, VIP, growth hormone-releasing factor, or other hormones. Although these individual instances prove that these peptides can be made by islet tissue, they have no known normal function in the islet.

# THE PARATHYROID GLANDS AND VITAMIN D 

Eugene J. Barrett and Paula Q. Barrett

## CALCIUM AND PHOSPHATE BALANCE

Calcium plays a critical role in many cellular processes, including hormone secretion, muscle contraction, nerve conduction, exocytosis, and the activation and inactivation of many enzymes. As described in Chapter 3, calcium also serves as an intracellular second messenger by carrying information from the cell membrane into the interior of the cell. It is therefore not surprising that the body very carefully regulates the plasma concentration of free ionized calcium, the physiologically active form of the ion, and maintains plasma ionized calcium concentration within a narrow range.

Phosphate is no less important. Because it is part of the ATP molecule, phosphate plays a critical role in cellular energy metabolism. It also plays crucial roles in the activation and deactivation of enzymes. However, unlike calcium, the plasma phosphate concentration is not strictly regulated, and its levels fluctuate throughout the day, particularly after meals.

Calcium and phosphate homeostasis are intimately tied to each other for two reasons. First, calcium and phosphate are the principal components of hydroxyapatite crystals $\left[\mathrm{Ca}_{10}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}\right]$, which by far constitute the major portion of the mineral phase of bone. Second, they are regulated by the same hormones, primarily parathyroid hormone (PTH) and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol) and, to a lesser extent, the hormone calcitonin. These hormones act on three organ systems-bone, kidneys, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract-to control the levels of calcium and phosphate in plasma. However, the actions of these hormones on calcium and phosphate are typically opposed in that a particular hormone may elevate the level of one ion while lowering that of the other. Figures 52-1 and 52-2 depict the overall daily balance of calcium and phosphate for an individual in a steady state.

## The gut, kidneys, and bone regulate calcium balance

In plasma, calcium exists in three physicochemical forms: (1) as a free ionized species $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$, (2) bound to (more accurately, associated with) anionic sites on serum proteins (especially albumin), and (3) complexed with low-molecularweight organic anions (e.g., phosphate, citrate, and oxalate). The total concentration of all three forms in the plasma is normally 2.2 to $2.6 \mathrm{mM}(8.8$ to $10.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$. In healthy
individuals, $\sim 45 \%$ of calcium is free, $45 \%$ is bound to protein, and $10 \%$ is bound to small anions. The body tightly regulates the ionized form of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ between 1.0 and $1.3 \mathrm{mM}(4.0$ and $5.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$. The ionized form is the most important with regard to regulating the secretion of PTH and is involved in most of the biological actions of calcium.

Most total-body calcium is located within bone, $\sim 1 \mathrm{~kg}$ (see Fig. 52-1). The total amount of calcium in the extracellular pool is only a tiny fraction of this amount, $\sim 1 \mathrm{~g}$ or 1000 mg . The typical daily dietary intake of calcium is $\sim 800$ to 1200 mg . Dairy products are the major dietary source of calcium. Although the intestines absorb approximately one half the dietary calcium ( $\sim 500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day), they also secrete calcium for removal from the body ( $\sim 325 \mathrm{mg} /$ day), and therefore, the net intestinal uptake of calcium is only $\sim 175 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. The second major organ governing calcium homeostasis is bone, which in the steady state deposits $\sim 280 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of calcium and resorbs an equal amount. The third organ system involved, the kidney, filters $\sim 10$ times the total extracellular pool of calcium per day, $\sim 10,000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. The kidneys reabsorb $\sim 99 \%$ of this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, so that the net renal excretion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is $\sim 1 \%$ of the filtered load (see Fig. 36-16). In a person in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ balance, urinary excretion ( $\sim 175 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) matches net absorption by the GI tract.

## The gut, kidneys, and bone also regulate phosphate balance

The concentration of total phosphate in adult plasmapredominantly inorganic phosphate in the form of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$-ranges from 0.8 to 1.5 mM , a variation of $80 \%$. It is $\sim 50 \%$ higher in children. Laboratories report total plasma phosphate concentration as elemental phosphorus (range in adults, 2.5 to $4.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Between $85 \%$ and $90 \%$ of the circulating inorganic phosphate is filterable by the kidneys, either ionized ( $50 \%$ ) or complexed to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}(40 \%)$; only a small proportion ( $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ ) is protein bound.

Like calcium, most total-body phosphate is present in bone, which contains $\sim 0.6 \mathrm{~kg}$ of elemental phosphorus (see Fig. 52-2). A smaller amount of phosphorus $(0.1 \mathrm{~kg})$ resides in the soft tissues, mainly as organic phosphates, such as phospholipids, phosphoproteins, nucleic acids, and nucleotides. An even smaller amount ( $\sim 500 \mathrm{mg}$ ) is present in the extracellular fluid (ECF) as inorganic phosphate. The daily

dietary intake of phosphorus is typically 1400 mg , mostly as inorganic phosphate. Again, dairy products are the major source. The net absorption of phosphate by the intestines is $\sim 900 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. In the steady state, bone has relatively small phosphate turnover, $\sim 210 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. The kidneys filter $\sim 14$ times the total extracellular pool of phosphate per day ( $\sim 7000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) and reabsorb $\sim 6100 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Hence, the net renal excretion of phosphorus is $\sim 900 \mathrm{mg} /$ day, the same as the net absorption by the GI tract.

## PHYSIOLOGY OF BONE

## Dense cortical bone and the more reticulated trabecular bone are the two major bone types

Bone consists largely of an extracellular matrix composed of proteins and hydroxyapatite crystals, in addition to a small population of cells. The matrix provides strength and stability. The cellular elements continually remodel bone to accommodate growth and allow bone to reshape itself in response to varying loading stresses. Basically, bone has three types of bone cells. Osteoblasts promote bone formation. Osteoblasts and preosteoblasts are the principal target cells for PTH's action to stimulate bone growth. Osteoclasts promote bone resorption and are found on the growth
surfaces of bone. Their activity is increased by cytokines, with RANK ligand being particularly important. Osteocytes are found within the bony matrix and are derived from osteoblasts that have encased themselves within bone. In response to mechanical loading, osteocytes produced both stimulatory and inhibitory cues. These cells stimulate the bone-forming activities of osteoblasts and lining cells by secreting growth factors such as osteocalcin and Wnt ligands. Osteocytes inhibit osteoblast activity by secreting antagonists of Wnt signaling, including sclerostin and dickkopf1. Osteocytes also appear to play a role in the transfer of mineral from the interior of bone to the growth surfaces. Bone remodeling consists of a carefully coordinated interplay of osteoblastic, osteocytic, and osteoclastic activities.

As shown in Figure 52-3, bone consists of two types of bone tissue. Cortical (also called compact or lamellar) bone represents $\sim 80 \%$ of the total bone mass. Cortical bone is the outer layer (the cortex) of all bones and forms the bulk of the long bones of the body. It is a dense tissue composed mostly of bone mineral and extracellular matrix elements, interrupted only by penetrating blood vessels and a sparse population of osteocytes nested within the bone. These osteocytes are interconnected with one another and with the osteoblasts on the surface of the bone by canaliculi, through which the osteocytes extend cellular processes. These
![bo596000512f](bo596000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-3 Cortical and trabecular bone. Under the periosteum is a layer of compact cortical bone that surrounds the more reticulated trabecular bone. The fundamental unit of cortical bone is the osteon, a tube-like structure that consists of a haversian canal surrounded by ring-like lamellae. The inset shows a cross section through an osteon. The superficial lining cells surround the osteoblasts, which secrete osteoid, a matrix of proteins that are the organic part of bone. The lining cells are formed from osteoblasts that become quiescent. Osteocytes are osteoblasts that have become surrounded by matrix. Canaliculi allow the cellular processes of osteocytes to communicate, via gap junctions, with each other and with osteoblasts on the surface. Trabecular bone has both osteoblasts and osteoclasts on its surface; this is where most bone remodeling takes place.

connections permit the transfer of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the interior of the bone to the surface, a process called osteocytic osteolysis. Dense cortical bone provides much of the strength for weight bearing by the long bones.

Trabecular (or cancellous or medullary) bone constitutes $\sim 20 \%$ of the total bone mass. It is found in the interior of bones and is especially prominent within the vertebral bodies. It is composed of thin spicules of bone that extend from the cortex into the medullary cavity (see Fig. 52-3, inset). The lacework of bone spicules is lined in many areas by osteoblasts and osteoclasts, the cells involved in bone remodeling. Trabecular bone is constantly being synthesized and resorbed by these cellular elements. Bone turnover also occurs in cortical bone, but the fractional rate of turnover is much lower. When the rate of bone resorption exceeds that of synthesis over time, the loss of bone mineral produces the disease osteoporosis.

## The extracellular matrix forms the nidus for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals

Collagen and the other extracellular matrix proteins that form the protein matrix of bone are called osteoid. Osteoid provides sites for the nucleation of hydroxyapatite crystals, the mineral component of bone. Osteoid is not a single compound, but a highly organized matrix of proteins synthesized principally by osteoblasts. Type I collagen accounts for $\sim 90 \%$ of the protein mass of osteoid. It comprises a triple helix of two $\alpha 1$ monomers and one $\alpha 2$ collagen monomer. While still within the osteoblast, monomers self-associate into helical structures. After secretion from the osteoblast, helices associate into collagen fibers; cross-linking of collagen occurs both within a fiber and between fibers. Collagen fibers are arranged in the osteoid in a highly ordered manner. The organization of collagen fibers is important for the tensile strength (i.e., the ability to resist stretch or bending) of bone. In addition to providing tensile strength, collagen also acts as a nidus for nucleation of bone mineralization. Within the collagen fibers, the crystals of hydroxyapatite are arranged with their long axis aligned with the long axis of the collagen fibers.

Several other osteoblast-derived proteins are important to the mineralization process, including osteocalcin and osteonectin. Osteocalcin is a $6-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein synthesized by osteoblasts at sites of new bone formation. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D induces the synthesis of osteocalcin. Osteocalcin has an unusual structure: it possesses three $\gamma$-carboxylated glutamic acid residues. These residues are formed by post-translational modification of glutamic acid by vitamin K-dependent enzymes. Like other proteins with $\gamma$-carboxylated glutamic acid, osteocalcin binds $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ avidly. It binds hydroxyapatite, the crystalline mineral of bone, with even greater avidity. This observation has led to the suggestion that osteocalcin participates in the nucleation of bone mineralization at the crystal surface. Osteonectin, a $35-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein, is another osteoblast product that binds to hydroxyapatite. It also binds to collagen fibers and facilitates the mineralization of collagen fibers in vitro. Additional proteins have been identified that appear to participate in the mineralization process. For instance, extracellular glycoproteins present in bone may
inhibit mineralization and their removal may be necessary for mineralization to occur.

## Bone remodeling depends on the closely coupled activities of osteoblasts and osteoclasts

In addition to providing the proteins in osteoid, osteoblasts promote mineralization by exporting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ from intracellular vesicles that have accumulated these minerals. Exocytosis of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{PO}_{4}^{3-}$ raises the local extracellular concentration of these ions around the osteoblast to levels that are higher than in the bulk ECF, which promotes crystal nucleation and growth (Fig. 52-4). Bone formation along spicules of trabecular bone occurs predominantly at sites of previous resorption by osteoclasts. The processes of bone resorption and synthesis are thus spatially coupled within an active basic multicellular unit (BMU). In adults, 1 to 2 million BMUs actively remodel bone.

Vitamin D and PTH stimulate osteoblastic cells to secrete factors-such as macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF; see p. 431)-that cause osteoclast precursors to proliferate (see Fig. 52-4). These precursors differentiate into mononuclear osteoclasts and then, with further stimulation by RANK ligand (also released by PTH-stimulated osteoblasts), fuse to become multinucleated osteoclasts. Osteoclasts resorb bone in discrete areas in contact with the "ruffled border" of the cell (Fig. 52-5). The osteoclast closely attaches to the bone matrix when integrins on its membrane attach to vitronectin in the bone matrix. The osteoclast-in reality a one-cell epithelium-then secretes acid and proteases across its ruffled border membrane into a confined resorption space (the lacuna). The acid secretion is mediated by a V-type H pump (see pp. 118-119) and the $\mathrm{ClC}-7 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channel at the ruffled border membrane. Abundant intracellular carbonic anhydrase provides the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exchangers, located in the membrane that faces the blood, remove the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$formed as a byproduct by the carbonic anhydrase. The acidic environment beneath the osteoclast dissolves bone mineral and allows acid proteases to hydrolyze the exposed matrix proteins. Having reabsorbed some of the bone in a very localized area, the osteoclast moves away from the pit or trough in the bone that it has created. Osteoblastic cells replace the osteoclast and now build new bone matrix and promote its mineralization.

RANK ligand (RANKL), previously called osteoprotegerin ligand, appears to be a major stimulator of both the differentiation of preosteoclasts to osteoclasts (see Fig. 52-4) and the activity of mature osteoclasts (see Fig. 52-5). RANKL is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) cytokine family and exists both as a membrane-bound form (mRANKL) on the surface of stromal cells and osteoblasts, and as a soluble protein (sRANKL) secreted by these same cells. RANKL binds to and stimulates a membrane-bound receptor of the osteoclast called RANK (receptor for activation of nuclear factor $\kappa B$ ), a member of the TNF receptor family. The interaction is essential for the formation of mature osteoclasts.

The activity of RANKL is under the control of a soluble member of the TNF receptor family called osteoprotegerin (OPG; from the Latin osteo [bone] + protegere [to protect]).

![bo606000512f](bo606000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-4 Bone formation and resorption. PTH and vitamin D stimulate osteoblastic cells to secrete agents that induce stem cells to differentiate into osteoclast precursors, mononuclear osteoclasts, and finally mature, multinucleated osteoclasts. Thus, PTH indirectly promotes bone resorption. Osteoblasts also secrete $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and inorganic phosphate ( P ), which nucleate on the surface of bone. IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor.

Like RANKL, OPG is produced by osteoblastic and stromal cells (see Fig. 52-4). By scavenging RANKL, OPG limits osteoclastogenesis, thereby protecting bone from osteoclastic activity. The precise role of RANKL, RANK, and OPG in the development of various forms of osteoporosis (diminished bone density) and osteopetrosis (increased bone density) is only beginning to be understood. However, the balance between OPG and RANKL production by the osteoblast/stromal cell appears to be a very important factor in the development of osteoporosis from either estrogen deficiency or glucocorticoid excess. In both cases, RANKL production rises and OPG production falls. In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved denosumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against RANKL, for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.

In rare human monogenic syndromes, defects of the Wnt signaling system are associated with marked increases or decreases in bone mass. Moreover, targeted disruption of specific Wnt antagonists in mice reveals the major role of Wnt in osteoblastogenesis and in modulation of the activity of both osteoblasts and osteocytes. Wnt increases the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells and preosteoblasts, thereby increasing bone-forming capacity. In addition, Wnt increases the production of OPG, which competes with RANKL and thereby decreases osteoclastogenesis. New therapies to treat or prevent bone loss based on manipulation of Wnt signaling offer substantial promise.

## PARATHYROID HORMONE

## Plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ regulates the synthesis and secretion of PTH

Humans have four parathyroid glands, two located on the posterior surface of the left lobe of the thyroid and two more on the right. Combined, these four glands weigh $<500 \mathrm{mg}$. They are composed largely of chief cells, which are responsible for the synthesis and secretion of PTH. These cells, like cells that secrete other peptide hormones, are highly specialized to synthesize, process, and secrete their product. The major regulator of PTH secretion is ionized plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, although vitamin D also plays a role. Both inhibit the synthesis or release of PTH. In contrast, an increase in plasma phosphorus concentration stimulates PTH release.

PTH Synthesis and Vitamin D The PTH gene possesses upstream regulatory elements in the $5^{\prime}$ region, including response elements for both vitamins D and A (see p. 90). The vitamin D response element binds a vitamin D receptor (VDR) when the receptor is occupied by a vitamin D metabolite, usually 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The VDR is a member of the family of nuclear receptors, like the steroid hormone and thyroid hormone receptors. Like the thyroid hormone receptor, VDR forms a heterodimer with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and acts as a transcription factor (see

![bo616000512f](bo616000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-5 Bone resorption by the osteoclast. The osteoclast moves along the surface of bone and settles down, sealing itself to the bone via integrins that bind to vitronectins on the bone surface. The osteoclast reabsorbs bone by secreting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and acid proteases into the lacuna. Thus, the osteoclast behaves as a one-cell epithelium. The acid secretion is mediated by a V-type H pump and $\mathrm{ClC7} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel at the ruffled border membrane facing the lacuna. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the cytosol supplies the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to the H pump and also produces $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$as a byproduct. $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers-located on the membrane opposite the ruffled border-remove this $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. AC, adenylyl cyclase; IL-6R, interleukin-6 receptor; PKA, protein kinase A; TRAP, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase.

Table 3-6). The receptor has a very high affinity for the 1,25-dihydroxylated form of vitamin $\mathrm{D}\left(K_{\mathrm{D}} \cong 10^{-10} \mathrm{M}\right)$, less affinity for the 25 -hydroxy form $\left(K_{\mathrm{D}} \cong 10^{-7} \mathrm{M}\right)$, and little affinity for the parent vitamin (either $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$, see below). Binding of the vitamin D-VDR complex to the VDR response element decreases the rate of PTH transcription.

Processing of PTH After transport of the mature PTH messenger RNA (mRNA) to the cytosol, PTH is synthesized on ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and begins its journey through the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35). PTH is transcribed as a prepro-PTH of 115 amino acids (Fig. 52-6). The 25 -amino-acid "pre" fragment targets PTH for transport into the lumen of the RER. This signal sequence (see p. 28) appears to be cleaved as PTH enters the RER. During transit through the secretory pathway, the 90 -amino-acid pro-PTH is further processed to the mature, active, 84 -amino-acid PTH. This cleavage appears quite efficient, and no pro-PTH appears in the storage granules. Conversely, the breakdown of 1-84 PTH or
"intact" PTH into its N - and C-terminal fragments-as discussed below-already starts in the secretory granules.

Metabolism of PTH Once secreted, PTH circulates free in plasma and is rapidly metabolized; the half-life of 1-84 PTH is $\sim 4$ minutes. Beginning in the secretory granules inside the parathyroid chief cells and continuing in the circulationpredominantly in the liver-PTH is cleaved into two principal fragments, a 33- or 36-amino-acid N-terminal peptide and a larger C-terminal peptide (see Fig. 52-6). Virtually all the known biological activity of PTH resides in the N -terminal fragment, which is rapidly hydrolyzed, especially in the kidney. However, the half-life of the C-terminal fragment is much longer than that of either the N -terminal peptide or the intact 84 -amino-acid PTH molecule. An estimated $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the PTH-derived peptide in the circulation is represented by the biologically inactive C-terminal fragment. The presence of a significant amount of antigenically recognized but biologically inactive C-terminal fragments in the circulation has complicated the use of the usual

![bo626000512f](bo626000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-6 PTH synthesis. The synthesis of PTH begins with the production of prepro-PTH (115 amino acids) in the RER. Cleavage of the signal sequence in the ER lumen yields pro-PTH (90 amino acids). During transit through the secretory pathway, enzymes in the Golgi cleave the "pro" sequence, yielding the mature or "intact" PTH (84 amino acids), which is stored in secretory granules. Beginning in the secretory granule, enzymes cleave PTH into two fragments. The N-terminal fragment is either 33 or 36 amino acids in length and contains all of the biological activity.
radioimmunoassay methods for measuring PTH in both clinical and experimental settings. This problem has been solved by the development of sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that use two antibodies that react with two distinct sites on the PTH molecule and measure only the intact PTH hormone (i.e., 84 amino acids). These assays are invaluable in the diagnosis of disorders of PTH secretion, particularly when kidney function is impaired (a circumstance that further prolongs the half-life of the inactive C-terminal metabolites). ( $\mathrm{N52-1}$

## High plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ inhibits the synthesis and release of PTH

To a first approximation, and ignoring the contributions of vitamin D that are discussed below, regulation of PTH secretion by plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ appears to be a simple negativefeedback loop. The major stimulus for PTH secretion is a decline in the concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the blood (hypocalcemia) and ECF. Hypocalcemia also stimulates synthesis of new PTH, which is necessary because the parathyroid gland contains only enough PTH to maintain a stimulated secretory response for several hours.

Using cultured parathyroid chief cells (which like the parathyroids in vivo respond to very small decreases in the concentration of ionized $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), investigators identified a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensing receptor (CaSR) that resides in the plasma membrane of the parathyroid cell (Fig. 52-7A). This receptor binds $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in a saturable manner, with an affinity profile that is similar to the concentration dependence for PTH secretion. CaSR is a member of the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (see pp. 51-66). Coupling of this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ receptor to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$ activates phospholipase C , which generates inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG) and

B RESPONSE OF PARATHYROID GLAND TO CHANGES IN PLASMA $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$
![bo646000512f](bo646000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-7 PTH secretion and its dependence on ionized $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the plasma. A, Four parathyroid glands lie on the posterior side of the thyroid. The chief cells synthesize, store, and secrete PTH. Increases in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ inhibit PTH secretion in the following manner: $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to a receptor that is coupled to a heterotrimeric G protein, $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$, which activates phospholipase C (PLC). This enzyme converts phosphoinositides (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, or $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ ) to $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAGs. The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ causes the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, whereas the DAG stimulates PKC. Paradoxically, both the elevated $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and the stimulated PKC inhibit release of granules containing PTH. Increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{c}$ also inhibits PTH synthesis. Thus, increased levels of plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ lower PTH release and therefore tend to lower plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. B, Small decreases in free plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ greatly increase the rate of PTH release. About half of the total plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is free. In patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH), the curve is shifted to the right; that is, plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ must rise to higher levels before inhibiting PTH secretion. As a result, these patients have normal PTH levels, but elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

# N52-1 Historical Assays for PTH 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

On pages 1059-1060, we discuss the modern methods for assaying intact PTH. In the past, clinicians exploited the effects of PTH on renal phosphate transport and renal cAMP production to assay biologically active PTH levels. Both the renal threshold $\left(T_{r 0}\right)$ for phosphate (see p. 786 and Fig. 36-15) and the rate of urinary excretion of cAMP are readily determined in humans and are indirect measures of plasma PTH levels. In the case of cAMP, one actually measures the excretion of "nephrogenous" cAMP; that is, the total urinary cAMP minus the amount of cAMP filtered in the glomeruli.

With the advent of the newer PTH assays, these tests have largely been discarded in clinical settings.

results in the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores and the activation of protein kinase C (PKC; see pp. 60-61). Unlike most endocrine tissues, in which activation of these signaling systems promotes a secretory response, in the parathyroid the rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and activation of PKC inhibit hormone secretion. (Another example is the granular cell of the juxtaglomerular apparatus, in which an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ inhibits secretion of renin; see p. 842). Thus, increasing levels of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ decrease PTH secretion (see Fig. 52-7B).

## The PTH receptor couples via G proteins to either adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C

The action of PTH to regulate plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ is secondary to its binding to the PTH 1R receptor (PTH1R). A second PTH receptor, PTH2R, has been identified. However, its role, if any, in the regulation of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ is uncertain. Kidney and bone have the greatest abundance of PTH1R. Within the kidney, PTH1R is most abundant in the proximal and distal convoluted tubules. In bone, the preosteoblast and osteoblast appear to be the major target cells. PTH1R is a GPCR (see pp. 51-66) that binds some N-terminal fragments of PTH, the biologically active 1-34 peptide, as well as the 1-84 intact PTH molecule (see Fig. 52-6). PTH1R also binds PTH-related protein (PTHrP), which is discussed below. In contrast, PTH2R is selectively activated by PTH.

A CONTROL OF PLASMA CALCIUM
![bo656000512f](bo656000512f.jpg)

PTH1R appears to be coupled to two heterotrimeric G proteins and thus to two signal-transduction systems. Binding of PTH to the receptor stimulates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{s}$, which in turn activates adenylyl cyclase and thus releases cAMP and stimulates protein kinase A (see pp. 56-57). The activated PTH receptor also stimulates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$, which in turn stimulates phospholipase C (see p. 58) to generate $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and DAG. The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ releases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, thus increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and activating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent kinases. In humans, the bone PTH receptor on osteoblastic cells is identical to that present in renal cortical cells.
As discussed in the next two sections, the net effects of PTH on the kidney and bone are to increase plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ and to lower plasma [phosphate].

## In the kidney, PTH promotes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption, phosphate loss, and 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D

PTH exerts a spectrum of actions on target cells in the kidney and bone, as illustrated for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in Figure 52-8A and for phosphate in Figure 52-8B. In renal tubules, PTH receptors are located on the basolateral membrane. Binding of PTH to its receptors activates dual intracellular signaling systems and in this manner modifies transepithelial transport.

B CONTROL OF PLASMA PHOSPHATE
![bo666000512f](bo666000512f.jpg)

Figure 52-8 Feedback loops in the control of plasma calcium and phosphate levels. The three major regulators are PTH released by parathyroid chief cells; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D released by renal proximal-tubule cells; and, in the case of phosphate, FGF23 released by osteocytes. Plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration feeds back on the parathyroid glands, whereas plasma inorganic phosphate ( P ) concentration feeds back on osteocytes.

Stimulation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Reabsorption A key action of PTH is to promote the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the thick ascending limb (TAL) and distal convoluted tubule (DCT) of the kidney (see p. 789). Most of the $\sim 25 \mathrm{mmol}$ of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ filtered each day is reabsorbed in the proximal tubule ( 65\%) and TAL ( 25\%). The distal nephron is responsible for reabsorbing an additional $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the filtered load of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, with $\sim 0.5 \%$ of the filtered load left in the urine. Thus, when PTH stimulates distal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption, it greatly decreases the amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excreted in the urine (usually 4 to $5 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day) and tends to raise plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ (see Fig. 52-8A).

Greater fractional $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion occurs when $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the proximal tubule, TAL, or DCT is impaired, as occurs with osmotic or loop diuretics or hypoparathyroidism. As discussed below, vitamin D has a synergistic action to promote $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the DCT.

Inhibition of Phosphate Reabsorption PTH reduces phosphate reabsorption in the proximal tubule, producing a characteristic phosphaturia and decreasing plasma phosphate levels (see Fig. 52-8B). This phosphaturia results from a PTH-induced redistribution of Na/phosphate cotransporters (NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc; see pp. 785-786) away from the apical membrane of the renal proximal tubule and into a pool of subapical vesicles (see pp. 786-787). Note that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23; see p. 787), released by osteocytes in response to high plasma $\left[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right]$, also inhibits NaPi-IIa and NaPi-IIc and thus phosphate reabsorption (see Fig. 52-8B). Conversely, a PTH-induced decrease in plasma $\left[\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right]$ inhibits the release of FGF23, which in turn promotes P , reabsorption, countering the action of PTH.

As discussed below, PTH stimulates bone to resorb calcium and phosphate from the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone mineral. Thus, PTH stimulates both steps in the movement of phosphate from bone to blood to urine. Elimination of phosphate via the urine plays an important role when elevated levels of PTH liberate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate from bone. At normal plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphorus concentrations, the $\mathrm{Ca} \times \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ion product approaches the solubility product. Clinically, this product is measured as total plasma calcium (in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) $\times$ plasma elemental phosphorus (in mg/ dL). Further, PTH-induced increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$-if accompanied by a rise in phosphate levels-would cause calcium phosphate salts to precipitate out of the soluble phase, at least partly negating the action of PTH to raise plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Thus, PTH-induced phosphaturia diminishes the $\mathrm{Ca} \times \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ion product and prevents precipitation when $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ mobilization is needed. The body tightly regulates plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ but allows plasma levels of phosphate to vary more widely.

In addition to affecting phosphate reabsorption, PTH decreases the proximal-tubule reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see p. 829) and of several amino acids. These actions appear to play a relatively minor role in whole-body acid-base and nitrogen metabolism, respectively.

Stimulation of the Last Step of Synthesis of 1,25Dihydroxyvitamin D A third important renal action of PTH is to stimulate the 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the mitochondria of the proximal tubule. The resulting 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D is the most biologically active metabolite of dietary or endogenously produced vitamin D.

Its synthesis by the kidney is highly regulated, and PTH is the primary stimulus to increase 1-hydroxylation. Note that hyperphosphatemia elevates plasma FGF23, which inhibit this hydroxylation (see Fig. 52-8B). Conversely, hypophosphatemia, either spontaneous or induced by the phosphaturic action of PTH, also promotes the production of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. As discussed on pages 10651067, the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D formed in the proximal tubule has three major actions: (1) enhancement of renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption, (2) enhancement of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption by the small intestine, and (3) modulation of the movement of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate in and out of bone (Box 52-1).

## BOX 52-1 Familial Hypocalciuric Hypercalcemia

The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ receptor on the parathyroid cell is mutated in patients with the disorder familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH). Plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ level in these patients is typically elevated $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ above the normal range. These patients generally tolerate this elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ very well. The finding of a total plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ of 3.0 to 3.3 mM (12 to $13 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )-the normal range is 2.2 to 2.6 mM ( 8.8 to $10.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ )-is frequently more alarming to the physician than to the patient. Despite having a plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ that would make most people symptomatic with kidney stones, fatigue, or loss of mental concentration, these patients have remarkably few symptoms, presumably because they have adapted to the hypercalcemia since birth. The amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ present in their urine is typically less than normal (hence the designation hypocalciurid) and much lower than that encountered in persons with hypercalcemia due to other causes. Despite the high plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, the plasma [PTH] in FHH patients is typically normal. The normal [PTH] suggests that regulation of PTH secretion is intact but the set-point at which the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ turns off PTH secretion is shifted toward a higher plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ (see Fig. 52-7B).

FHH is an autosomal dominant disorder, and several different point mutations have been identified in different families. Heterozygotes express both normal and mutated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ receptors. Rarely, infants are born with the homozygous disorder (i.e., both copies of the receptor are defective). These infants have very severe hypercalcemia ( $>15 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) and severe hyperparathyroidism. The condition is life threatening and is characterized by markedly elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, neuronal malfunction, demineralization of bone, and calcification of soft tissues. These infants die unless the inappropriately regulated parathyroid glands are removed.

Like the parathyroid gland, the renal TAL and DCT have abundant plasma-membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ receptors on their basolateral membranes. These receptors respond to changes in plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption (see p. 789). Thus, with a mutated receptor, renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption may not be inhibited until plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ rises to abnormally high levels. The result would be the increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption and the hypocalciuria characteristic of FHH.

The discovery of CaSR led to the development of a CaSR agonist that mimics $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (a calcimimetic). This drug has now come into clinical use for treating patients with parathyroid cancer or hyperparathyroidism secondary to chronic renal disease. Calcimimetics decrease the secretion of PTH and secondarily decrease plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$.

## In bone, PTH can promote net resorption or net deposition

The second major target tissue for PTH is bone, in which PTH promotes both bone resorption and bone synthesis.

Bone Resorption by Indirect Stimulation of Osteoclasts The net effect of persistent increases of PTH on bone is to stimulate bone resorption, thus increasing plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Osteoblasts express abundant surface receptors for PTH; osteoclasts do not. Because osteoclasts lack PTH receptors, PTH by itself cannot regulate the coupling between osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Rather, PTH acts on osteoblasts and osteoclast precursors to induce the production of several cytokines that increase both the number and the activity of bone-resorbing osteoclasts. PTH causes osteoblasts to release agents such as M-CSF and stimulates the expression of RANKL, actions that promote the development of osteoclasts (see Fig. 52-4). In addition, PTH and vitamin D stimulate osteoblasts to release interleukin-6 (IL-6), which stimulates existing osteoclasts to resorb bone (see Fig. 52-5).

One of the initial clues that cytokines are important mediators of osteoclastic bone resorption came from observations on patients with multiple myeloma-a malignancy of plasma cells, which are of B-lymphocyte lineage. The tumor cells produce several proteins that activate osteoclasts and enhance bone resorption. These proteins were initially called osteoclast-activating factors. We now know that certain lymphocyte-derived proteins strongly activate osteoclastic bone resorption, including RANKL, lymphotoxin, IL-1, and TNF- $\alpha$.

Bone Resorption by Reduction in Bone Matrix PTH also changes the behavior of osteoblasts in a manner that can promote net loss of bone matrix. For example, PTH inhibits collagen synthesis by osteoblasts and also promotes the production of proteases that digest bone matrix. Digestion of matrix is important because osteoclasts do not easily reabsorb bone mineral if the bone has an overlying layer of unmineralized osteoid.

Bone Deposition Whereas persistent increases in PTH favor net resorption, intermittent increases in plasma [PTH] have predominately bone-synthetic effects, inducing higher rates of bone formation and mineral apposition. PTH promotes bone synthesis by three mechanisms. First, PTH promotes bone synthesis directly by activating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in osteocytes, a process that leads to a net transfer of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from bone fluid to the osteocyte. The osteocyte then transfers this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via gap junctions to the osteoblasts at the bone surface. This process is called osteocytic osteolysis. The osteoblasts then pump this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the extracellular matrix, which contributes to mineralization. Second, PTH decreases the production of sclerostin by osteocytes. Lower levels of plasma sclerostin and dickkopf1 promote osteoblastic differentiation and also inhibit osteoblastic apoptosis. Third, PTH stimulates bone synthesis indirectly in that osteoclastic bone resorption leads to the release of growth factors trapped within the matrix; these include insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-2, fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), and transforming growth factor- $\beta$. Finally, PTH stimulates osteoblasts
to produce OPG and thereby interfere with RANKL activation of osteoclasts.

The PTH 1-34 peptide is now available as a pharmacological agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. Clinical data show marked increases in bone density-particularly within the axial skeleton-in response to injections of PTH 1-34 once or twice daily. The effects on trabecular bone are striking, with less positive responses seen in cortical boneparticularly in the limbs.

## VITAMIN D

## The active form of vitamin D is its 1,25-dihydroxy metabolite

By the 1920s, investigators recognized that dietary deficiency of a fat-soluble vitamin was responsible for the childhood disease rickets (Box 52-2). This disorder is characterized

## BOX 52-2 Rickets and Osteomalacia

Deficiency of vitamin D in children produces the disease rickets, in which bone has abnormal amounts of unmineralized osteoid. Both cortical and trabecular bone are involved. The lack of mineralization diminishes bone rigidity and leads to a characteristic bowing of the long bones of the legs of affected children. In adults, vitamin D deficiency produces a disorder called osteomalacia. Microscopically, the bone looks very much the same in adult and childhood vitamin D deficiency. However, because the longitudinal growth of the long bones has been completed in adults, bowing of weight-bearing bones does not occur. Instead, the increased unmineralized osteoid content of bone causes a decline in bone strength. Affected individuals are more prone to the development of bone fractures. These fractures may be very small and difficult to see radiographically. As more and more of the bone surface is covered by osteoid and as recruitment of new osteoclasts is diminished, osteoclastic bone resorption is impaired and hypocalcemia develops. Hypocalcemia causes nerves to become more sensitive to depolarization. In sensory nerves, this effect leads to sensations of numbness, tingling, or burning; in motor nerves, it leads to increased spontaneous contractions, or tetany.

Although rickets and osteomalacia are very uncommon in developed countries because of vitamin D supplementation, milder degrees of vitamin D deficiency are recognized increasingly in the elderly population, in whom milk consumption and sunlight exposure are frequently inadequate. The resulting fall in plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ can lead to mild secondary hyperparathyroidism. Such continuous elevations of PTH can lead to further bone resorption and worsening osteoporosis.

Rickets or osteomalacia also can occur with impaired ability of the kidney to 1-hydroxylate the 25-hydroxyvitamin D previously synthesized in the liver. An acquired impairment is seen in many patients with chronic renal failure, in which the activity of $1 \alpha$-hydroxylase is reduced. The genetic form of the $1 \alpha$-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder. Either form is called vitamin D-dependent rickets because it can be successfully treated with either 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D or doses of dietary vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ that are higher (by $\sim 10-$ to 100 -fold) than the $400 \mathrm{U} /$ day used to prevent nutritional rickets.

# N52-2 Metabolism of Vitamin $D_{3}$ and $D_{2}$ 

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

## Vitamin $D_{3}$

Vitamin $D_{2}$-or cholecalciferol-actually can be thought of as a hormone because it can arise entirely from the metabolism of an endogenous source (7-dehydroxycholesterol) and because it acts through a specific receptor. Ultraviolet light triggers the cleavage in the skin of the B ring of 7dehydroxycholesterol, creating an unstable intermediate that-over a period of about 2 days-rearranges to form cholecalciferol (vitamin $D_{3}$ ). Vitamin $D_{3}$ can also come from animal sources in the diet. However, vitamin $D_{3}$ is not active as such. In the liver, a P-450 enzyme hydroxylates vitamin $D_{3}$ at the 25 position, creating 25 -hydroxyvitamin $D_{3}$. Then in the proximal-tubule cells of the kidney, another P-450 enzyme hydroxylates 25-hydroxyvitamin $D_{3}$ at position 1, forming 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin $D_{3}$, the active form of vitamin $D_{3}$.

## Vitamin $D_{2}$

Vitamin $D_{2}$, which comes exclusively from dietary plant sources, differs from vitamin $D_{3}$ only in the side chain off carbon 17 in ring $D$. Like vitamin $D_{3}$, vitamin $D_{3}$ undergoes 25-hydroxylation in the liver and 1-hydroxylation in the kidney. Also like vitamin $D_{3}$, the 1,25-dihydroxylated metabolite of vitamin $D_{2}$ is about 1000 -fold more active than the 25 monohydroxylated form.

clinically by hypocalcemia and multiple skeletal abnormalities. Dietary replacement of vitamin D corrects this disorder and has led to the practice of adding vitamin D to milk, bread, and other products. This practice has greatly reduced the prevalence of this previously common disorder.

Vitamin D exists in the body in two forms, vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ and vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (Fig. 52-9). ( $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ 52-2 Vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ can be synthesized from the 7-dehydrocholesterol that is present in the skin, provided sufficient ultraviolet light is absorbed. This observation explains why nutritional rickets was more prevalent in northern countries, where people have reduced skin exposure to sunlight. Vitamin $D_{3}$ is also available from several natural sources, including cod and halibut liver, eggs, and fortified milk. Vitamin $D_{2}$ is obtained only from the diet, largely from vegetables. Vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ (see Fig. 52-9A) and vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (see Fig. 52-9B) differ only in the side chains of ring D. The side chain in vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ (cholecalciferol) is characteristic of cholesterol, whereas that of vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ (ergocalciferol) is characteristic of plant sterols.

Vitamin D (i.e., either $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ ) is fat soluble, but water insoluble. Its absorption from the intestine depends on its solubilization by bile salts (see p. 933). In the circulation, vitamin D is found either solubilized with chylomicrons (see pp. 932-933) or associated with a vitamin D-binding protein. Most of the body stores of vitamin D are located in body fat. The body's pools of vitamin D are large, and only $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of the body's vitamin D is turned over each day. Therefore, several years of very low dietary intake (as well as diminished endogenous synthesis) are required before the endogenous pools are depleted and deficiency develops.

The principal active form of vitamin D is not vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$, but rather a dihydroxylated metabolite of either. Hydroxylation of vitamin D proceeds in two steps (see Fig. 52-9A). When circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are low, adipocytes release vitamin D into the blood plasma. A cytochrome P-450 mixed-function oxidase, principally in the liver, creates the first hydroxyl group at carbon 25. The 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D does not appear to be highly regulated, but rather it depends on the availability of vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{D}_{3}$. The second hydroxylation reaction occurs in the renal proximal tubule under the tight control of PTH, vitamin D itself, and FGF23 (see p. 787). PTH stimulates this 1-hydroxylation, whereas FGF23 and 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D (the reaction product) both inhibit the process (see Fig. 52-8).

In addition to vitamins $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ and their respective 25-hydroxy and 1,25-dihydroxy metabolites, $>15$ other metabolites of vitamin D have been identified in plasma. However, the specific physiological function of these metabolites, if any, is unclear.

Although considered a vitamin because of its dietary requirement, vitamin D can also be considered a hormone, both because it is endogenously synthesized and because even the fraction that arises from the diet must be metabolized to a biologically active form.

Vitamin D and its metabolites, like the steroid hormones, circulate bound to a globulin, in this case a $52-\mathrm{kDa}$ vitamin D-binding protein. This binding protein appears

particularly important for carriage of vitamins $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ in plasma because they are less soluble than their hydroxylated metabolites. Vitamin D and its metabolites arrive at target tissues and, once in the cytosol, associate with the VDR, a transcription factor that is in the family of nuclear receptors (see pp. 71-72). Like the thyroid hormone receptor (see Table 3-6), VDR forms a heterodimer with RXR. The VDR specifically recognizes the 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D with an affinity that is three orders of magnitude higher than that for 25-hydroxyvitamin D. However, because the circulating concentration of 25-hydroxyvitamin D is $\sim 1000$-fold higher than that of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, both species probably contribute to the biological actions of the hormone.

The biological actions of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D appear to be expressed principally, but not exclusively, via regulation of the transcription of a variety of proteins. The VDR/RXR complex associates with a regulatory site in the promoter region of the genes coding for certain vitamin D-regulated proteins. Thus, the occupied VDR alters the synthesis of these vitamin D-dependent proteins. An example is PTH, which stimulates the formation of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. The $5^{\prime}$ regulatory region of the PTH gene has a VDR consensus sequence; when occupied by the VDR complex, this element diminishes transcription of the PTH gene.

## Vitamin D, by acting on the small intestine and kidney, raises plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ and thus promotes bone mineralization

The actions of vitamin D can be grouped into two categories: actions on classic target tissues involved in regulating body mineral and skeletal homeostasis, and a more general action that regulates cell growth. The actions of vitamin D on the small intestine, bone, and kidney serve to prevent any abnormal decline or rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$.

Small Intestine In the duodenum, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D increases the production of several proteins that enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption. Figure 52-10A summarizes the intestinal absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which moves from the intestinal lumen to the blood by both paracellular and transcellular routes (see p. 938). In the paracellular route, which occurs throughout the small intestine, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ moves passively from the lumen to the blood; 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D does not regulate this pathway. The transcellular route, which occurs only in the duodenum, involves three steps. First, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cell across the apical membrane via TRPV6 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see p. 938). Second, the entering $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to several highaffinity binding proteins, particularly calbindin. These proteins, together with the exchangeable $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pools in the RER and mitochondria, effectively buffer the cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and maintain a favorable gradient for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry across the apical membrane of the enterocyte. Thus, the intestinal cell solves the problem of absorbing relatively large amounts of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ while keeping its free cytosolic $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ low. Third, the enterocyte extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the basolateral membrane by means of both a Ca pump and an Na-Ca exchanger.

Vitamin D promotes intestinal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption primarily by genomic effects that involve induction of the synthesis of epithelial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and pumps and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins, as well as other proteins (e.g., alkaline phosphatase).

The effect of PTH to stimulate intestinal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption is thought to be entirely indirect and mediated by PTH's action to increase the renal formation of 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D (see Fig. 52-8), which then enhances intestinal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption.

Vitamin D also stimulates phosphate absorption by the small intestine (see Fig. 52-10B). The initial step-as in the renal proximal tubule (see pp. 785-786)-is mediated by the NaPi cotransporter and appears to be rate limiting for transepithelial transport and subsequent delivery of phosphate to the circulation. 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D stimulates the synthesis of this transport protein and thus promotes phosphate entry into the mucosal cell.

Kidney In the kidney, vitamin D appears to act synergistically with PTH to enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the DCT (see p. 789). High-affinity $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins, similar to those found in the intestinal mucosa, have been specifically localized to this region of the kidney. It appears that PTH is a more potent regulator of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption than is vitamin D (see Fig. 52-8). Indeed, parathyroidectomy increases the fractional excretion of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and even high doses of vitamin D cannot correct this effect. In addition, as in the intestine, vitamin D promotes phosphate reabsorption in the kidney. The effects of vitamin D on phosphate reabsorption, like its effects on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, are less dramatic than those of PTH. Finally, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D directly inhibits the 1-hydroxylation of vitamin D , establishing a negativefeedback loop.

Bone The actions of vitamin D on bone are complex and are the result of both indirect and direct actions. The overall effect of vitamin D replacement in animals with diet-induced vitamin D deficiency is to increase the flux of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into bone. However, as we see below, the major effects of vitamin D on bone are indirect: the action of vitamin D on both the small intestine and the kidneys makes more $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ available to mineralize previously unmineralized osteoid. The direct effect of vitamin D on bone is via both osteoblasts and osteoclast precursor cells, both of which have VDRs. Vitamin D increases both osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation; when these activities are balanced, vitamin D simply increases bone turnover. However, when vitamin D is present in excess, it favors bone resorption because osteoblasts produce certain proteins with matrix-destroying properties (e.g., alkaline phosphatase, collagenase, plasminogen activator) as well as proteins that favor osteoclastogenesis (e.g., RANKL rather than OPG; see Fig. 52-4). Thus, because vitamin D can directly increase the number of mature osteoclasts, supplying vitamin D to bone obtained from vitamin D-deficient animals in in vitro experiments mobilizes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from bone into the medium. Additional evidence that vitamin D directly promotes bone resorption comes from experiments on rachitic animals who are maintained on a calcium-deficient diet. Treating these animals with vitamin D causes plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ to rise, an indication of net bone resorption. At the same time, however, the elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ promotes the mineralization of previously unmineralized osteoid-at the expense of bone resorption from other sites.

In summary, the antirachitic action of vitamin D is both indirect and direct. By enhancing the absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate from the intestine and by enhancing the

Figure 52-10 Intestinal absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate. A, The small intestine absorbs $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by two mechanisms. Passive paracellular absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ occurs throughout the small intestine. This pathway is the predominant one but is not under the control of vitamin D. The second mechanism-active transcellular absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-occurs only in the duodenum. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cell across the apical membrane via TRPV6 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Inside the cell, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is buffered by binding proteins, such as calbindin, and is also taken up into intracellular organelles, such as the ER. The enterocyte then extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the basolateral membrane via a Ca pump and an $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{Ca}$ exchanger. Thus, the net effect is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption. The active form of vitamin D-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D—stimulates all three steps of transcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption. B, Inorganic phosphate ( P ) enters the enterocyte across the apical membrane via an $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{P}$, cotransporter ( NaPi ). Once inside the cell, the P , is extruded across the basolateral membrane. Thus, the net effect is P , absorption.

reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate from the renal tubules, vitamin D raises the concentrations of both $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate in the blood and ECF. This increase in the $\mathrm{Ca} \times \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ion product, along with more differentiated osteoblasts, results-indirectly-in net bone mineralization. On the other hand, when vitamin D is in excess, the direct effect of vitamin D predominates, increasing bone mobilization.

## Calcium ingestion lowers-whereas phosphate ingestion raises-levels of both PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D

Calcium Ingestion When an individual ingests a meal containing calcium, the ensuing rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ inhibits PTH secretion. The decline in PTH causes a decrease in the resorption of Caprotein ${ }^{2+}$ and phosphorus from bone, thus limiting the postprandial increase in plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate levels. In addition, the decrease in PTH diminishes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the kidney and thus facilitates a calciuric response. If dietary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake remains high, the lower PTH will result in decreased 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, which will eventually diminish the fractional absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the GI tract.

If dietary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake is deficient, the body will attempt to restore $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ toward normal by increasing plasma [PTH]. This response will help to mobilize $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from bone, to promote renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ retention, and, over time, to increase the level of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, which will enhance gut absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

Phosphate Ingestion If one ingests phosphorus much in excess of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, the rise in plasma [phosphate] will increase the plasma $\mathrm{Ca} \times \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ion product, thereby promoting deposition of mineral in bone and lowering plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. The low plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, in turn, increases PTH secretion, provoking a phosphaturia and thus a fall of plasma [phosphate] toward normal. In addition, the PTH mobilizes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate from bone by its action. Over longer periods, the action of PTH to modulate the 1-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxyvitamin D plays an increasingly important role in defending the plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ by increasing intestinal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption.

The plasma [phosphate] is thus largely maintained indirectly through the actions of PTH in response to $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Another regulator of plasma [phosphate] is the protein fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23; see p. 787), secreted by osteocytes and osteoblasts in response to high plasma [phosphate]. FGF23 acts on the intestine to decrease phosphate absorption and on the kidney to limit phosphate reabsorption. Excessive FGF23 production causes an autosomal form of hereditary hypophosphatemia rickets by impairing bone mineralization, secondary to phosphate deficiency. Conversely, FGF23 deficiency can lead to hyperphosphatemia and ectopic calcification.

## CALCITONIN AND OTHER HORMONES

## Calcitonin inhibits osteoclasts, but its effects are transitory

Calcitonin is a 32 -amino-acid peptide hormone made by the clear or C cells of the thyroid gland. C cells (also called
parafollicular cells) are derived from neural crest cells of the fifth branchial pouch, which in humans migrate into the evolving thyroid gland. Although it is located within the thyroid, calcitonin's major, if not sole, biological action relates to the regulation of mineral metabolism and bone turnover. The incidental nature of its relationship with the major functions of the thyroid is emphasized by the finding that, in many nonhuman species, C cells are found in a body called the ultimobranchial gland and not in the thyroid at all.

Calcitonin is synthesized in the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35) by post-translational processing of a large procalcitonin. As illustrated in Figure 52-11, alternative splicing of the calcitonin gene product gives rise to several biologically active peptides. In the C cells, calcitonin is the only peptide made in biologically significant amounts. Within the central nervous system, calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) is the principal gene product, and it appears to act as a neurotransmitter in peptidergic neurons (see Table 13-1). Calcitonin is stored in secretory vesicles within the C cells, and its release is triggered by a rise in the extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ above normal. Conversely, a lowering of the extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ diminishes calcitonin secretion. The threshold $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ for enhancing calcitonin secretion is in the midphysiological range. In principle, this secretory profile would leave calcitonin well poised to regulate body $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ homeostasis.

The precise role of calcitonin in body $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ homeostasis has been difficult to define. This difficulty was first apparent from the simple clinical observation that, after complete thyroidectomy with removal of all calcitonin-secreting tissue, plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ remains normal (provided the parathyroid glands are not injured). Conversely, patients with a rare calcitonin-secreting tumor of the C cells frequently have plasma calcitonin concentrations that are 50 to 100 times normal, yet they maintain normal plasma levels of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, vitamin D, and PTH. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that calcitonin does have biologically important actions. First, although calcitonin appears to have a minimal role in the minute-to-minute regulation of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in humans, it does play an important role in many nonmammalian species. This role is particularly clear for teleost fish. The $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in seawater (and therefore in food) is relatively high, and calcitonin, secreted in response to a rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, decreases bone resorption, thus returning the plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ toward normal. Salmon calcitonin, which differs from human calcitonin in 14 of its 32 amino-acid residues, is roughly 10 -fold more potent on a molar basis in inhibiting human osteoclast function than is the human hormone.

The second line of evidence that calcitonin may have biologically important actions is the presence of calcitonin receptors. Like PTH receptors, the calcitonin receptor is a GPCR that, depending on the target cell, may activate either adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53) or phospholipase C (see pp. 53-56). Within bone, the osteoclast-which lacks PTH receptors-appears to be the principal target of calcitonin. Indeed, the presence of calcitonin receptors may be one of the most reliable methods of identifying osteoclasts. In the osteoclast, calcitonin raises [cAMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$, which activates effectors such as protein kinases. Calcitonin inhibits the resorptive activity of the osteoclast, thus slowing the rate of bone turnover. It also diminishes osteocytic osteolysis, and this actiontogether with its effect on the osteoclast-is responsible for

Figure 52-11 Synthesis of calcitonin and CGRP. A common primary RNA transcript gives rise to both calcitonin and CGRP. In the thyroid gland, C cells produce a mature mRNA that they translate to procalcitonin. They then process this precursor to produce an N-terminal peptide, calcitonin (a 32-amino-acid peptide), and calcitonin C-terminal peptide (CCP). In the brain, neurons produce a different mature mRNA and a different "pro" hormone. They process the peptide to produce an N-terminal peptide, CGRP, and a C-terminal peptide. AA, amino acids.
the hypocalcemic effect after the acute administration of pharmacological doses of calcitonin. The hypocalcemic action of calcitonin is particularly effective in circumstances in which bone turnover is accelerated, as occurs in rapidly growing young animals and in humans with hyperparathyroidism. The antiosteoclastic activity of calcitonin is also useful in treating Paget disease of bone (Box 52-3). However, within hours of exposure to high concentrations of calcitonin, osteoclasts desensitize. This "escape" from the hypocalcemic effect of calcitonin has limited the use of calcitonin in the clinical treatment of hypercalcemia. The transitory nature of the action of calcitonin appears to result, in part, from rapid downregulation of calcitonin receptors.

In the kidney, calcitonin, like PTH, causes a mild phosphaturia by inhibiting proximal-tubule phosphate transport. Calcitonin also causes a mild natriuresis and calciuresis. These actions may contribute to the acute hypocalcemic and hypophosphatemic actions of calcitonin. However, these renal effects are of short duration and do not appear
to be important in the overall renal handling of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, phosphate, or $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

## Sex steroid hormones promote bone deposition, whereas glucocorticoids promote resorption

Although PTH and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D are the principal hormones involved in modulating bone turnover, other hormones participate in this process. For example, the sex steroids testosterone and estradiol are needed for maintaining normal bone mass in males and females, respectively. The decline in estradiol that occurs postmenopausally exposes women to the risk of osteoporosis; that is, a decreased mass of both cortical and trabecular bone caused by a decrease in bone matrix (see Box 52-3). Osteoporosis is less common in men because their skeletal mass tends to be greater throughout adult life and because testosterone levels in men decline slowly with age, unlike the abrupt menopausal decline of estradiol in women.

# BOX 52-3 Osteoporosis 

Approximately 25 million Americans, mostly postmenopausal women, are affected by osteoporosis, and every year between 1 and 2 million of these individuals experience a fracture related to osteoporosis. The cost in economic and human terms is immense. Hip fractures are responsible for much of the morbidity associated with osteoporosis, but even more concerning is the observation that as many as $20 \%$ of women with osteoporotic hip fracture will die within 1 year of their fracture.

The major risk factor for osteoporosis is the postmenopausal decline in estrogen levels in aging women. Rarely, other endocrine disorders such as hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, androgen deficiency, and Cushing disease (hypercortisolism) are responsible. Other risk factors include inadequate dietary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake, alcoholism, cigarette smoking, and a sedentary lifestyle.

Strategies to prevent the development of osteoporosis begin in the premenopausal years. High $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake and a consistent program of weight-bearing exercises are widely recommended.

Pharmacological agents are now available for preventing or at least retarding the development of osteoporosis and for treating the disease once it has become established. These agents can be broadly classified into two groups: antiresorptive drugs and anabolic drugs that stimulate bone formation.

Among the antiresorptive drugs, estrogen is the most widely used. It is most effective when started at the onset of menopause, although it may offer benefits even in patients who are 20 or more years past menopause. However, possible increased risk of breast and endometrial cancer from postmenopausal estrogen limit use of this treatment. Another class of drugs-the
bisphosphonates-are effective inhibitors of bone resorption and have become a mainstay for the treatment of osteoporosis in both men and women. The newer bisphosphonates, which have a much greater potency, can be given either orally or as a once-a-year intravenous treatment.

Agents that can stimulate bone formation include vitamin D-often given as 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (calcitriol)—which is combined with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ therapy to increase the fractional absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and to stimulate the activity of osteoblasts. PTH is also now available as an injectable treatment for osteoporosis (see p. 1063), and when given intermittently, it potently stimulates osteoblast formation and increases bone mass. PTH also appears to decrease the rate of vertebral fractures. As mentioned on pages 1057-1058, denosumab-a monoclonal antibody to RANKL-is another antiresorptive therapy. It is also being used in some cases of bone resorption associated with metastatic disease. Now in clinical trials are agents that promote Wnt signaling by interfering with either sclerostin or dickkopf1; the hope is that these agents will have both prosynthetic and antiresorptive actions.

Calcitonin and the bisphosphonates have also been used successfully to treat Paget disease of bone, a disorder characterized by localized regions of bone resorption and reactive sclerosis. The level of bone turnover at sites of active Paget disease can be extremely high. Although it remains asymptomatic in many individuals, the disease can cause pain, deformity, fractures, and (if bony overgrowth occurs in the region of the eighth cranial nerve) vertigo and hearing loss. The cause of Paget disease is not known.

Glucocorticoids also modulate bone mass. This action is most evident in circumstances of glucocorticoid excess, which leads to osteoporosis, as suggested by the effects of glucocorticoids on the production of OPG (see pp. 10571058) and RANKL (see p. 1057).

The precise cellular mechanisms that mediate the action of androgens, estrogens, or glucocorticoids on bone have not been well defined. Despite the loss of bone that occurs with androgen or estrogen deficiency or glucocorticoid excess, in each case the coupling of bone synthesis to degradation is qualitatively preserved. Synthesis of new bone continues to occur at sites of previous bone resorption, and no excess of unmineralized osteoid is present. Presumably, the decline in bone mass reflects a quantitative shift in which the amount of new bone formed at any site is less than what was resorbed. Because this shift occurs at multiple sites, the result is a decline in overall bone mass.

## PTHrP, encoded by a gene that is entirely distinct from that for PTH, can cause hypercalcemia in certain malignancies

Unlike PTH, which is synthesized exclusively by the parathyroid gland, a peptide called PTH-related protein (PTHrP) is made in many different normal and malignant tissues. The PTH1R receptor (see p. 1061) in kidney and bone recognizes PTHrP with an affinity similar to that for intact PTH. PTHrP mimics each of the actions of PTH on kidney and bone. Thus, when present in sufficient concentrations, PTHrP causes hypercalcemia. PTHrP exists in three alternatively
spliced isoforms of a single gene product. The gene encoding PTHrP is completely distinct from that for PTH. The similar actions of PTHrP and PTH arise from homology within the first 13 amino acids of PTHrP and native PTH. Only weak homology exists between amino acids 14 and 34 (three amino acids are identical), and essentially none beyond amino acid 34 . This situation is an unusual example of mimicry among peptides that are structurally quite diverse.

The normal physiological roles of PTHrP are largely in regulating endochondral bone and mammary-gland development. The lactating breast also secretes PTHrP, and this hormone is present in very high concentrations in milk. PTHrP may promote the mobilization of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from maternal bone during milk production. In nonlactating humans, the plasma PTHrP concentration is very low, and PTHrP does not appear to be involved in the day-to-day regulation of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. It appears likely that under most circumstances, PTHrP acts in a paracrine or autocrine, rather than in an endocrine, regulatory fashion.

Many tumors are capable of manufacturing and secreting PTHrP, among them the following: squamous cell tumors of the lung, head, and neck; renal and bladder carcinomas; adenocarcinomas; and lymphomas. Patients with any of these tumors are subject to severe hypercalcemia of fairly abrupt onset. 0 N52-3

PTHrP was discovered at Yale University as the factor responsible for humeral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM). Andrew Stewart, Karl Insogna, Arthur Broadus, and their colleagues first demonstrated that this factor stimulates adenylyl cyclase activity. They later showed that this activity was inhibited by PTH antagonists and finally identified the 17-kDa protein.

# SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION 

Sam Mesiano and Ervin E. Jones

Reproduction is a fundamental process of life. All living organisms must reproduce either asexually (e.g., bacteria) or sexually (e.g., mammals). Asexual reproduction is highly efficient and produces large numbers of genetically identical offspring in a relative short amount of time. This strategy, however, is vulnerable to environmental changes because genetic and phenotypic variation between individual progeny is minimal and consequently the probability of producing progeny that have beneficial traits in a hostile environment is relatively low. In contrast, sexual reproduction is less efficient but produces progeny with markedly increased genetic and phenotypic variation, which increases the probability of producing individuals with characteristics that may be adaptive to environmental changes. In this context, natural selection favors sexual reproduction, and consequently most extant animals and flowering plants reproduce sexually.

In sexual reproduction a new individual is created by combining the genetic material of two individuals. Sexual reproduction involves the evolution of two sexually dissimilar individuals belonging to the same species, one male and one female, and each equipped with its own specific attributes necessary for its particular contribution to the process of procreation. Each sex produces its own type of sex cell or gamete, and the union of male and female gametes generates species-specific progeny. In addition, mechanisms-some simple, some complex-have evolved to ensure the proximity and union of the sex cells, known as syngamy. Thus, within each species, the relevant sexual characteristics of each partner have adapted differently to achieve the most efficient union of these progenitor cells. These differences between the sexes of one species are called sexual dimorphism. For example, oviparous species such as frogs release their eggs into a liquid medium only when they are in relative proximity to sperm. As effective as this approach is, it also typifies the wastefulness of reproduction among higher species inasmuch as most gametes go unfertilized.

Even among species that normally reproduce sexually, sexual dimorphism is not universal. For example, monoecious (i.e., hermaphroditic) species, such as cestodes and nematodes, have the capacity to produce both sperm and eggs. By definition, the ability to produce just one kind of gamete depends on sexually dimorphic differentiation.

Organisms that reproduce sexually normally have a single pair of sex chromosomes that are morphologically distinguishable from other chromosomes, the autosomes. Each of the sex chromosomes carries genetic information that determines the primary and secondary sexual characteristics
of an individual; that is, whether the individual functions and appears as male or female. It has become abundantly clear that genes determine sexual differentiation and sexual expression and, as a result, mechanisms and patterns of reproduction.

The sex of the gonad is genetically programmed: Will a female gonad (ovary) or a male gonad (testis) develop? Although germ cells of the early embryonic gonad are totipotent, these cells develop into female gametes or ova if the gonad becomes an ovary, but they develop into male gametes or sperm if the gonad becomes a testis. These two anatomically and functionally distinct gonads determine either "maleness" or "femaleness" and dictate the development of both primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Endocrine and paracrine modulators that are specific for either the ovary or the testis are primarily responsible for female or male sexual differentiation and behavior and therefore the individual's role in procreation.

## GENETIC ASPECTS OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

## Meiosis occurs only in germ cells and gives rise to male and female gametes

Gametes derive from a specialized lineage of embryonic cells-the germline-known as germ cells. They are the only cells that can divide by mitosis and meiosis and differentiate into sperm or ova. Germ cells are therefore the critical link between generations. The process by which cells decide between becoming somatic cells of the body or germ cells occurs in the early embryo and involves factors and processes that prevent the somatic fate and induce germline differentiation. Studies in experimental model systems are beginning to unravel the complex process of germline determination, which involves germline-specific transcription factors (see pp. 81-88) and small noncoding RNAs (see pp. 99-100) and DNA methylation (see pp. 95-96) to control expression of specific genes. The process by which germ cells develop into either sperm or ova is referred to as gametogenesis and involves meiosis.

Except for the gametes, all other nucleated cells in the human body-somatic cells-have a diploid number (2N) of chromosomes. Human diploid cells have 22 autosome pairs consisting of two homologous chromosomes, one contributed by the father and one by the mother. Diploid cells also contain a single pair of sex chromosomes comprising
