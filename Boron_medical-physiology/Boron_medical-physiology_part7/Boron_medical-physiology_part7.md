# ORGANIZATION OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

The kidneys serve three essential functions. First, they act as filters, removing metabolic products and toxins from the blood and excreting them through the urine. Second, they regulate the body's fluid status, electrolyte balance, and acidbase balance. Third, the kidneys produce or activate hormones that are involved in erythrogenesis, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ metabolism, and the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow.

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY

We begin this discussion with a macroscopic view and progress to the microscopic level as we describe the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that is repeated approximately 1 million times within each kidney.

## The kidneys are paired, retroperitoneal organs with vascular and epithelial elements

The human kidneys are paired, bean-shaped structures that lie behind the peritoneum on each side of the vertebral column (Fig. 33-1A). They extend from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the third lumbar vertebra. The two kidneys together comprise somewhat less than $0.5 \%$ of the total body weight; in men, each kidney weighs 125 to 170 g , whereas in women, each kidney weighs 115 to 155 g .

A fibrous, almost nondistensible capsule covers each kidney (see Fig. 33-1B). In the middle of the concave surface, a slit in the capsule-the hilus-serves as the port of entry for the renal artery and nerves and as the site of exit for the renal vein, the lymphatics, and the ureter. The hilus opens into a shallow space called the renal sinus, which is completely surrounded by renal parenchyma except where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. The renal sinus includes the urine-filled spaces: the renal pelvis proper and its extensions, the major and the minor calyces. Blood vessels and nerves also pass through the sinus. The renal capsule reflects into the sinus at the hilus so that its inner layers line the sinus, and the outer layers anchor to the blood vessels and renal pelvis.

A section of the kidney (see Fig. 33-1B) reveals two basic layers, the cortex (granular outer region) and the medulla (darker inner region). The granularity of the cortex results from the presence of glomeruli, microscopic tufts of capillaries, and a large number of highly convoluted epithelial structures in the form of tubules. The medulla lacks
glomeruli and consists of a parallel arrangement of tubules and small blood vessels.

The medulla is subdivided into 8 to 18 conical renal pyramids, whose bases face the cortical-medullary border; the tip of each pyramid terminates in the renal pelvis. At the tip of each pyramid are perforations, almost invisible to the naked eye, through which urine flows into the minor calyces of the renal sinus.

## The kidneys have a very high blood flow and glomerular capillaries flanked by afferent and efferent arterioles

Although the kidneys comprise $<0.5 \%$ of total body weight, they receive $\sim 20 \%$ of the cardiac output. This high blood flow provides the blood plasma necessary for forming an ultrafiltrate in the glomeruli. The renal circulation has a unique sequence of vascular elements: a high-resistance arteriole (the efferent arteriole), followed by a high-pressure glomerular capillary network for filtration, followed by a second high-resistance arteriole (the afferent arteriole), followed by a low-pressure capillary network that surrounds the renal tubules (peritubular capillaries) and takes up the fluid absorbed by these tubules.

The main features of the renal vascular system are illustrated in Figure 33-1B and C. A single renal artery enters the hilus and divides into anterior and posterior branches, which give rise to interlobar and then arcuate arteries. The latter arteries skirt the corticomedullary junction, where they branch into ascending interlobular arteries that enter the cortex and give rise to numerous afferent arterioles. These give rise to glomerular capillaries that rejoin to form efferent arterioles. For nephrons in the superficial portion of the cortex, the efferent arterioles are the origin of a dense peritubular capillary network that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the tubules in the cortex. The afferent and efferent arterioles determine the hydrostatic pressure in the interposed glomerular capillaries. The tone of both arterioles is under the control of a rich sympathetic innervation, as well as a wide variety of chemical mediators.

Very small branches of the arcuate artery, or the proximal portion of the interlobular artery, supply a subpopulation of "juxtamedullary" glomeruli that are located at or near the junction of cortex and medulla. The efferent arterioles of these nephrons descend into the renal papillae to form hairpin-shaped vessels called the vasa recta, which provide

capillary networks for tubules in the medulla. Some $90 \%$ of the blood entering the kidney perfuses superficial glomeruli and cortex; only $\sim 10 \%$ perfuses juxtamedullary glomeruli and medulla.

Lymph vessels, which drain the interstitial fluid of the cortex and may contain high concentrations of renal hormones such as erythropoietin, leave the kidney by following arteries toward the hilus. Lymphatics are absent from the renal medulla, where they would otherwise tend to drain the high-osmolality interstitial fluid, which is necessary for producing a concentrated urine (see pp. 809-817).

## The functional unit of the kidney is the nephron

Each kidney consists of 800,000 to 1,200,000 nephrons. Each nephron is an independent entity until the point at
which its initial collecting tubule merges with another tubule (Fig. 33-2).

A nephron consists of a glomerulus and a tubule. The glomerulus is a cluster of blood vessels from which the plasma filtrate originates. The tubule is an epithelial structure consisting of many subdivisions, designed to convert the filtrate into urine. These two entities-vascular and epithelial-meet at the blind end of the tubule epithelium, which is called Bowman's capsule or the glomerular capsule. This capsule surrounds the glomerulus and contains Bowman's space, which is contiguous with the lumen of the tubule. It is here that filtrate passes from the vascular system into the tubule system.

The remainder of the nephron consists of subdivisions of the tubule (see Fig. 33-2). The epithelial elements of the nephron include Bowman's capsule, the proximal tubule,

![bo0221257579](bo0221257579.jpg)

Figure 33-2 Structure of the nephron.
thin descending and thin ascending limbs of the loop of Henle, thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, distal convoluted tubule, and connecting tubule. The connecting tubule (C) N33-1 leads further into the initial collecting tubule, the cortical collecting tubule, and medullary collecting ducts.

Within the renal cortex, as noted above, one can distinguish two populations of nephrons (see Fig. 33-2). Superficial nephrons have short loops extending to the boundary between outer and inner medulla. Juxtamedullary nephrons, which play a special role in the production of a concentrated urine, have long loops that extend as far as the tip of the medulla.

## The renal corpuscle has three components: vascular elements, the mesangium, and Bowman's capsule and space

The renal corpuscle, the site of formation of the glomerular filtrate, comprises a glomerulus, Bowman's space, and Bowman's capsule.

During the development of the kidney, the interaction between the ureteric bud-which gives rise to the urinary system from the collecting duct to the ureters-and the surrounding loose mesenchyme (Fig. 33-3A) leads to the branching of the ureteric bud and condensation of the mesenchyme (see Fig. 33-3B). These condensed cells differentiate

The connecting tubule, initial collecting tubule, cortical collecting tubule, and medullary collecting duct all derive embryologically from the ureteric bud. Because the more proximal elements all derive embryologically from the metanephric blastema, the segments from the connecting tubule through the medullary collecting duct were treated in the past as an entity separate from the other components of the nephron. Today, the term nephron usually includes both the proximal segments and the collecting-duct system.

![bo0321257579](bo0321257579.jpg)

into an epithelium that forms a hollow, S-shaped tubular structure (see Fig. 33-3C) that gives rise to the nephron's tubular elements between Bowman's capsule and the connecting segment. The distal portion of the S-shaped tubular structure elongates and connects with branches of the developing ureteric bud (see Fig. 33-3D). At the same time, the blind proximal end of this S-shaped tubule closely attaches to the arterial vascular bundle that develops into the glomerular capillary tuft. Thinning of the epithelium on one circumference of the blind end of the S-shaped tubule leads to the emergence of the future parietal layer of Bowman's capsule. In contrast, the opposite visceral layer thickens and attaches to the glomerular capillaries (see Fig. 33-3D). These visceral epithelial cells later fold and develop into podocytes (see Fig. 33-3E).

In the mature kidney (see Fig. 33-3F), foot processes of the podocytes cover the glomerular capillaries. These podocytes, modified epithelial cells, thus represent the visceral layer of Bowman's capsule. Beginning at the vascular pole, the podocytes are continuous with the parietal layer of Bowman's capsule. Glomerular filtrate drains into the space between these two layers (Bowman's space) and flows into the proximal tubule at the urinary pole of the renal corpuscle.

The glomerular filtration barrier between the glomerular capillary lumen and Bowman's space comprises four elements with different functional properties (see Fig. 33-3G): (1) a glycocalyx covering the luminal surface of endothelial cells, (2) the endothelial cells, (3) the glomerular basement membrane, and (4) epithelial podocytes.

The glycocalyx consists of negatively charged glycosaminoglycans (GAGs; see p. 39) that may play a role in preventing leakage of large negatively charged macromolecules.

Endothelial cells of the glomerular capillaries are almost completely surrounded by the glomerular basement membrane and a layer of podocyte foot processes (Fig. 33-4). The exception is a small region toward the center of the glomerulus, where the endothelial cells have neither basement membrane nor podocytes and come into direct contact with mesangial cells, which resemble smooth muscle. Filtration occurs away from the mesangial cells, at the peripheral portion of the capillary wall, which is covered with basement membrane and podocytes. The endothelial cells contain large fenestrations, $70-\mathrm{nm}$ holes that provide no restriction to the movement of water and small solutesincluding proteins or other large molecules-out of the lumen of the capillary (Fig. 33-5). Thus, the endothelial cells probably serve only to limit the filtration of cellular elements (e.g., erythrocytes).

The basement membrane, located between endothelial cells and podocyte foot processes (see Fig. 33-3G), separates the endothelial layer from the epithelial layer in all parts of the glomerular tuft. The basement membrane itself has three layers (see Fig. 33-3H): (1) an inner thin layer (lamina rara interna); (2) a thick layer (lamina densa), and (3) an outer thin layer (lamina rara externa). The basement membrane makes an important contribution to the permeability characteristics of the filtration barrier by restricting intermediatesized to large solutes (molecular weight $>1 \mathrm{kDa}$ ). Because the basement membrane contains heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), it especially restricts large, negatively charged solutes (see Fig. 34-4A).

The outer surfaces of the capillary endothelial cells are covered by a layer of interdigitating foot processes of the podocytes. The podocyte cell body links to the foot processes by leg-like primary and secondary processes.

Figure 33-5 Inner aspect of glomerular capillary, showing fenestrations of endothelial cells. This scanning electron micrograph shows a view of the glomerular capillary wall from the vantage point of the capillary lumen. Multiple fenestrations, each $\sim 70 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter, perforate the endothelial cells.

Podocytes have foot interdigitating processes that cover the basement membrane (see Fig. 33-4). Between these interdigitations (the nose-like structures in Fig. 33-3H) are filtration slits (see Fig. 33-3H); the interdigitations are connected by thin diaphragmatic structures-the slit diaphragms-with pores ranging in size from 4 to 14 nm . Glycoproteins with negative charges cover the podocyte bodies, the interdigitations, and the slit diaphragms. These negative charges contribute to the restriction of filtration of large anions (Fig. 34-4A). The extracellular domains of the integral membrane proteins nephrin and NEPH1 from adjacent podocytes appear to zip together to help form the slit diaphragm. Podocin and other proteins also contribute to the slit diaphragm (see Fig. 33-3f). Phosphotyrosine motifs on the intracellular domains of some of these proteins may recruit other molecules involved in signaling events that control slit permeability. Genetic defects in any of several of these protein can make the filtration barrier leaky, leading to the appearance of large proteins (e.g., albumin) in the urinenephrotic syndrome. For example, the genetic absence of nephrin leads to congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type, characterized by severe proteinuria. ( $\mathrm{N33-2}$

Supporting the glomerular capillary loops is a network of contractile mesangial cells, which secrete the extracellular matrix. This network is continuous with the smoothmuscle cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles. The matrix extends to the "extraglomerular" mesangial cells (see Fig. 33-3F). The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA) includes the extraglomerular mesangial cells, the macula densa, and the granular cells. The macula densa (from the Latin macula [spot] + densa [dense]) is a patch of specialized tubule epithelial cells-at the transition between the TAL and the distal tubule-that contacts its own glomerulus (see Fig. 33-3F). These cells have strikingly large nuclei and are closely packed, and thus they have a plaque-like appearance. The granular cells in the wall of afferent arterioles, also called juxtaglomerular or epithelioid cells, are specialized smoothmuscle cells that produce, store, and release the enzyme renin (see p. 841). The JGA is part of a complex feedback mechanism that regulates renal blood flow and filtration rate (see pp. 750-751), and it also indirectly modulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ balance (see pp. 841-842) and systemic blood pressure (see pp. 554-555).

## The tubule components of the nephron include the proximal tubule, loop of Henle, distal tubule, and collecting duct

Figure 33-6 illustrates the ultrastructure of the cells of the different tubule segments. Table 33-1 lists these segments and their abbreviations. ( $\mathrm{N33-3}$ Based on its appearance at low magnification, the proximal tubule can be divided into the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT; Fig. 33-6A), and the proximal straight tubule (PST; see Fig. 33-6B). However, based on ultrastructure, the proximal tubule can alternatively be subdivided into three segments: S1, S2, and S3. The S1 segment starts at the glomerulus and includes the first portion of the PCT. The S2 segment starts in the second half of the PCT and continues into the first half of the PST. Finally, the S3 segment includes the distal half of the PST that extends into the medulla.

TABLE 33-1 Tubule Segments of the Nephron

| TUBULE SEGMENT | ABBREVIATION |
| :-- | :-- |
| Proximal convoluted tubule | PCT |
| Proximal straight tubule | PST |
| Thin descending limb of loop of Henle | tDLH |
| Thin ascending limb of loop of Henle | tALH |
| Thick ascending limb of loop of Henle | TAL |
| Distal convoluted tubule | DCT |
| Connecting tubule | CNT |

Both the apical (luminal) and basolateral (peritubular) membranes of proximal-tubule cells are extensively amplified (see Fig. 33-6A, B). The apical membrane has infoldings in the form of a well-developed brush border. This enlargement of the apical surface area correlates with the main function of this nephron segment; namely, to reabsorb the bulk of the filtered fluid back into the circulation. A central cilium, which may play a role in sensing fluid flow, protrudes from the apical pole of proximal-tubule cells and nearly all the other types of tubule cells.

The basolateral membranes of adjacent proximal-tubule cells form numerous interdigitations, bringing abundant mitochondria in close contact with the plasma membrane. The interdigitations of the lateral membranes also form an extensive extracellular compartment bounded by the tight junctions at one end and by the basement membrane of the epithelium at the other end. Proximal-tubule cells contain lysosomes, endocytic vacuoles, and a well-developed endoplasmic reticulum. Proximal-tubule cells also have a prominent Golgi apparatus (see p. 21), which is important for synthesizing many membrane components, sorting them, and targeting them to specific surface sites. From the S1 to the S3 segments, cell complexity progressively declines, correlating with a gradual decrease of reabsorptive rates along the tubule. Thus, the cells exhibit a progressively less developed brush border, diminished complexity of lateral cell interdigitations, a lower basolateral cell membrane area, and a decrease in the number of mitochondria.

In comparison with the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, the cells lining the thin descending limb (tDLH) and thin ascending limb (tALH) of the loop of Henle are far less complex (see Fig. 33-6C, D), with few mitochondria and little cell membrane amplification. In superficial nephrons, the thin ascending limbs are extremely abbreviated (see Fig. 33-2). However, they form a major part of the long loops of the juxtamedullary nephrons.

Epithelial cells lining the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), which terminates at the macula densa, are characterized by tall interdigitations and numerous mitochondria within extensively invaginated basolateral membranes (see Fig. 33-6E). This complex cell machinery

## N33-2 Finnish-Type Nephrosis

A critical protein in slit diaphragm is nephrin, a protein specifically located at the slit diaphragm of glomerular podocytes. Nephrin plays an essential role in the maintenance of normal glomerular permeability because its absence leads to severe proteinuria. Thus, a rare human autosomal disease characterized by absence of nephrin (Finnish-type nephrosis with massive albuminuria) further supports the critical role of slitdiaphragm proteins in defining glomerular permeability to macromolecules. Figure 33-3 provides a view of glomerular filtration slits and includes slit-diaphragm proteins of functional importance. It is likely that changes in phosphorylation of podocyte proteins modulate the permeability properties of the slit membrane to proteins.

## N33-3 Tubule Segments of the Nephron

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

In Figure 33-6, we identified 11 distinct segments (lettered $A$ through $K$ ) in the nephron. The following is a description of the cells that make up each of these segments.
A. Proximal convoluted tubule (PCT). The first portion of the PCT consists of S1 cells, and the latter portion of S2 cells. Both cells have abundant apical microvilli and a deeply infolded basolateral membrane. They also have a rich supply of mitochondria, which lie between the infoldings. These complexities diminish from the S1 to the S2 segments.
B. Proximal straight tubule (PST). The first portion of the PST consists of S2 cells, and the latter portion of S3 cells. The ultrastructural complexity diminishes from the S2 to the S3 segments.
C. Thin descending limb (tDLH). The cells are less complex and flatter than those of the S3 segment of the proximal tubule.
D. Thin ascending limb (tALH). Away from the nucleus, the cells are even thinner than those of the descending limb.
E. Thick ascending limb (TAL). The cells, which lack microvilli, are substantially taller and more complex than those of the thin limbs.
F. Distal convoluted tubule (DCT). The cells are very similar to those of the TAL.
G. Connecting tubule (CNT). This segment consists of both connecting-tubule cells, which secrete kallikrein, and intercalated cells, which are rich in mitochondria.
H. Initial collecting tubule (ICT). The ICT is defined as the segment just before the first confluence of tubules. About one third of the cells in this segment are intercalated cells, and the rest are principal cells.
I. Cortical collecting tubule (CCT). The CCT is defined as the segment after the first confluence of tubules. The cells in this segment are very similar to those in the ICT.
J. Outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD). The principal cells in this nephron segment have a modest cell height. The number of intercalated cells progressively decreases along the length of this segment.
K. Inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD). This segment consists only of principal cells. Even at the beginning of the IMCD, the principal cells are taller than in the OMCD. At the end of the IMCD, the "papillary" collecting-duct cells are extremely tall.

Figure 33-6 Structure of tubule cells along the nephron. Because of the wide range of tubule diameters along the nephron, the scaling factors for tubule cross sections differ for panels $\mathbf{A}$ to $\mathbf{K}$. However, the individual cells next to the tubule cross sections are drawn to the same scale.

correlates with the key role these cells play in making the medullary interstitium hyperosmotic.

Until the latter part of the 20th century, morphologists defined the classic distal tubule-on the basis of light microscopic studies-as the nephron segment stretching from the macula densa to the first confluence of two nephrons in the collecting-duct system. Today, we subdivide the classic distal tubule into three segments, based on ultrastructural studies: the distal convoluted tubule (starting at the macula densa), the connecting tubule, and the initial collecting tubule. What was classically termed the early distal tubule is mainly the distal convoluted tubule, whereas the classically termed late distal tubule is mainly the initial collecting tubule.

The distal convoluted tubule (DCT) begins at the macula densa and ends at the transition to the connecting tubule (see Fig. 33-6F). The cells of the DCT are similar in structure to those of the thick ascending limb. However, significant cell heterogeneity characterizes the tubule segments that follow.

The connecting tubule (CNT), which ends at the transition to the initial collecting tubule, consists of two cell types: CNT cells and intercalated cells. CNT cells (see Fig. 33-6G) are unique in that they produce and release renal kallikrein, a serine protease-attached to the apical membrane-that modulates apical membrane channels and transporters. We discuss intercalated cells below.

The two segments following the CNT, the initial collecting tubule (ICT, up to the first confluence) and the cortical collecting tubule (CCT, after the confluence), are identical. They are composed of intercalated and principal cells, which exhibit striking morphological and functional differences. Intercalated cells, similar in structure to the intercalated cells of the CNT, make up about one third of the lining of these collecting-tubule segments (see Fig. 33-6H, l). They are unusual among tubule cells in that they lack a central cilium. One subpopulation of these cells (A- or $\alpha$-intercalated cells) secretes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and reabsorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, whereas another ( B - or $\beta$-intercalated cells) secretes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Principal cells make up about two thirds of the cells of the ICT and CCT (see Fig. $33-6 H, l)$. Compared with intercalated cells, principal cells have fewer mitochondria, only modestly developed invaginations of the basolateral membrane, and a central cilium on the apical membrane. Principal cells reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

The medullary collecting duct is lined mostly by one cell type that increases in cell height toward the papilla (see Fig. 33-6J, K). The number of intercalated cells diminishes beginning at the outer medullary collecting duct. Cells in this segment continue the transport of electrolytes and participate in the hormonally regulated transport of water and of urea. At the extreme end of the medullary collecting duct (i.e., the "papillary" collecting duct or duct of Bellini), the cells are extremely tall.

## The tightness of tubule epithelia increases from the proximal to the medullary collecting tubule

Epithelia may be either "tight" or "leaky," depending on the permeability of their tight junctions (see pp. 136-137). In general, the tightness of the tubule epithelium increases from
the proximal tubule to the collecting duct. In the leaky proximal tubule, junctional complexes are shallow and, in freezefracture studies, show only a few strands of membrane proteins (see pp. 43-44). In contrast, in the relatively tight collecting tubule, tight junctions extend deep into the intercellular space and consist of multiple strands of membrane proteins. Tubule segments with tight junctions consisting of only one strand have low electrical resistance and high solute permeability, whereas tubules with several strands tend to have high electrical resistance and low permeability.

Gap junctions (see pp. 158-161) provide low-resistance pathways between some, but not all, neighboring tubule cells. These gap junctions are located at various sites along the lateral cell membranes. Electrical coupling exists among proximal-tubule cells, but not among heterogenous cell types, such as those found in the connecting and collecting tubules.

## MAIN ELEMENTS OF RENAL FUNCTION

## The nephron forms an ultrafiltrate of the blood plasma and then selectively reabsorbs the tubule fluid or secretes solutes into it

As they do for capillaries elsewhere in the body, Starling forces (see pp. 467-468) govern the flow of fluid across the capillary walls in the glomerulus and result in net filtration. However, in the case of the glomerular capillaries, the filtrate flows not into the interstitium, but into Bowman's space, which is contiguous with the lumen of the proximal tubule.

The main function of renal tubules is to recover most of the fluid and solutes filtered at the glomerulus. If the fluid were not recovered, the kidney would excrete the volume of the entire blood plasma in less than half an hour. The retrieval of the largest fraction of glomerular filtrate occurs in the proximal tubule, which reabsorbs $\mathrm{NaCl}, \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, filtered nutrients (e.g., glucose and amino acids), divalent ions (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ ), and water. Finally, the proximal tubule secretes $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and a variety of endogenous and exogenous solutes into the lumen.

The main function of the loop of Henle-tDLH, tALH, and TAL-is to participate in forming concentrated or dilute urine. The loop does this by pumping NaCl into the interstitium of the medulla without appreciable water flow, thus making the interstitium hypertonic. Downstream, the medullary collecting duct exploits this hypertonicity by either permitting or not permitting water to flow by osmosis into the hypertonic interstitium. In humans, only $\sim 15 \%$ of the nephrons, the juxtamedullary nephrons, have long loops that descend to the tip of the papilla. Nevertheless, this subpopulation of nephrons (see Fig. 33-2) is extremely important for creating the osmotic gradients within the papilla that allow water movement out of the lumen of the entire population of medullary collecting ducts. As a result of this water movement, urine osmolality in the collecting ducts can far exceed that in the plasma.

TAL cells secrete the Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP), also known as uromodulin. (3) N33-4 Normal subjects excrete 30 to $50 \mathrm{mg} /$ day into the urine, which-along with albumin ( $<20 \mathrm{mg} /$ day $)$-accounts for most of the protein normally present in urine. THP adheres to certain strains of

# N33-4 Tamm-Horsfall Protein 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

The Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP)—also known as uromodulin-is the soluble cleavage product of an abundant glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein (see p. 13) on the apical membrane of the TAL cells. THP, normally the most abundant protein in the urine, may play a role in the defense against pathogenic bacteria in the genitourinary system.

Escherichia coli and may be part of the innate defense against urinary tract infections. This protein may also have a role in reducing aggregation of calcium crystals and thereby preventing formation of kidney stones. THP also constitutes the matrix of urinary casts. A cast is cylindrical debris in the urine that has taken the shape of the tubule lumen in which it was formed.

The classic distal tubule and the collecting-duct system perform the fine control of salt and water excretion. Although only small fractions of the glomerular filtrate reach these most distally located nephron sites, these tubule segments are where several hormones (e.g., aldosterone, arginine vasopressin) exert their main effects on electrolyte and water excretion.

## The JGA is a region where each thick ascending limb contacts its glomerulus

Elements of the JGA play two important regulatory roles. First, if the amount of fluid and NaCl reaching a nephron's macula densa (see Fig. 33-3F) increases, the glomerular filtration rate (see p. 732) of that nephron falls. We discuss this phenomenon of tubuloglomerular feedback on pages $750-751$.

The second regulatory mechanism comes into play during a decrease in the pressure of the renal artery feeding the various afferent arterioles. When the baroreceptor (see p. 841) in the afferent arteriole senses decreased stretch in the arteriole wall, it directs neighboring granular cells to increase their release of renin into the general circulation. We discuss the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, which is important in the long-term control of systemic arterial blood pressure, on pages 841-842.

## Sympathetic nerve fibers to the kidney regulate renal blood flow, glomerular filtration, and tubule reabsorption

The autonomic innervation to the kidneys is entirely sympathetic; the kidneys lack parasympathetic nerve fibers. The sympathetic supply to the kidneys originates from the celiac plexus (see Fig. 14-3) and generally follows the arterial vessels into the kidney. The varicosities of the sympathetic fibers release norepinephrine and dopamine into the loose connective tissue near the smooth-muscle cells of the vasculature (i.e., renal artery as well as afferent and efferent arterioles) and near the proximal tubules. Sympathetic stimulation to the kidneys has three major effects. First, the catecholamines cause vasoconstriction. Second, the catecholamines strongly enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by proximaltubule cells. Third, as a result of the dense accumulation of sympathetic fibers near the granular cells of the JGA, increased sympathetic nerve activity dramatically stimulates renin secretion.

Renal nerves also include afferent (i.e., sensory) fibers. A few myelinated nerve fibers conduct baroreceptor and chemoreceptor impulses that originate in the kidney. Increased perfusion pressure stimulates renal baroreceptors in the interlobular arteries and afferent arterioles. Renal ischemia and abnormal ion composition of the interstitial fluid stimulate chemoreceptors located in the renal pelvis. These pelvic
chemoreceptors probably respond to high extracellular levels of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and may elicit changes in capillary blood flow.

## The kidneys, as endocrine organs, produce renin, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, erythropoietin, prostaglandins, and bradykinin

Besides renin production by the JGA granular cells (see p. 841), the kidneys play several other endocrine roles. Proximal-tubule cells convert circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D to the active metabolite, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D. This hormone controls $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphorus metabolism by acting on the intestines, kidneys, and bone (see p. 1064), and is important for developing and maintaining bone structure.

Fibroblast-like cells in the interstitium of the cortex and outer medulla secrete erythropoietin (EPO) in response to a fall in the local tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see pp. 431-433). EPO stimulates the development of red blood cells by action on hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow. (5) N18-2 In chronic renal failure, the deficiency of EPO leads to severe anemia that can be treated with recombinant EPO.

The kidney releases prostaglandins and several kinins, paracrine agents that control circulation within the kidney. These substances are generally vasodilators and may play a protective role when renal blood flow is compromised. Tubule cells also secrete angiotensin, bradykinin, cAMP, and ATP into the lumen, which can modulate downstream nephron function.

## MEASURING RENAL CLEARANCE AND TRANSPORT

Numerous tests can assess renal function. Some are applicable only in animal experiments. (5) N33-5 Others are useful in clinical settings and fall into two general categories:

1. Modern imaging techniques provide outstanding macroscopic views of renal blood flow, filtration, and excretory function.
2. Measurements of so-called renal clearance of various substances evaluate the ability of the kidneys to handle solutes and water.

This subchapter focuses on clearance measurements, which compare the rate at which the glomeruli filter a substance (water or a solute) with the rate at which the kidneys excrete it into the urine. By measuring the difference between the amounts filtered and excreted for a particular substance, we can estimate the net amount reabsorbed or secreted by the renal tubules and can thus gain insight into the three basic functions of the kidney: glomerular filtration, tubule reabsorption, and tubule secretion. Although widely used, clearance methods have the inherent limitation that they measure overall nephron function. This function is "overall" in two different senses. First, clearance sums many individual transport operations occurring sequentially along a nephron. Second, clearance sums the output of all 2 million nephrons in parallel. Hence, clearance cannot provide information on precise sites and mechanisms of transport. Such information can, however, come from studies of individual nephrons, tubule cells, or cell membranes. One can

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

Clearance methods treat the whole kidney as a "black box." Thus, using clearance methods, it is very difficult to determine which nephron segments are responsible for which transport processes. It is also impossible to determine which nephrons are responsible for overall urinary excretion. To learn how single nephrons function, and also to understand how individual segments of the nephron contribute to overall nephron function, renal physiologists have developed a series of invasive techniques for studying the function of renal cells in the research laboratory.

## Free-Flow Micropuncture

It is possible, under microscopic observation, to insert a sharpened micropipette into tubule segments at or near the surface of the kidney or into exposed parts of the renal papilla. In these cases, one can collect fluid from identified tubule segments, as illustrated in Figure 33-9A for a superficially located proximal tubule. The investigator collects tubule fluid at a rate that is comparable to the flow rate in the undisturbed nephron and then analyzes this fluid for the solute of interest.

## Stationary or Stopped-Flow Microperfusion

In the stationary or stopped-flow microperfusion approach, the investigator deposits an aqueous solution between two oil columns inside the tubule lumen and periodically withdraws samples for analysis (see Fig. 33-9B). An advantage of this technique is that one can choose the initial composition of the fluid deposited in the lumen.

## Continuous Microperfusion

The continuous microperfusion approach is similar to the stationary approach described above in that a pair of oil blocks isolate the artificial perfusion fluid from the tubule fluid normally present (see Fig. 33-9C). A difference is that one continuously infuses fluid by means of a carefully calibrated microperfusion pump and then collects the perfusate in a micropipette located at the distal end of the perfused tubule segment. In addition, it is possible to perfuse the peritubular capillary network by means of separate micropipettes. This approach permits one to evaluate the effects of changes in the peritubular environment on tubule transport. The simultaneous perfusion of the lumen and peritubular capillaries affords excellent control over the environment of the tubule cells at both the apical and basolateral surfaces.

## Perfusion of Isolated Tubules

It is possible to microdissect a single segment from almost any part of the nephron and perfuse the single isolated tubule on the stage of a microscope (see Fig. 33-9D). The isolated perfused tubule technique offers two distinct advantages over the in vivo micropuncture and microperfusion techniques discussed above.

First, one can study tubules from any segment of the nephron, not just superficial tubule segments. Second, the tubules can be isolated from nephron populations (juxtamedullary as well as superficial) located anywhere in the kidney. This consideration is important because of the heterogeneity that exists among nephrons. Thus, the isolated perfused tubule technique offers the ultimate in control over the environment of tubule cells.

In addition to the above four preparations, which permit one to study a defined tubule segment from a single nephron, several other preparations are available for studying cellular and subcellular events. This more narrowly focused approach is achieved at the expense of disrupting the normal tubule and vascular organization of the kidney.

## Suspensions of Tubules or Single Cells

Suspensions of tubules or single cells have enough cell mass to permit the determination of cellular metabolism under a variety of experimental conditions. Although this approach can also be used to study solute transport, a disadvantage is that, because the cells have lost their normal polarity, it is impossible to assign function to either the apical or basolateral membranes.

## Tubule Cells in Culture

A preparation of tubule cells in culture offers the advantage of preserving the sidedness of the apical and basolateral membranes. On the other hand, one must be aware that cells in culture-whether primary cultures or continuous cell linesmay acquire a phenotype different from that of tubule cells in vivo.

## Membrane Vesicles

A membrane vesicle preparation is an extension of the single-cell suspension technique but takes the isolation a step further. When one disrupts tubule cells, the fragments of their plasma membranes spontaneously take the form of membrane vesiclessmall, irregularly shaped volumes that are completely surrounded by a piece of cell membrane, complete with its lipids and proteins. It is possible to purify membrane vesicles into fractions that consist mainly of luminal ("brush-border") cell membranes or basolateral cell membranes. These vesicles maintain many of the transport functions of tubule cells in vivo and can be examined in ways that allow one to study specific transport systems in vesicles derived primarily from the apical versus basolateral membrane (see Fig. 5-12). Two important caveats regarding this method should be recognized. First, vesicles may exhibit large variations in their passive leakiness via pathways that are not normally present in tubule cells in vivo. Second, many of the normal cytoplasmic constituents are absent from the vesicle preparation, so that signal-transduction mechanisms may not function normally.

also apply the clearance concept to other problems, such as clearance of bile by the liver (see p. 963) or clearance of hormones from the blood (see p. 1021).

## The clearance of a solute is the virtual volume of plasma that would be totally cleared of a solute in a given time

All solutes excreted into the urine ultimately come from the blood plasma perfusing the kidneys. Thus, the rate at which the kidney excretes a solute into the urine equals the rate at which the solute disappears from the plasma, provided the kidney does not produce, consume, or store the solute. Imagine that, in 1 minute, 700 mL of plasma flow through the kidneys. This plasma contains $0.7 \mathrm{~L} \times 142 \mathrm{mM}$ or $\sim 100 \mathrm{mmol}$ of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Of this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the kidneys remove and excrete into the urine only a tiny amount, $\sim 0.14 \mathrm{mmol}$. In principle, these 0.14 mmol of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$could have come from only 1 mL of plasma, had all $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions been removed (i.e., cleared) from this volume. The clearance of a solute is defined as the virtual volume of blood plasma (per unit time) needed to supply the amount of solute that appears in the urine. Thus, in our example, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$clearance was $1 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, even though 700 mL of plasma flowed through the kidneys.

Renal clearance methods are based on the principle of mass balance and the special anatomy of the kidney (Fig. 33-7). For any solute ( X ) that the kidney does not synthesize, degrade, or accumulate, the only route of entry to the kidney is the renal artery, and the only two routes of exit are the

Figure 33-7 Solute mass balance in the kidney.
renal vein and the ureter. Because the input of X equals the output of X ,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\text { Arterial input of } \mathrm{X}}{\frac{\text { mmoole }}{\mathrm{mL}}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{~min}}}=\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{~s}}}{\frac{\text { mmoole }}{\mathrm{mL}}}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{s}}}{\frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{~min}}}+\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\frac{\text { mmoole }}{\mathrm{mL}}}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{V}}{\frac{\mathrm{mL}}{\mathrm{~min}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{s}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{s}}$ are plasma concentrations of X in the renal artery and renal vein, respectively. $\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{s}}$ are rates of renal plasma flow (RPF) in the renal artery and vein, respectively. $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the concentration of X in urine. V is urine flow (the overdot represents the time derivative of volume). The product $U_{X} \cdot \dot{V}$ is the urinary excretion rate, the amount of X excreted in urine per unit time.

In developing the concept of renal clearance, we transform Equation 33-1 in two ways, both based on the assumption that the kidneys clear all X from an incoming volume of arterial plasma. First, we replace $\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{s}}$ with the inflow of the virtual volume-the clearance of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$-that provides just that amount of X that appears in the urine. Second, we assign the virtual venous output a value of zero. Thus, Equation 33-1 becomes

Solving for clearance yields

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}}
$$

This is the classic clearance equation that describes the virtual volume of plasma that would be totally cleared of a solute in a given time (Table 33-2, section A). (○) N33-6 We need to know only three parameters to compute the clearance of a solute X :

1. The concentration of X in the urine $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$
2. The volume of urine formed in a given time $(\dot{\mathrm{V}})$
3. The concentration of X in systemic blood plasma $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$, which is the same as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{s}}$ in Equation 33-1

Together, the three basic functions of the kidneyglomerular filtration, tubule reabsorption, and tubule secretion-determine the renal clearance of a solute. In the special case in which the kidneys completely clear X from

$$

$C_{X}$ may vary between zero, for a substance that does not appear in the urine (e.g., glucose), and $\sim 700 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ (i.e., total RPF) for a substance (e.g., PAH) that is totally removed from the blood in a single pass through the kidney.

# N33-6 Symbols of the Clearance Equation 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager, Gerhard Giebisch, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

In Equation 33-3, we present the clearance equation* as

$$
C_{X}=\frac{U_{X} \cdot \dot{V}}{P_{X}}
$$

Here C is the clearance, X is the solute, $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the concentration of X in the urine, V is the flow of urine (volume per unit time), and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the concentration of X in the plasma. Most clinical texts replace the symbol $\dot{V}$ simply with $V$. We use $V$ to distinguish an absolute volume of urine from the rate of urine production.

This use of symbols is very different from elsewhere in the text and, indeed, from elsewhere in the discipline of physiology. A cellular physiologist might write the same equation in the form

$$
C_{X}=\frac{[X]_{\text {Urine }} \cdot \dot{V}}{[X]_{\text {Plasma }}}
$$

Indeed, an advantage of writing the clearance equation in its totally unofficial form (Equation NE 33-2) is that it avoids confusing $P_{X}$ with the standard symbol for the permeability to X .

[^0]
[^0]:    *The following mnemonic is attributed to John M. Russell: Imagine that you are in Brussels on a sunny day, gazing at the famous fountain that features the statue of a little boy urinating into a pool of water. The sunlight (which contains ultraviolet or "UV" rays) is obviously above the stream of urine ("pee") ... yielding "UV over P."

plasma during a single passage through the kidneys $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}, \mathrm{s}}=0\right.$ in Equation 33-1), the renal clearance of X equals $\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{x}}$ in Equation 33-1. Because para-aminohippurate (PAH) is just such a special solute, its clearance is a good estimate of $\mathrm{RPF}_{\mathrm{x}}$, which we simplify to RPF (see Table 33-2, section B). We discuss RPF on pages 749-750.

For all solutes that do not behave like PAH, the renal venous plasma still contains some X . Thus, the virtual volume cleared of X in a given time is less than the total RPF. For most solutes, then, clearance describes a virtual volume of plasma that would be totally cleared of a solute, whereas in reality a much larger volume of plasma is partially cleared of the solute.

We can use a clearance approach to estimate another important renal parameter: glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is the volume of fluid filtered into Bowman's capsule per unit time. Imagine a solute X that fulfills two criteria. First, X is freely filtered (i.e., concentration of X in Bowman's space is the same as that in blood plasma). Second, the tubules do not absorb, secrete, synthesize, degrade, or accumulate X. Thus, the amount of X that appears in the urine per unit time $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ is the same as the amount of X that the glomerulus filters per unit time $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \mathrm{GFR}\right)$ :

$$
\frac{\text { Input to }}{\text { Bowman's space }} \quad \frac{\text { Output into }}{\text { urine }} \text { urine }
$$

The input to Bowman's space is also known as the filtered solute load and is generally given in $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$ (or $\mathrm{mg} /$ min ). Rearranging Equation 33-4, we have

$$
\mathrm{GFR}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}}
$$

Equation 33-5 is in exactly the same form as the classic clearance equation (see Equation 33-3). In other words, GFR is $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}$ if X has the required properties. As discussed on pages 739-741, inulin is just such a solute (see Table 33-2, section C).

## A solute's urinary excretion is the algebraic sum of its filtered load, reabsorption by tubules, and secretion by tubules

The homeostasis of body fluids critically depends on the ability of the kidneys to determine the amount of a given solute that they excrete into the urine. Renal excretion rate $\left(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ depends on three factors (Fig. 33-8):

1. The rate of filtration of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$, known as the filtered load $\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{X}}=\mathrm{GFR} \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$
2. The rate of reabsorption of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ by the tubules
3. The rate of secretion of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ by the tubules

This interrelationship is expressed quantitatively by

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Amount } \begin{array}{c}
\text { Amount } \\
\text { excreted } \\
\text { per unit } \\
\text { time }
\end{array} \text { of } \begin{array}{c}
\text { Amount } \\
\text { reabsorbed } \\
\text { per unit } \\
\text { time }
\end{array} \text { of } \begin{array}{c}
\text { Amount } \\
\text { secreted } \\
\text { per unit } \\
\text { time }
\end{array} \\
& \overline{\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{X}}}=\overline{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{X}}}-\overline{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{X}}}+\overline{\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{X}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

For some substances (e.g., inulin), no reabsorption or secretion occurs. For most substances, either reabsorption or
![bo0821257579](bo0821257579.jpg)

Figure 33-8 Factors contributing to the net urinary excretion of a substance.
secretion determines the amount present in the final urine. However, for some substances, both reabsorption and secretion determine excretion.

If a solute is only reabsorbed, but not secreted, we can rearrange Equation 33-6 to obtain the rate of reabsorption:

$$
\frac{\text { Reabsorption rate }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{\text { Filtered load }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{\text { Excretion rate }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})}{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})} \quad \frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})}{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})}
$$

Conversely, if a solute is only secreted, but not reabsorbed, the rate of secretion is

$$
\frac{\text { Secretion rate }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{\text { Excretion rate }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{\text { Filtered rate }}{\left(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}\right)} \quad \frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})}{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min})}
$$

In applying Equations 33-7 and 33-8, we must keep in mind two important limitations. First, to estimate the rate at which a substance appears in the filtrate-the filtered loadfrom the product GFR $\cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}$, we assume that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the freely filterable concentration of X . Indeed, many substances (particularly univalent electrolytes, urea, glucose, and amino acids) are freely filterable. However, if the solute (e.g., $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, phosphate, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, and PAH ) binds to protein, then it will not

be freely filterable. For such solutes it is necessary to measure plasma binding and correct for the nonfilterable fraction of the solute. Second, for us to apply the mass balance equation (see Equation 33-6), the kidney must not synthesize, degrade, or accumulate the solute. An example of a solute that is synthesized by the kidney is ammonium. Examples of solutes degraded by the kidney include glutamine and glutamate (which are deaminated to yield ammonium) as well as several other amino acids and monocarboxylic and dicarboxylic acids.

When the kidney both reabsorbs and secretes a substance, clearance data are inadequate to describe renal handling. For example, if the proximal tubule completely reabsorbed a solute that a later segment then secreted, clearance data alone would imply that only filtration and some reabsorption occurred. We would have no reason to implicate secretion. Complex combinations of reabsorption and secretion occur with $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, uric acid, and urea.

Another useful parameter for gauging how the kidney handles a freely filtered solute is the fractional excretion (FE), which is the ratio of the amount excreted in the urine $\left(U_{X} \cdot \dot{V}\right)$ to the filtered load $\left(P_{X} \cdot\right.$ GFR $):$

$$
\mathrm{FE}_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \mathrm{GFR}}
$$

According to Equation 33-3, however, the term $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}\right.$. $\dot{\mathrm{V}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}$ ) is simply the clearance of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ :

$$
\mathrm{FE}_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathrm{GFR}}
$$

As discussed on pages 739-741, one estimates GFR by measuring the clearance of inulin $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {In }}\right)$. Thus, the FE of a freely filterable solute is the same as the clearance ratio

$$
\mathrm{FE}_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathrm{C}_{\text {In }}}
$$

## Microscopic techniques make it possible to measure single-nephron rates of filtration, absorption, and secretion

Because clearance methods treat the kidney as a "black box," reflecting the activity of many single nephrons and nephron segments, it is very difficult to determine which nephron segments are responsible for which transport processes. It is also impossible to determine which nephrons are responsible for overall urinary excretion. To learn how single nephrons function, and to understand how individual nephron segments contribute to overall nephron function, physiologists developed a series of invasive techniques for studying renal cells in the research laboratory (Fig. 33-9). 0 N33-5

To apply the concept of clearance to a single nephron site, one uses the free-flow micropuncture approach (see Fig. 33-9A) and measures the concentration of the solute in the tubule fluid at that site $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$, volume flow at that site (i.e., the collection rate), and plasma concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$. By analogy with the macroscopic clearance equation, we can write a clearance equation for a single nephron:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}=\frac{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{x}} \times \text { Volume collection rate }}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}}
$$

Compared with Equation 33-3, here $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{X}}$ replaces $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}$ and "Volume collection rate" replaces $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$. We can use this basic equation to compute the amount of fluid that a single nephron filters, as well as the amounts of fluid and solutes that a single tubule segment handles.

Single-Nephron GFR If X in Equation 33-12 is a marker for GFR (e.g., inulin, or In), one can calculate single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) using an equation that is similar to that in Table 33-2, section C, to calculate total GFR:

$$
\mathrm{SNGFR}=\frac{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}} \times \text { Volume collection rate }}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}}
$$

Using the numeric values for rat kidney shown in Figure 33-10, we can use Equation 33-13 to compute the SNGFR:

$$
\mathrm{SNGFR}=\frac{(3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}) \times(10 \mathrm{~nL} / \mathrm{min})}{(1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL})}=30 \mathrm{~nL} / \mathrm{min}
$$

## Handling of Water by Tubule Segments in a Single Nephron

We also can use the same information that we used to compute SNGFR to calculate the rate of water reabsorption between the glomerulus and the micropuncture site. The fraction of filtered water remaining at the micropuncture site is

$$
\frac{\text { Fraction of filtered }}{\text { water remaining }}=\frac{\text { Volume collection rate }}{\text { SNGFR }}
$$

Substituting the expression for SNGFR (see Equation 33-13) into Equation 33-15 yields

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Fraction of filtered } \\
& \text { water remaining }=\frac{\text { Volume collection rate }}{\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}} \times \text { Volume collection rate }\right) / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}} \\
& =\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}}{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, to know the fraction of filtered water remaining at the collection site, we do not need to know the collection rate, only the concentrations of inulin in blood plasma and at the collection site. In the example of Figure 33-10, in which the tubule reabsorbed two thirds of the fluid, the fraction of filtered water remaining at the sampling site is $(1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}) /(3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL})$ or $\sim 0.33$.

The fraction of filtered water reabsorbed is 1 minus the fraction of filtered water remaining:

Fraction of filtered water reabsorbed $=1-\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}}{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}}}$
In our example, the fraction of filtered water reabsorbed is $1-0.33$ or $\sim 0.67$.

Figure 33-9 Methods for studying renal function in the research laboratory.

Handling of Solutes by Tubule Segments in a Single Nephron We can use the same concepts of single-nephron clearance to quantitate the reabsorption or secretion of any solute along the tubule. The first step is to estimate the fraction of the filtered solute remaining at the puncture site. This parameter-the fractional solute delivery-is the ratio of the amount of solute appearing at the micropuncture site to the amount of solute filtered at the glomerulus (i.e., singlenephron filtered load):

$$
\text { Fractional solute delivery }=\frac{\text { Rate of solute delivery to }}{\text { micropuncture site }}
$$

The numerator is the product of volume collection rate and tubule solute concentration $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$, and the denominator is the product of SNGFR and the plasma solute concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}\right)$ :

Fractional solute delivery $=\frac{\text { Volume collection rate } \times \mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{x}}}{\text { SNGFR } \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}}$
In Equations 33-15 and 33-16, we saw that the ratio (volume collection rate/SNGFR) is $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{lo}} / \mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{ln}}\right)$. Making this substitution in Equation 33-19, we obtain an alternative expression for fractional solute excretion:

$$
\text { Fractional solute delivery }=\frac{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{X}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{ln}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{ln}}}
$$

The advantage of Equation 33-20 over Equation 33-19 is that no measurements of collection rates are required.

Equation 33-20 is important for understanding the transport of a solute along the nephron. If $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{x}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{x}}\right) /\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{lo}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{ln}}\right)$ is $>1$, secretion has occurred. Merely observing that the solute concentration in tubule fluid increases along the length of the nephron does not necessarily mean that the tubule secreted the solute; the concentration would also increase if water

![bo1221257579](bo1221257579.jpg)

Figure 33-10 Measurement of SNGFR. Data are for the rat.
were reabsorbed. We can conclude that secretion has occurred only if the solute concentration in tubule fluid, relative to its concentration in filtrate, exceeds the concentration ratio of inulin. If $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{S}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}\right) /\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}\right)$ is $<1$, reabsorption has occurred.

Rather than referring to the fraction of the solute excreted (i.e., remaining) up to the point of the micropuncture site, we can also refer to the fractional solute reabsorption at the puncture site. By analogy to Equation 33-17 for water, this parameter for a solute is merely 1 minus the fractional solute excretion:

$$
\text { Fractional solute reabsorption }=1-\frac{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{X}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}}{\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{In}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}}
$$

Thus, applying the principles of clearance and mass balance to a single nephron, we can calculate SNGFR as well as the fractional reabsorption of water and solutes at the micropuncture site.

## THE URETERS AND BLADDER

As discussed in Chapters 44 and 45, the epithelium of the gastrointestinal (GI) system continues to modify the contents of the GI tract up until the point where the contents finally exit the body. The situation is very different in the mammalian urinary system. By the time the fluid leaves the most distal portion of the collecting duct, the fluid has the composition of final urine. Thus, the renal pelvis, ureters, bladder, and urethra do not substantially modify the urine volume or composition.

## The ureters propel urine from the renal pelvis to the bladder by peristaltic waves conducted along a syncytium of smooth-muscle cells

The ureters serve as conduits for the passage of urine from the renal pelvis into the urinary bladder (see Fig. 33-1A). Located in the retroperitoneum, each ureter loops over the top of the common iliac artery and vein on the same side of the body and courses through the pelvis. The ureters enter the lower posterior portion of the bladder (ureterovesical junction), pass obliquely through its muscular wall, and open into the bladder lumen 1 to 2 cm above, and lateral to, the orifice of the urethra (Fig. 33-11A). The two ureteral orifices, connected by a ridge of tissue, and the urethral orifice form the corners of a triangle (bladder trigone). A flap-like valve of mucous membrane covers each ureteral orifice. This anatomical valve, in conjunction with the physiological valve-like effect created by the ureter's oblique pathway through the bladder wall, prevents reflux of urine back into the ureters during contraction of the bladder.

The lumen of each ureter is lined by transitional epithelium, which is above a submucosal layer of connective tissue, as well as an inner longitudinal and an outer circular layer of smooth muscle. Ureteral smooth muscle functions as a syncytium and is thus an example of unitary smooth muscle (see pp. 243-244). Gap junctions (see pp. 158-159) conduct electrical activity from cell to cell at a velocity of 2 to $6 \mathrm{~cm} / \mathrm{s}$. Chemical or mechanical stimuli (e.g., stretch) or a suprathreshold membrane depolarization may trigger an action potential (see Fig. 33-11B) of the plateau type (see p. 244).

Contraction of ureteral smooth muscle is similar to that of other smooth muscle (see pp. 247-248), in which $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin activates myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). cAMP-dependent protein kinase (protein kinase A, or PKA) can phosphorylate MLCK, thereby lowering the affinity of MLCK for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin and impairing phosphorylation of myosin light chains. This mechanism may, at least in part, account for the relaxing effect of cAMP on smooth muscle.

Ureteral peristaltic waves originate from electrical pacemakers in the proximal portion of the renal pelvis. These waves propel urine along the ureters and into the bladder in a series of spurts at frequencies of 2 to 6 per minute. The intraureteral hydrostatic pressure is 0 to $5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at baseline but increases to 20 to $80 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ during peristaltic waves. Blockade of ureteral outflow to the bladder, as by a kidney stone, causes the ureter to dilate and increases the baseline hydrostatic pressure to 70 to $80 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ over a period of 1 to 3 hours. This pressure is transmitted in

B, Ureteral smooth-muscle cells generally have a resting membrane potential of about -60 mV , mainly determined by a high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$membrane permeability. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels speed the upstroke of the action potential, although $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are mainly responsible for the action potential.
retrograde fashion to the nephrons, creating a stopped-flow condition in which glomerular filtration nearly comes to a halt. Hydronephrosis, dilation of the pelvis and calyces of the kidney, can evolve over hours to days. Patients complain of severe pain (renal colic) resulting from distention of involved structures. If not cleared, the obstruction can cause marked renal dysfunction and even acute renal failure. With persistent obstruction, the pressure inside the ureter declines to a level that is only slightly higher than the normal baseline. Even though the patient produces no urine (anuria), glomerular filtration continues, albeit at a markedly reduced rate, a condition reflecting a balance between filtration and fluid reabsorption by the tubules.

Although ureteral peristalsis can occur without innervation, the autonomic nervous system can modulate peristalsis. As in other syncytial smooth muscle, autonomic control of the ureters occurs by diffuse transmitter release from multiple varicosities formed as the postganglionic axon courses over the smooth-muscle cell. Sympathetic input (via aortic, hypogastric, and ovarian or spermatic plexuses) modulates ureteral contractility as norepinephrine acts by excitatory $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors and inhibitory $\beta$-adrenergic receptors. Parasympathetic input enhances ureteral contractility via acetylcholine, either by directly stimulating muscarinic cholinergic receptors (see p. 341) or by causing postganglionic sympathetic fibers to release norepinephrine, which then can stimulate $\alpha$ adrenoceptors. Some autonomic fibers innervating the ureters are afferent pain fibers. In fact, the pain of renal colic associated with violent peristaltic contractions proximal to an obstruction is one of the most severe encountered in clinical practice.

## Sympathetic, parasympathetic, and somatic fibers innervate the urinary bladder and its sphincters

The urinary bladder consists of a main portion (body) that collects urine and a funnel-shaped extension (neck) that
connects with the urethra (see Fig. 33-11A). A transitional epithelium lines the bladder lumen. Three poorly defined layers of smooth muscle make up the bulk of the bladder wall, the so-called detrusor muscle. At the lower tip of the trigone, the bladder lumen opens into the posterior urethra (i.e., distal part of bladder neck), which extends over 2 to 3 cm . The wall of the posterior urethra contains smooth-muscle fibers of the detrusor muscle interspersed with elastic tissue, together forming the internal sphincter (Table 33-3). Immediately adjacent is the external sphincter, made up of voluntary, mainly slow-twitch striatedmuscle fibers.

In humans, bladder smooth muscle appears to lack gap junctions, which would indicate the absence of electrotonic coupling between cells. Thus, bladder smooth muscle is probably "multiunit" (see p. 243), with a $1: 1$ ratio between nerve endings and smooth-muscle cells. Contraction of bladder smooth muscle is typical of that of other smoothmuscle cells.

The bladder and sphincters receive sympathetic and parasympathetic (autonomic) as well as somatic (voluntary) innervation (Fig. 33-12). The sympathetic innervation to the bladder and internal sphincter arises from neurons in the intermediolateral cell column of the tenth thoracic to the second lumbar spinal cord segment (see pp. 335-339). The preganglionic fibers then pass via lumbar splanchnic nerves to the superior hypogastric plexus, where they give rise to the left and right hypogastric nerves. These nerves lead to the inferior hypogastric/pelvic plexus, where preganglionic sympathetic fibers synapse with postganglionic fibers. The postganglionic fibers continue to the bladder wall via the distal portion of the hypogastric nerve. This distal portion also contains the preganglionic parasympathetic axons discussed in the next paragraph.

The parasympathetic innervation of the bladder originates from the intermediolateral cell column in segments S2 through S4 of the sacral spinal cord (see p. 338). The

parasympathetic fibers approaching the bladder via the pelvic splanchnic nerve are still preganglionic. They synapse with postganglionic neurons in the body and neck of the urinary bladder.

The somatic innervation originates from motor neurons arising from segments S 2 to S 4 . Via the pudendal nerve, these motor neurons innervate and control the voluntary skeletal muscle of the external sphincter (see Fig. 33-12).

Figure 33-13 A cystometrogram.

## Bladder filling activates stretch receptors, initiating the micturition reflex, a spinal reflex under control of higher central nervous system centers

Bladder tone is defined by the relationship between bladder volume and internal (intravesical) pressure. One can measure the volume-pressure relationship by first inserting a catheter through the urethra and emptying the bladder, and then recording the pressure while filling the bladder with $50-\mathrm{mL}$ increments of water. The record of the relationship between volume and pressure is a cystometrogram (Fig. 33-13, blue curve). Increasing bladder volume from 0 to $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mL}$ produces a moderately steep increase in pressure. Additional volume increases up to $\sim 300 \mathrm{~mL}$ produce almost no pressure increase; this high compliance reflects relaxation of bladder smooth muscle. At volumes $>400 \mathrm{~mL}$, additional increases in volume produce steep increments in passive pressure. Bladder tone, up to the point of triggering the micturition reflex, is independent of extrinsic bladder innervation.

Cortical and suprapontine centers in the brain normally inhibit the micturition reflex, which the pontine micturition center (PMC) coordinates. The PMC controls both the bladder detrusor muscle and the urinary sphincters. During the storage phase, stretch receptors in the bladder send afferent signals to the brain via the pelvic splanchnic nerves. One first senses the urge for voluntary bladder emptying at a volume of $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$ and senses fullness at 400 to 500 mL . Nevertheless, until a socially acceptable opportunity to void presents itself, efferent impulses from the brain, in a learned reflex, inhibit presynaptic parasympathetic neurons in the sacral spinal cord that would otherwise stimulate the detrusor muscle. Voluntary contraction of the external urinary sphincter probably also contributes to storage.

The voiding phase begins with a voluntary relaxation of the external urinary sphincter, followed by relaxation of the internal sphincter. When a small amount of urine reaches the proximal (posterior) urethra, afferents signal the cortex that voiding is imminent. The micturition reflex now continues as pontine centers no longer inhibit the parasympathetic preganglionic neurons that innervate the detrusor muscle. As a result, the bladder contracts, expelling urine. Once this

esions in the nervous system can lead to bladder dysfunction, the characteristics of which will depend on the site of the neural lesion. Three major classes of lesions can be distinguished:

1. Combined afferent and efferent lesions. Severing both afferent and efferent nerves initially causes the bladder to become distended and flaccid. In the chronic state of the so-called decentralized bladder, many small contractions of the progressively hypertrophied bladder muscles replace the coordinated micturition events. Although small amounts of urine can be expelled, a residual volume of urine remains in the bladder after urination.
2. Afferent lesions. When only the sacral dorsal roots (sensory fibers) are interrupted, reflex contractions of the bladder in response to stimulation of the stretch receptors are totally abolished. The bladder frequently becomes distended, the wall thins, and bladder tone decreases. However, some residual contractions remain because of the intrinsic contractile response of smooth muscle to stretch. As a rule, a residual urine volume is present after urination.
3. Spinal cord lesions. The effects of spinal cord transection (e.g., in paraplegic patients) include the initial state of spinal shock in which the bladder becomes overfilled and exhibits sporadic voiding ("overflow incontinence"). With time, the voiding reflex is re-established, but with no voluntary control. Bladder capacity is often reduced and reflex hyperactivity may lead to a state called spastic neurogenic bladder. Again, the bladder cannot empty completely, so that significant residual urine is present. Urinary tract infections are frequent because the residual urine volume in the bladder serves as an incubator for bacteria. In addition, during the period of "overflow incontinence," before the voiding reflex is re-established, these patients have to be catheterized frequently, which further predisposes to urinary tract infections.
micturition reflex has started, the initial bladder contractions lead to further trains of sensory impulses from stretch receptors, thus establishing a self-regenerating process (see Fig. 33-13, red spikes moving to the left). At the same time, the cortical centers inhibit the external sphincter muscles. Voluntary urination also involves the voluntary contraction of abdominal muscles, which further raises bladder pressure and thus contributes to voiding and complete bladder emptying.

The basic bladder reflex that we have just discussed, although inherently an autonomic spinal cord reflex, may be either facilitated or inhibited by higher centers in the central nervous system that set the level at which the threshold for voiding occurs.

Because of the continuous flow of urine from the kidneys to the bladder, the function of the various sphincters, and the nearly complete emptying of the bladder during micturition, the entire urinary system is normally sterile (Box 33-1).

# GLOMERULAR FILTRATION AND RENAL BLOOD FLOW 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

## GLOMERULAR FILTRATION

## A high glomerular filtration rate is essential for maintaining stable and optimal extracellular levels of solutes and water

Qualitatively, the filtration of blood plasma by the renal glomeruli is the same as the filtration of blood plasma across capillaries in other vascular beds (see pp. 467-468). Glomerular ultrafiltration results in the formation of a fluid-the glomerular filtrate-with solute concentrations that are similar to those in plasma water. However, proteins, other high-molecular-weight compounds, and proteinbound solutes are present at reduced concentration. The glomerular filtrate, like filtrates formed across other body capillaries, is free of formed blood elements, such as red and white blood cells.

Quantitatively, the rate of filtration that occurs in the glomeruli greatly exceeds that in all the other capillaries of the circulation combined because of greater Starling forces (see pp. 467-468) and higher capillary permeability. Compared with other organs, the kidneys receive an extraordinarily large amount of blood flow-normalized to the mass of the organ-and filter an unusually high fraction of this blood flow. Under normal conditions, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR; see p. 732) of the two kidneys is $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ or $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. Such a large rate of filtrate formation is required to expose the entire extracellular fluid (ECF) frequently ( $>10$ times a day) to the scrutiny of the renaltubule epithelium. If it were not for such a high turnover of the ECF, only small volumes of blood would be "cleared" per unit time (see p. 731) of certain solutes and water. Such a low clearance would have two harmful consequences for the renal excretion of solutes that renal tubules cannot adequately secrete.

First, in the face of a sudden increase in the plasma level of a toxic material-originating either from metabolism or from food or fluid intake-the excretion of the material would be delayed. A high blood flow and a high GFR allow the kidneys to eliminate harmful materials rapidly by filtration.

A second consequence of low clearance would be that steady-state plasma levels would be very high for waste materials that depend on filtration for excretion. The following example by Robert Pitts, a major contributor to renal physiology, illustrates the importance of this concept. Consider two individuals consuming a diet that contains $70 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of protein, one with normal renal function (e.g., GFR of

180 L/day) and the other a renal patient with sharply reduced glomerular filtration (e.g., GFR of $18 \mathrm{~L} /$ day). Each individual produces $12 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of nitrogen in the form of urea (urea nitrogen) derived from dietary protein and must excrete this into the urine. However, these two individuals achieve urea balance at very different blood urea levels. We make the simplifying assumption that the tubules neither absorb nor secrete urea, so that only filtered urea can be excreted, and all filtered urea is excreted. The normal individual can excrete $12 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of urea nitrogen from 180 L of blood plasma having a [blood urea nitrogen] of $12 \mathrm{~g} / 180 \mathrm{~L}$, or $6.7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. In the patient with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), whose GFR may be only $10 \%$ of normal, excreting $12 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of urea nitrogen requires that each of the 18 L of filtered blood plasma have a blood urea nitrogen level that is 10 times higher, or $67 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thus, excreting the same amount of urea nitrogen-to maintain a steady state-requires a much higher plasma blood urea nitrogen concentration in the ESRD patient than in the normal individual.

## The clearance of inulin is a measure of GFR

The ideal glomerular marker for measuring GFR would be a substance X that has the same concentration in the glomerular filtrate as in plasma and that also is not reabsorbed, secreted, synthesized, broken down, or accumulated by the tubules (Table 34-1). In Equation 33-4, we saw that

$$
\frac{\frac{\text { Input into }}{\text { Bowman's space }} \frac{\text { Output into }}{\text { urine }}}{\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{GFR}}{\mathrm{mg}}}{\mathrm{~mL}} \frac{\mathrm{~mL}}{\min }}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{mg}}}{\frac{\mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~mL}}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \cdot \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{mg}}}{\frac{\mathrm{~mL}}{\mathrm{~mL}}}
$$

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the concentration of the solute in plasma, GFR is the sum of volume flow of filtrate from the plasma into all Bowman's spaces, $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}}$ is the urine concentration of the solute, and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ is the urine flow. Rearranging this equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{GFR} & =\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{X}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}} \\
\frac{\mathrm{~mL}}{\min } & =\frac{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}) \times(\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min})}{(\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL})}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that Equation 34-2 has the same form as the clearance equation (see Equation 33-3) and is identical to Equation

33-5. Thus, the plasma clearance of a glomerular marker is the GFR. 5 N34-1

Inulin is an exogenous starch-like fructose polymer that is extracted from the Jerusalem artichoke and has a molecular weight of 5000 Da . Inulin is freely filtered at the glomerulus, but neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules (Fig. 34-1A). Inulin also fulfills the additional requirements listed in Table 34-1 for an ideal glomerular marker.

Assuming that GFR does not change, three tests demonstrate that inulin clearance is an accurate marker of GFR. First, as shown in Figure 34-1B, the rate of inulin excretion

## TABLE 34-1 Criteria for Use of a Substance to Measure GFR

1. Substance must be freely filterable in the glomeruli.
2. Substance must be neither reabsorbed nor secreted by the renal tubules.
3. Substance must not be synthesized, broken down, or accumulated by the kidney.
4. Substance must be physiologically inert (not toxic and without effect on renal function).

$\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{In}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ is directly proportional to the plasma inulin concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}\right)$, as implied by Equation 34-2. The slope in Figure 34-1B is the inulin clearance. Second, inulin clearance is independent of the plasma inulin concentration (see Fig. 34-1C). This conclusion was already implicit in Figure 34-1B, in which the slope (i.e., inulin clearance) does not vary with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}$. Third, inulin clearance is independent of urine flow (see Fig. 34-1D). Given a particular $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}$, after the renal corpuscles filter the inulin, the total amount of inulin in the urine does not change. Thus, diluting this glomerular marker in a large amount of urine, or concentrating it in a small volume, does not affect the total amount of inulin excreted $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{In}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$. If the urine flow is high, the urine inulin concentration will be proportionally low, and vice versa. Because $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{In}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ is fixed, $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{In}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right) / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{In}}$ is also fixed.

Two lines of evidence provide direct proof that inulin clearance represents GFR. First, by collecting filtrate from single glomeruli, Richards and coworkers showed in 1941 that the concentration of inulin in Bowman's space of the mammalian kidney is the same as that in plasma. Thus, inulin is freely filtered. Second, by perfusing single tubules with known amounts of labeled inulin, Marsh and

# N34-1 Units of Clearance 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Clearance values are conventionally given in milliliters of total plasma per minute, even though plasma consists of $93 \%$ "water" and 7\% protein, with only the "plasma water"-that is, the protein-free plasma solution, including all solutes small enough to undergo filtration-undergoing glomerular filtration. As pointed out in Chapter 5 (see Table 5-2) the concentrations of plasma solutes can be expressed in millimoles per liter of total plasma, or millimoles per liter of protein-free plasma (i.e., plasma water). Customarily, clinical laboratories report values in millimoles (or milligrams) per deciliter of plasma, not plasma water. When we say that the GFR is $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, we mean that each minute the kidney filters all ions and small solutes contained in 125 mL of plasma. However, because the glomerular capillary blood retains the proteins, only 0.93 $\times 125 \mathrm{~mL}=116 \mathrm{~mL}$ of plasma water appear in Bowman's capsule. Nevertheless, GFR is defined in terms of volume of blood plasma filtered per minute rather than in terms of the volume of protein-free plasma solution that actually arrives in Bowman's space (i.e., the filtrate).

Frasier showed that the renal tubules neither secrete nor reabsorb inulin.

Although the inulin clearance is the most reliable method for measuring GFR, it is not practical for clinical use. One must administer inulin intravenously to achieve reasonably constant plasma inulin levels. Another deterrent is that the chemical analysis for determining inulin levels in plasma and urine is sufficiently demanding to render inulin unsuitable for routine use in a clinical laboratory.

The normal value for GFR in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man is $\sim 125 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min . Population studies show that GFR is proportional to body surface area. Because the surface area of an average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man is $1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, the normal GFR in men is often reported as $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ per $1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ of body surface area. In women, this figure is $110 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ per $1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. Age is a second variable. GFR is very low in the newborn, owing to incomplete development of functioning glomerular units. Beginning at $\sim 2$ years of age, GFR normalizes for body surface area and gradually falls off with age as a consequence of progressive loss of functioning nephrons.

## The clearance of creatinine is a useful clinical index of GFR

Because inulin is not a convenient marker for routine clinical testing, nephrologists use other compounds that have clearances similar to those of inulin. The most commonly used compound in human studies is ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}$-iothalamate. However, even ${ }^{125} \mathrm{I}$-iothalamate must be infused intravenously and is generally used only in clinical research studies rather than in routine patient care.

The problems of intravenous infusion of a GFR marker can be completely avoided by using an endogenous substance with inulin-like properties. Creatinine is such a substance, and creatinine clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$ is commonly used to estimate GFR in humans. Tubules, to a variable degree, secrete creatinine, which, by itself, would lead to a $\sim 20 \%$ overestimation of GFR in humans. Moreover, when GFR falls to low levels with chronic kidney disease, the overestimation of GFR by $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ becomes more appreciable. In clinical practice, determining $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ is an easy and reliable means of assessing the GFR, and such determination avoids the need to inject anything into the patient. One merely obtains samples of venous blood and urine, analyzes them for creatinine concentration, and makes a simple calculation (see Equation 34-3 below). Although $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ may overestimate the absolute level of GFR, assessing changes in $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ is extremely useful for monitoring relative changes in GFR in patients.

The source of plasma creatinine is the normal metabolism of creatine phosphate in muscle. In men, this metabolism generates creatinine at the rate of 20 to $25 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight per day (i.e., $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ man). In women, the value is 15 to $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight per day (i.e., $\sim 1.2$ $\mathrm{g} /$ day in a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ woman), owing to a lower muscle mass. In the steady state, the rate of urinary creatinine excretion equals this rate of metabolic production. Because metabolic production of creatinine largely depends on muscle mass, the daily excretion of creatinine depends strongly not only on gender but also on age, because elderly patients tend to have lower muscle mass. For a $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ measurement, the patient generally collects urine over an entire 24 -hour period, and
![bo2021257579](bo2021257579.jpg)

Figure 34-2 Dependence of plasma creatinine and blood urea nitrogen on the GFR. In the steady state, the amount of creatinine appearing in the urine per day $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{U}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ equals the production rate. Because all filtered creatinine $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$ appears in the urine, $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$ equals $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{U}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$, which is constant. Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ must increase as $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ (i.e., GFR) decreases, and vice versa. If we assume that the kidney handles urea in the same way that it handles inulin, then a plot of blood urea nitrogen versus GFR will have the same shape as that of creatinine concentration versus GFR.
the plasma sample is obtained by venipuncture at one time during the day based on the assumption that creatinine production and excretion are in a steady state.

Frequently, clinicians make a further simplification, using the endogenous plasma concentration of creatinine $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}\right)$, normally $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, as an instant index of GFR. This use rests on the inverse relationship between $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ :

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Cr}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}}=\mathrm{GFR}
$$

In the steady state, when metabolic production in muscle equals the urinary excretion rate $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Cr}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ of creatinine, and both remain fairly constant, this equation predicts that a plot of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ versus $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ versus GFR) is a rectangular hyperbola (Fig. 34-2). For example, in a healthy person whose GFR is $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, plasma creatinine concentration is $\sim 1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. The product of GFR $(100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min})$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ $(1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ is thus $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, which is the rate both of creatinine production and of creatinine excretion. If GFR suddenly drops to $50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ (Fig. 34-3, top), the kidneys will initially filter and excrete less creatinine (see Fig. 34-3, middle), although the production rate is unchanged. As a result, the plasma creatinine level will rise to a new steady state, which is reached at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ of $2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see Fig. 34-3, bottom). At this point, the product of the reduced GFR $(50 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min})$ and the elevated $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}(2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$ will again equal $1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, the rate of endogenous production of creatinine. Similarly, if GFR were to fall to one fourth of normal, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cr}}$ would rise to $4 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. This concept is reflected in the rightrectangular hyperbola of Figure 34-2. 034-2

## Molecular size and electrical charge determine the filterability of solutes across the glomerular filtration barrier

The glomerular filtration barrier consists of four elements (see p. 726): (1) the glycocalyx overlying the endothelial cells, (2) endothelial cells, (3) the glomerular basement membrane, and (4) epithelial podocytes. Layers 1, 3, and 4 are

# N34-2 Calculating Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Peter Aronson, Walter Boron, and Emile Boulpaep

Clinicians can use the plasma creatinine concentration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{cr}}\right)$ to calculate $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}}$-that is, the estimated GFR (eGFR)-without the necessity of collecting urine. Researches have derived empirical equations for calculating eGFR based on patient data, including not only $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}$, but also parameters that include patient age, weight,

$$
\frac{e^{e^{2} f r R}}{\mathrm{~mL} /\left(\min 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}=175\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{m g / d L} \cdot \frac{(\mathrm{Age})^{0.203 \cdot(\mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{years}}}{(0.742|/ / f f e m a l e|)} \cdot(1.212|/ / \text { African American }|) \cdot(N E 34-1)
$$

Thus, the MDRD calculation takes into account $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}$, age, sex, and-in the United States-whether or not the person is African American. Because MDRD is normalized to body surface area, it does not include body weight.

$$
\frac{e^{e^{2} f r R}}{\mathrm{~mL} /\left(\min 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}=141 \cdot\left[\text { smaller of }\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{k}\right) \text { or } 1\right]^{k} \cdot\left[\text { larger of }\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{k}\right) \text { or } 1\right]^{-1.209} \cdot(0.993)^{\mathrm{Age}} \cdot(1.018|/ / f f e m a l e|) \cdot(1.159|/ / \text { African American }|)
$$

Here, $k$ is 0.7 for females and 0.9 for males, and $a$ is -0.329 for females and -0.411 for males. In the first bracketed term, we take the larger of $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}} / k\right)$ or 1 , whereas in the second bracketed term, we take the smaller of $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}} / k\right)$ or 1 . Like the MDRD
gender, and race. In using these equations, we recognize that daily creatinine excretion depends on muscle mass, which in turn depends on age, weight, sex, and race. An example is the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Study equation:

$$
\frac{e^{e^{2} f r R}}{\mathrm{~mL} /\left(\min 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}\right)}=141 \cdot\left[\text { smaller of }\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{k}\right) \text { or } 1\right]^{k} \cdot[\text { larger of }\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{k}\right) \text { or } 1]^{-1.209} \cdot(0.993)^{\mathrm{Age}} \cdot(1.018|/ / f f e m a l e|) \cdot(1.159|/ / \text { African American }|)
$$

(d) calculation, the CKD-EPI eGFR is normalized to body surface area (i.e., it does not include body weight).

The Cockcroft-Gault calculator for eGFR,

$$
\frac{e^{e^{2} f r R}}{\mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}}=\frac{140(\mathrm{Age}) \cdot(\text { Weight })(0.85|/ / f f e m a l e|)}{72\left(\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}}{\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}}\right.}
$$

(takes into account $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}$, weight (ideally, lean body mass), sex, and age. For example, for a male aged 22 and weighing 60 kg , the Cockcroft-Gault calculator

$$
\frac{e^{e^{2} f r R}}{\mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}}=\frac{140(22) \cdot \frac{k g}{60 \mathrm{~kg}} \cdot(1 \text { for a male })}{72(1.0)}=122 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}=175 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{day}
$$

$(\mathrm{NE} 34-4)$
yields an eGFR of $122 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.
The National Kidney Foundation (NKF) recommends that one calculate eGFR with each determination of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}}$.

The gene mutations that cause excessive urinary excretion of albumin (nephrotic syndrome; see p. 727) generally affect slit diaphragm proteins, which suggests that the junctions between adjacent podocytes are the predominant barrier to filtration of macromolecules.

Table 34-2 summarizes the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier for different solutes, as estimated by the ratio of solute concentration in the ultrafiltrate versus the plasma $\left(\mathrm{UF}_{X} / \mathrm{P}_{X}\right)$. The ratio $\mathrm{UF}_{X} / \mathrm{P}_{X}$, also known as the sieving coefficient for the solute X , depends on molecular weight

and effective molecular radius. Investigators have used two approaches to estimate $\mathrm{UF}_{X} / \mathrm{P}_{X}$. The first, which is valid for all solutes, is the micropuncture technique (see Fig. 33-9A). Sampling fluid from Bowman's space yields a direct measurement of $\mathrm{UF}_{X}$, from which we can compute $\mathrm{UF}_{X} / \mathrm{P}_{X}$. The second approach, which is valid only for solutes that the kidney neither absorbs nor secretes, is to compute the clearance ratio (see p. 733), N34-3 the ratio of the clearances of $\mathrm{X}\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{X}}\right)$ and inulin $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{In}}\right)$.

Inspection of Table 34-2 shows that substances of low molecular weight ( $<5500 \mathrm{Da}$ ) and small effective molecular radius (e.g., water, urea, glucose, and inulin) appear in the filtrate in the same concentration as in plasma $\left(\mathrm{UF}_{X} /\right.$ $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{X}}=1$ ). In these instances, no sieving of the contents of the fluid moving through the glomerular "pores" occurs, so that the water moving through the filtration slits by convection carries the solutes with it. (5) N34-4 As a result, the concentration of the solute in the filtrate is the same as that in bulk plasma. The situation is different for substances with a molecular weight that is greater than $\sim 14 \mathrm{kDa}$, such as lysozyme. Larger and larger macromolecules are increasingly restricted from passage.

In addition to molecular weight and radius, electrical charge also makes a major contribution to the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier. Figure 34-4A is a plot of the clearance ratio for uncharged, positively charged, and negatively charged dextran molecules of varying molecular size. Two conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, neutral dextrans with an effective molecular radius of $<2 \mathrm{~nm}$ pass readily across the glomerular barrier. For dextrans with a larger radius, the clearance ratio decreases with an increase in molecular size, so that passage ceases when the radius

# N34-3 Clearance Ratio 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

The clearance ratio is the ratio of the clearances of $X\left(C_{0}\right)$ and inulin $\left(C_{10}\right)$ :

$$
\frac{C_{x}}{C_{10}}=\frac{\left(U_{x} \times \dot{V}\right) / P_{x}}{\left(U_{10} \times \dot{V}\right) / P_{10}}=\frac{U_{x} / P_{x}}{U_{10} / P_{10}}
$$

The symbols $U, \dot{V}$, and $P$ have the same meanings as in Chapter 33: namely, $U$ is urine concentration, $\dot{V}$ is urine flow, $P_{X}$ is the plasma concentration of the solute $X$, and $P_{X}$ is the plasma concentration of inulin. We can now regroup the terms in the rightmost quotient to create the following expression:

$$
\frac{C_{x}}{C_{10}}=\frac{U_{x} /\left(U_{x} / P_{x}\right)}{P_{x}}
$$

We will now show that-if the tubules transport neither $X$ nor inulin-the numerator, $U_{x} /\left(U_{x} / P_{x}\right)$, is in fact the concentration of $X$ in Bowman's capsule, $\mathrm{UF}_{x}$, where the symbol UF means ultrafiltrate. Between Bowman's capsule and the final urine, the
reabsorption of water by the tubules should have concentrated both inulin and $X$ to the same extent, provided neither inulin nor $X$ is secreted or absorbed. The extent to which inulin has been concentrated is merely $U_{x} / P_{x}$. Therefore, if we know the concentration of $X$ in the urine, we merely divide $U_{x}$ by $U_{10} / P_{10}$ to obtain the concentration of $X$ in Bowman's capsule:

$$
U_{x} /\left(U_{10} / P_{10}\right)=U F_{x}
$$

Therefore, in Equation NE 34-6 we can replace the term $U_{x} /\left(U_{10} / P_{10}\right)$ by $U F_{x}$ :

$$
\frac{C_{x}}{C_{10}}=\frac{U F_{x}}{P_{x}}
$$

Thus, the ratio $U F_{x} / P_{x}$ is the same as the clearance ratio, which is the value shown in the rightmost column of Table 34-2. The clearance ratio is an index of the sieving coefficient $\left(U F_{x} / P_{x}\right)$ of the glomerular filtration barrier for solute $X$.

## N34-4 Filtration of Solutes Through Water-Filled Pores

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Filtration of solutes across the glomerular capillary barrier can be modeled as the movement of molecules through water-filled pores. The flux of a solute $X\left(J_{0}\right)$ through such glomerular poresthe rate at which $X$ crosses a unit area of the barrier-is the sum of the convective and the diffusional flux:

| Total $=$ | Convective | $+$ | Diffusional |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| flux | flux | flux |  |
| $J_{X}=J_{X}\left[X I_{0}\left(1-\sigma_{X}\right)\right.$ | $+$ | (Permeability of $X) \times\left(P_{X}-U F_{X}\right)$ |  |
|  |  |  |  |

In this equation, $J_{0}$ is the flux of fluid volume through the barrier, which is proportional to GFR. $P_{X}$ and $U F_{X}$ are the solute concentrations in plasma and filtrate, respectively.* $\sigma_{X}$ is the reflection coefficient for $X$ (see p. 468). The reflection coefficient is a measure of how well the barrier restricts or "reflects" the movement of the solute $X$ as water moves across the barrier by convective flow. $\sigma_{X}$ varies between zero (when convective movement of $X$ is unrestricted) and unity (when the solute cannot pass at all through the pore together with water). We use "permeability" here in the same sense as "permeability coefficient" on page 108 and in N5-6.

As we saw on page 742 and in Table 34-2, the filtrate/filtrand ratio $\left(U F_{x} / P_{x}\right)$-also known as the sieving coefficient-is unity for small solutes, such as urea, glucose, sucrose, and inulin. For these solutes, filtration does not lead to the development of a concentration gradient across the glomerular barrier. In other words, $\left(P_{X}-U F_{X}\right)$ is zero. Thus, the diffusional flux in Equation

NE 34-9 disappears, and all the movement of these small molecules must occur by convection.

For larger molecules, both the convective and diffusional terms in Equation NE 34-9 contribute to the flux of the solute $X$. At a normal GFR, any restriction to the movement of $X$ (i.e., $\sigma_{X}$ $>0$ ) will cause the concentration of $X$ to be less in the filtrate than in the plasma $\left(U F_{X}<P_{X}\right)$. As a result, there is a concentration gradient favoring the diffusion of $X$ from plasma into Bowman's space, as described by Equation NE 34-9. Two factors will enhance the relative contribution of the diffusional component. First, the more restricted the solute by the barrier, the lower the concentration of $X$ in the filtrate, and thus the greater the driving force for diffusion. Second, the greater and greater the GFR, the greater the flow of water into Bowman's space, the greater the dilution of $X$ in Bowman's space, the lower the $U F_{X}$, and thus the greater the driving force for diffusion of $X$.

For partially restricted molecules, the greater the GFR, the lower the $\mathrm{UF}_{X}$-as we just saw-and thus the lower the filtrate/ filtrand ratio. In the extreme case is which GFR falls to zero, the filtrate/filtrand ratio approaches unity as even relatively large molecules ultimately reach diffusion equilibrium. On the other hand, if GFR increases to very high values, the convective flow of water carrying low concentrations of the partially restricted solute dominates, and the filtrate/filtrand concentration ratio drops. Because hemodynamic factors such as blood pressure affect GFR (see pp. 745-750), one must carefully control these factors-and thus GFR-in order to use clearance ratios of macromolecules to characterize glomerular permeability.

exceeds 4.2 nm . Second, anionic dextrans (e.g., dextran sulfates) are restricted from filtration, whereas cationic dextrans (e.g., diethylaminoethyl dextrans) pass more readily into the filtrate. For negatively charged dextrans, the relationship between charge and filterability is characterized by a left shift of the curve relating molecular size to clearance ratio, whereas the opposite is true for positively charged dextrans.

The previously discussed results suggest that the glomerular filtration barrier carries a net negative charge that restricts the movement of anions but enhances the movement of cations. In some experimental models of glomerulonephritis, in which the glomerular barrier loses its negative charge, the permeability of the barrier to negatively charged macromolecules is enhanced. Figure 34-4B compares clearance ratios of dextran sulfate in normal rats and in rats with nephrotoxic serum nephritis. Clearance ratios of dextran sulfate are uniformly greater in the animals with nephritis. Thus, the disease process destroys negative charges in the filtration barrier and accelerates the passage of negatively charged dextrans. The red curve in Figure 34-4A shows that a neutral dextran with the same effective radius as albumin (i.e., 3.5 nm ) would have a clearance ratio of $\sim 0.1$, which
would allow substantial filtration and excretion. However, because albumin is highly negatively charged, its clearance ratio is nearly zero, similar to that of anionic dextrans (see Fig. 34-4A, green curve), and it is restricted from filtration. Glomerular diseases causing loss of negative charge in the glomerular barrier lead to the development of albuminuria. Glomerular diseases causing high rates of albumin filtration can lead to a low plasma [albumin] and the development of edema (see Box 20-1), a clinical condition known as nephrotic syndrome.

## Hydrostatic pressure in glomerular capillaries favors glomerular ultrafiltration, whereas oncotic pressure in capillaries and hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space oppose it

As is the case for filtration in other capillary beds (see pp. 467-468), glomerular ultrafiltration depends on the product of the ultrafiltration coefficient $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$ and net Starling forces.

$$

# N34-5 Effect of Molecular Shape on Permselectivity 

Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager
In addition to molecular size (i.e., effective molecular radius) and electrical charge, the shape of macromolecules may also affect the permselectivity of the glomerular barrier. Thus, two molecules can diffuse at the same rate-and thus have the same effective molecular radius-but have different shapes. Rigid or globular molecules have lower clearance ratios (i.e., sieving coefficients) than molecules of a similar size (e.g., dextrans), which are highly deformable.

In B, the oncotic pressure of the glomerular capillary $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}\right)$, which starts off at the value of normal arterial blood, rises as ultrafiltration removes fluid from the capillary. In $\mathbf{C}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ is the net driving force favoring ultrafiltration. ( $\mathrm{N34-9}$

B STARLING FORCES ALONG THE GLOMERULAR CAPILLARIES
![bo2421257579](bo2421257579.jpg)

C $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ ALONG THE GLOMERULAR CAPILLARIES
![bo2521257579](bo2521257579.jpg)

Figure 34-5A provides a schematic overview of the driving forces affecting ultrafiltration. Hydrostatic pressure in the glomerular capillary $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}\right)$ favors ultrafiltration. Hydrostatic pressure in Bowman's space ( $\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{RS}}$ ) opposes ultrafiltration. Oncotic pressure in the glomerular capillary $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}\right)$ opposes ultrafiltration. Oncotic pressure of the filtrate in Bowman's space $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{RS}}\right)$ favors ultrafiltration. Thus, two forces favor filtration ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{RS}}$ ), and two oppose it ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{RS}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}$ ).

The net driving force favoring ultrafiltration ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ ) at any point along the glomerular capillaries is the difference between the hydrostatic pressure difference and the oncotic pressure difference between the capillary and Bowman's space. Thus, GFR is proportional to the net hydrostatic force $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}-\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{RS}}\right)$ minus the net oncotic force $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}-\pi_{\mathrm{RS}}\right)$.

As far as the hydrostatic pressure difference is concerned, the unique arrangement in which afferent and efferent arterioles flank the glomerular capillary keeps the first term, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$, at $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Fig. 34-5B), a value that is twice as high as that in most other capillaries (see pp. 467-468). Moreover, direct measurements of pressure in rodents show that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ decays little between the afferent and efferent ends of glomerular capillaries. The second term of the hydrostatic pressure difference, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{RS}}$, is $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and does not vary along the capillary.

As far as the oncotic driving forces are concerned, the first term, $\pi_{\mathrm{RS}}$, is very small (see Fig. 34-5B). The second term, $\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}$ starts off at 25 mm Hg at the beginning of the capillary. As a consequence of the continuous production of a proteinfree glomerular filtrate-and the resulting concentration of plasma proteins-the oncotic pressure of the fluid left behind
in the glomerular capillary progressively rises along the capillary.

Figure 34-5C compares the two forces favoring ultrafiltration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}+\pi_{\mathrm{RS}}\right)$ with the two forces opposing ultrafiltration $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{RS}}+\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}\right)$ and shows how they vary along the glomerular capillary. The rapid increase in the oncotic pressure of capillary blood $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}\right)$ is the major reason why the forces favoring and opposing filtration may balance each other at a point some distance before the end of the glomerular capillary. Beyond this point, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ is zero and the system is said to be in filtration equilibrium (i.e., no further filtration).

Note that $K_{f}$ in Equation 34-4 is the product of the hydraulic conductivity of the capillary $\left(\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{p}}\right)$ and the effective surface area available for filtration $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$, as defined in Table 20-4. We use $K_{f}$ because it is experimentally difficult to assign values to either $\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{p}}$ or $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{f}}$. The value of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ of the glomerular filtration barrier exceeds-by more than an order of magnitude-the $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ of all other systemic capillary beds combined. This difference in $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ values underlies the tremendous difference in filtration, $\sim 180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day in the kidneys (which receive $\sim 20 \%$ of the cardiac output) compared with $\sim 20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day (see pp. 475-476) in the combined arteriolar ends of capillary beds in the rest of the body (which receive the other $\sim 80 \%$ ).

Alterations in the glomerular capillary surface areaowing to changes in mesangial-cell contractility (see p. 727)-can produce substantial changes in the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{f}}$ component of $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$. These cells respond to extrarenal hormones such as systemically circulating angiotensin II (ANG II), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and parathyroid hormone. Mesangial

# N34-9 Starling Forces Along the Glomerular Capillary 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

The $\pi_{0 C}$ curve in Figure 34-5B is the result of a computer simulation that is based on Equation 34-4 (shown here as Equation NE 34-10):

$$
\mathrm{GFR}=\mathrm{K}_{1} \cdot\left[\left(\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)-\left(\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)\right]
$$

(NE 34-10)

We recall from the text that, by definition, FF is related to GFR and RPF by Equation 34-6 (shown here as Equation NE 34-11):

$$
\mathrm{FF}=\frac{\mathrm{GFR}}{\mathrm{RPF}}
$$

(NE 34-11)
Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{FF} \cdot \mathrm{RPF} & =\mathrm{GFR}=\mathrm{K}_{1} \cdot \underbrace{\left(\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)-\left(\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}} \\
\mathrm{FF} & =\frac{\mathrm{K}_{1}}{\mathrm{RPF}} \underbrace{\left[\left(\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)-\left(\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)\right]}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}} \\
\mathrm{FF} & =\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\prime} \cdot \underbrace{\left(\left(\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)-\left(\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)\right]}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that $\mathrm{K}_{1}^{\prime}$ is merely $\mathrm{K}_{4} / \mathrm{RPF}$.
Equation NE 34-10 is presented in textbooks-including ours-as if it applies to the macroscopic GFR (e.g., $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) that the two kidneys together produce via the actions of all $\sim 2,000,000$ of their glomeruli. In reality, Equation NE 34-10 really applies only to a microscopic GFR, that is, a rate of filtration at a particular point along the glomerular capillary of a particular glomerulus.* The reasons are that (1) $\pi_{0 C}$-and thus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$-change continuously along the glomerular capillary, and (2) $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ as well as this $\pi_{0 C}$ profile are not identical for all glomeruli. Thus, Equation NE 34-10 really is valid only at a particular point along a particular glomerular capillary, where $\pi_{0 C}$ has a particular value. ${ }^{+}$The same is true for Equation NE 34-12. To make this point more clear, we will define the microscopic filtration fraction (ff) and its counterpart $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$-relevant for a small stretch of a particular glomerular capillary-as we march down this capillary:

$$
\mathrm{ff}=\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime} \cdot \underbrace{\left[\left(\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)-\left(\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}-\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}\right)\right]}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}}
$$

(NE 34-13)
We will now apply Equation NE 34-13 at multiple points along a theoretical monolithic capillary, arbitrarily dividing the capillary into 100 identical segments. For the first of these 100 segments, we assume that all the terms that determine $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ have the values shown in Figure 34-5A at distance $(x)=0$ :
$\mathrm{P}_{0 \mathrm{C}}=50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
$\pi_{0 C}=25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}=10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
$\pi_{\mathrm{BS}}=0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$
Thus, at $x=0$, the forces favoring filtration are $\left(P_{0 C}+\pi_{B S}\right)=$ 50 mm Hg (green curve in Fig. 34-5C), whereas the forces opposing filtration are $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BS}}+\pi_{0 \mathrm{C}}\right)=35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (red curve in Fig.
34-5C). The net ultrafiltration pressure $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{U F}}\right)$ at time $=0$ is therefore $50-35=15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (vertical distance between the green and red curves, colored gold in Fig. 34-5C).

We then apply Equation NE 34-13, multiplying this $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}\right)_{\text {Dissenswell }}$ by a preassigned value for $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$. Recall that this value of $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ has built into it not only the microscopic filtration coefficient per se, but also microscopic RPF, and it has the units $\left(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}\right.$. Thus, the product of $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ in our model is the fraction of the initial ECF volume (inside the glomerular capillary) lost in the first of the 100 segments of the capillary-the ff. Below, we will see that, for a normal RPF, $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ has the value $0.0001765(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$. Thus, the fraction of ECF lost from the capillary in the first $1 \%$ of the capillary is

$$
\text { ff in first of } 100 \text { segments }=\frac{0.0001765}{\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}} \cdot \frac{15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}}{P_{\mathrm{UF}}}=0.265 \%
$$

(NE 34-14)

That is, about $0.265 \%$ of the ECF originally in the capillary is lost (i.e., filtered) in the first $1 \%$ of the glomerular capillary. Stated differently, after the blood has passed the $1 \%$ mark, the ECF volume remaining in the glomerular capillary would be only $100 \%$ $-0.265 \%=99.735 \%$ as large as it was at the outset.

Because the mass of proteins in the blood ECF is fixed (we assume no filtration of proteins), $\pi_{0 C}$ must rise by the fraction by which ECF falls. In our example, at the end of the first $1 \%$ of distance, $\pi_{0 C}$ would be $(25 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) / 0.99735 \cong 25.0664 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. We will then use this new value of $\pi_{0 C}$ in the computation for the second iteration (i.e., for the second increment of $1 \%$ ), and so on, for a total of 100 iterations; that is, for the entire $100 \%$ of the distance. At the end of 100 iterations, we can sum up the 100 microscopic ff values to arrive at the macroscopic FF.

What is a bit tricky is assigning the value for $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$. We do it in the following way. First, we define a standard GFR value (which we take to be $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) and a standard RPF value ( $600 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min ). Next, we guess at a provisional value for the standard $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$, insert it into the above equation, go through the 100 iterations, and then add up the 100 ff values to arrive at the macroscopic FF. From this FF value-as well as RPF-we compute GFR using Equation NE 34-11. If this provisional standard $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ does not produce the desired GFR of $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, we make another guess and repeat the process until we eventually arrive at the standard $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$. In our case, this standard $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ is $0.0001765\left(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}\right.$. Note that this value includes the standard RPF of $600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

The $\pi_{0 C}$ curve in Figure 34-5B actually represents a "low" RPF of $70.6 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ versus the standard RPF of $600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. The ratio of these two values is $600 / 70.6 \cong 8.5 \ldots$ and in our model we achieve this low RPF by multiplying our standard $\mathrm{k}_{1}^{\prime}$ by a factor of $\sim 8.5$, from $0.0001765\left(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}\right.$ to $0.0015\left(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}^{-1}\right.$.

Note that because $\pi_{0 C}$ exponentially rises from its initial value of 25 mm Hg to an asymptotic value of $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}$ exponentially decays from a maximal value of 15 mm Hg to zero, as shown by the vertical distance between the green and red curves (the gold area) in Figure 34-5C.

## RENAL BLOOD FLOW

Renal blood flow (RBF) is $\sim 1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ out of the total cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Normalized for weight, this blood flow amounts to $\sim 350 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each 100 g of tissue, which is 7 -fold higher than the normalized blood flow to the brain (see p. 558). Renal plasma flow (RPF) is

$$
\mathrm{RPF}=(1-\mathrm{Hct}) \cdot \mathrm{RBF}
$$

Given a hematocrit (Hct) of 0.40 (see p. 102), the "normal" RPF is $\sim 600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

Figure 34-6 Dependence of the GFR on plasma flow. (1) N34-10

## Increased glomerular plasma flow leads to an increase in GFR

At low glomerular plasma flow (Fig. 34-6A), filtration equilibrium occurs halfway down the capillary. At higher plasma flow (i.e., normal for humans), the profile of net ultrafiltration forces $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{UF}}\right)$ along the glomerular capillary stretches out considerably to the right (see Fig. 34-6B) so that the point of equilibrium would be reached at a site actually beyond the end of the capillary. Failure to reach equilibrium (filtration disequilibrium) occurs because the increased delivery of plasma to the capillary outstrips the ability of the filtration apparatus to remove fluid and simultaneously increase capillary oncotic pressure. As a result, $\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}$ rises more slowly along the length of the capillary.

As glomerular blood flow increases from low (see Fig. 34-6A) to normal (see Fig. 34-6B), the site of filtration

N34-9 described our computer model for generating plots of $\pi_{G C}$ versus distance along the glomerular capillary. The curves in Figure 34-6-4 are the same as in Figure 34-5C, and represent a low RPF of $70.6 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. For this condition of low RPF, we computed the $\pi_{G C}$ curve using a $\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\prime}$ of $0.0015(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$. (Remember from ( $\mathbf{N 3 4 - 9}$ that $\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\prime}$ is the embodiment of both the microscopic $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}$ and RPF.) As described in ( $\mathbf{N 3 4 - 9}$, summing the individual filtration events along the capillary yields the FF, which is $37.5 \%$ in this case. This is one of the points along the left end of the curve in Figure 34-6E. Multiplying RPF and FF yields the macroscopic GFR, which is the rather low value of $26.47 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This is one of the points along the left end of the curve in Figure 34-6D.

The curves in Figure 34-6B represent a normal RPF of $600 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min . For this condition of normal RPF, we computed the $\pi_{G C}$ curve using a $\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\prime}$ of $0.0001765(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$. Summing the individual filtration events along the capillary yields the FF, which is $20.8 \%$
in this case. This is the identified point along the curve in Figure 34-6E. Multiplying RPF and FF yields the macroscopic GFR, which is the normal value of $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This is identified point along the curve in Figure 34-6D.

The curves in Figure 34-6C represent a high RPF of $1200 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min . For this high RPF, we computed the $\pi_{G C}$ curve using a $\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{L}}^{\prime}$ of $0.00008825(\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})^{-1}$, that is, half the value in the "normal" example. Summing the individual filtration events along the capillary yields the FF, which is $11.9 \%$ in this case. This is one of the points along the right end of the curve in Figure 34-6E. Multiplying RPF and FF yields the macroscopic GFR, which is the elevated value of $142.6 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This is one of the points along the right end of the curve in Figure 34-6D.

Using the approach outlined in ( $\mathbf{N 3 4 - 9}$ we generated $\pi_{G C}$ curves-and thus FF and GFR values-for a wide range of RPF values. The plots in Figure 34-6D and $E$ are the results of these simulations.

equilibrium shifts distally (i.e., toward the efferent arteriole). This shift has two important consequences: First, as one progresses along the capillary, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CF}}$ (and hence filtration) remains greater when blood flow is higher. Second, more of the glomerular capillary is exposed to a net driving force for filtration, which increases the useful surface area for filtration. Thus, the end of the capillary that is "wasted" at low plasma flow rates really is "in reserve" to contribute when blood flow is higher.

A further increase in plasma flow stretches out the $\pi_{\mathrm{GC}}$ profile even more, so that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CF}}$ is even higher at each point along the capillary (see Fig. 34-6C). Single-nephron GFR (SNGFR) is the sum of individual filtration events along the capillary. Thus, SNGFR is proportional to the yellow area that represents the product of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CF}}$ and effective (i.e., nonwasted) length along the capillary. Because the yellow areas progressively increase from Figure 34-6A to Figure 34-6C, SNGFR increases with glomerular plasma flow. However, this increase is not linear. Compared with the normal situation, the GFR summed for both kidneys increases only moderately with increasing RPF, but decreases greatly with decreasing RPF (see Fig. 34-6D). Indeed, clinical conditions causing an acute fall in renal perfusion result in an abrupt decline in GFR.

The relationship between GFR and RPF also defines a parameter known as the filtration fraction (FF), which is the volume of filtrate that forms from a given volume of plasma entering the glomeruli:

$$
\mathrm{FF}=\frac{\mathrm{GFR}}{\mathrm{RPF}}
$$

Because the normal GFR is $\sim 125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ and the normal RPF is $\sim 600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, the normal FF is $\sim 0.2$. Because GFR saturates at high values of RPF, FF is greater at low plasma flows than it is at high plasma flows.

The dependence of GFR on RPF is analogous to the dependence of alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport on pulmonary blood flow (see pp. 671-673).

## Afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances control both glomerular plasma flow and GFR

The renal microvasculature has two unique features. First, this vascular bed has two major sites of resistance control, the afferent and the efferent arterioles. Second, it has two capillary beds in series, the glomerular and the peritubular capillaries. As a consequence of this unique architecture, significant pressure drops occur along both arterioles (Fig. 34-7), glomerular capillary pressure is relatively high throughout, and peritubular capillary pressure is relatively low. Selective constriction or relaxation of the afferent and efferent arterioles allows for highly sensitive control of the hydrostatic pressure in the intervening glomerular capillary, and thus of glomerular filtration.

Figure 34-8A provides an idealized example in which we reciprocally change afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance while keeping total arteriolar resistance-and thus glomerular plasma flow-constant. Compared with an initial condition in which the afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances are the same (see Fig. 34-8A, top panel), constricting the
![bo3121257579](bo3121257579.jpg)

Figure 34-7 Pressure profile along the renal vasculature.
afferent arteriole while relaxing the efferent arteriole lowers $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ (see Fig. 34-8A, middle panel). Conversely, constricting the efferent arteriole while relaxing the afferent arteriole raises $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ (see Fig. 34-8A, lower panel). From these idealized $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ responses, one might predict that an increase in afferent arteriolar resistance would decrease the GFR and that an increase in efferent arteriolar resistance should have the opposite effect. However, physiological changes in the afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance usually do not keep overall arteriolar resistance constant. Thus, changes in arteriolar resistance generally lead to changes in glomerular plasma flow, which, as discussed above, can influence GFR independent of glomerular capillary pressure.

Figure 34-8B and C show somewhat more realistic effects on RPF and GFR as we change the resistance of a single arteriole. With a selective increase of afferent arteriolar resistance (see Fig. 34-8B), both capillary pressure and RPF decrease, which leads to a monotonic decline in the GFR. In contrast, a selective increase of efferent arteriolar resistance (see Fig. 34-8C) causes a steep increase in glomerular capillary pressure but a decrease in RPF. As a result, over the lower range of resistances, GFR increases with efferent resistance as an increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ dominates. On the other hand, at higher resistances, GFR begins to fall as the effect of a declining RPF dominates. These opposing effects on glomerular capillary pressure and RPF account for the biphasic dependence of GFR on efferent resistance.

The examples in Figure 34-8B and C, in which only afferent or efferent resistance is increased, are still somewhat artificial. During sympathetic stimulation, or in response to ANG II, both afferent and efferent resistances increase. Thus, RPF decreases. The generally opposing effects on GFR of increasing both afferent resistance (see Fig. 34-8B) and efferent resistance (see Fig. 34-8C) explain why the combination of both keeps GFR fairly constant despite a decline in RPF.

In certain clinical situations, changes in either the afferent or the efferent arteriolar resistance dominate. A striking

example is the decrease in afferent arteriolar resistance-and large increase in RPF-that occurs with the loss of renal tissue, as after a nephrectomy in a kidney donor. As a result, GFR in the remnant kidney nearly doubles (see Fig. 34-8B). Another example is a situation that occurs in patients with congestive heart failure, who thus have a tendency toward decreased renal perfusion and-for reasons not well understood-greatly increased levels of vasodilatory prostaglandins ( $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ ). In these patients, GFR depends greatly on prostaglandin-mediated afferent arteriolar dilatation. Indeed, blocking prostaglandin synthesis with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; see p. 64) often leads to an acute fall in GFR in such patients.

An example of an efferent arteriolar effect occurs in patients with congestive heart failure associated with decreased renal perfusion. GFR in such patients depends greatly on efferent arteriolar constriction due to increased endogenous angiotensin levels. Administering angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-Is) to such patients often leads to an abrupt fall in GFR. If we imagine that the peak of the GFR curve in Figure 34-8C represents the patient before treatment, then reducing the resistance of the efferent arteriole would indeed cause GFR to decrease.

## Peritubular capillaries provide tubules with nutrients and retrieve reabsorbed fluid

Peritubular capillaries originate from the efferent arterioles of the superficial and juxtamedullary glomeruli (see Fig. 33-1C). The capillaries from the superficial glomeruli form a dense network in the cortex, and those from the juxtamedullary glomeruli follow the tubules down into the medulla, where the capillaries are known as the vasa recta (see pp. 722-723). The peritubular capillaries have two main functions. First, these vessels deliver oxygen and nutrients to the epithelial cells. Second, they are responsible for taking up from the interstitial space the fluid and solutes that the renal tubules reabsorb.

The Starling forces that govern filtration in other capillary beds apply here as well (Fig. 34-9A). However, in peritubular capillaries, the pattern is unique. In "standard" systemic capillaries, Starling forces favor filtration at the arteriolar end and absorption at the venular end (see pp. 471-472). Glomerular capillaries resemble the early part of these standard capillaries: the Starling forces always favor filtration (see Fig. 34-9B, yellow area). The peritubular capillaries are like the late part of standard capillaries: the Starling forces always favor absorption (see Fig. 34-9C, brown area).

What makes peritubular capillaries unique is that glomerular capillaries and the efferent arteriole precede them. Glomerular filtration concentrates the plasma proteins and thereby elevates the oncotic pressure of blood entering the peritubular capillary network $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}\right)$ to $\sim 35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In addition, the resistance of the efferent arteriole decreases the

intravascular hydrostatic pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}\right)$ to $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Fig. 34-9A). Interstitial oncotic pressure $\left(\pi_{o}\right)$ is 4 to 8 mm Hg , and interstitial hydrostatic pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ is probably 6 to 10 mm Hg . The net effect is a large net absorptive pressure at the beginning of the peritubular capillary. Along the peritubular capillary, $\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}$ falls modestly because of the reabsorption of protein-poor fluid from the interstitium into the capillary, and hydrostatic pressure probably falls modestly as well. Even so, the Starling forces remain solidly in favor of absorption along the entire length of the peritubular capillary, falling from $\sim 17 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the arteriolar end to $\sim 12 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the venular end (see Fig. 34-9C).

The net absorptive force at the beginning of the peritubular capillaries is subject to alterations in upstream arteriolar resistances and FF. For instance, expansion of the ECF volume (Fig. 34-10) inhibits the renin-angiotensin system (see pp. 841-842), leading to a relatively larger decrease in efferent than in afferent arteriolar resistance, and therefore to a rise in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}$. The fall in total arteriolar resistance causes a rise in RPF that is larger than the increase in GFR, thereby causing a fall in FF. Thus, more fluid remains inside the glomerular capillary, and the blood entering the peritubular capillaries has an oncotic pressure that is not as high as it

otherwise would be (e.g., $\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}<35 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). The fall in efferent arteriolar resistance also raises the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}$ (e.g., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}>$ 20 mm Hg ). As a consequence of the low $\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}$ and high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}$, the peritubular capillaries take up less interstitial fluid (see pp. 763-765). $\bigcirc$ N34-6 The reverse sequence of events takes place during volume contraction and in chronic heart failure.

Lymphatic capillaries are mainly found in the cortex, in association with blood vessels. They provide an important route for removing protein from the interstitial fluid. Proteins leak continuously from the peritubular capillaries into the interstitial fluid. Total renal lymph flow is small and amounts to $<1 \%$ of RPF.

## Blood flow in the renal cortex exceeds that in the renal medulla

Measurements of regional blood flow in the kidney show that $\sim 90 \%$ of the blood leaving the glomeruli in efferent arterioles perfuses cortical tissue. The remaining $10 \%$ perfuses the renal medulla, with only $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ reaching the papilla. The relatively low blood flow through the medulla, a consequence of the high resistance of the long vasa recta, is important for minimizing washout of the hypertonic medullary interstitium and thus for producing a concentrated urine (see pp. 813-815).

## The clearance of para-aminohippurate is a measure of RPF

As discussed in Chapter 33, for any solute (X) that the kidney neither metabolizes nor produces, the only route of entry to the kidney is the renal artery, and the only two routes of exit are the renal vein and the ureter (see Fig. 33-7):

The foregoing equation (a restatement of Equation 33-1) is an application of the Fick principle used for measurements of regional blood flow (see p. 423). To estimate arterial RPF $\left(\mathrm{RPF}_{6}\right)$-or, more simply, RPF-we could in principle use the clearance of any substance that the kidney measurably excretes into the urine, as long as it is practical to obtain samples of systemic arterial plasma, renal venous plasma, and urine. The problem, of course, is sampling blood from the renal vein.

However, we can avoid the need for sampling the renal vein if we choose a substance that the kidneys clear so efficiently that they leave almost none in the renal vein. Paraaminohippurate (PAH) is such a substance (see pp. 731732). Because PAH is an organic acid that is not normally present in the human body, PAH must be administered by continuous intravenous infusion. Some PAH binds to plasma proteins, but a significant amount remains freely dissolved in the plasma and therefore filters into Bowman's space. However, the kidney filters only $\sim 20 \%$ of the RPF (i.e., $\mathrm{FF}=$ $\sim 0.2$ ), and a major portion of the PAH remains in the plasma that flows out of the efferent arterioles. PAH diffuses out of
the peritubular capillary network and reaches the basolateral surface of the proximal-tubule cells. These cells have a high capacity to secrete PAH from blood into the tubule lumen against large concentration gradients. This PAH-secretory system (see pp. 779-781) is so efficient that-as long as we do not overwhelm it by infusing too much PAH-almost no PAH ( 10\%) remains in the renal venous blood. We can therefore assume that all the PAH presented to the kidney appears in the urine:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { PAH excreted }= & \text { PAH filtered } \\
\text { in glomerulus }
\end{aligned}+\begin{aligned}
\text { PAH secreted in urine } \\
\text { by tubules }
\end{aligned}
$$

In the example of Figure 34-11, the concentration of filterable PAH in the arterial blood plasma $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}\right)$ is $10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or $0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}$. If RPF is $600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, then the arterial load of PAH to the kidney is $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. Of this amount, $12 \mathrm{mg} /$ min appears in the glomerular filtrate. If the tubules secrete the remaining $48 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, then the entire $60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$ of PAH presented to the kidney appears in the urine. That is, in the idealized example of Figure 34-11, during a single passage of blood the kidneys clear $100 \%$ of PAH presented

# N34-6 Effects of Hemodynamic Changes on Fluid Reabsorption by the Peritubular Capillaries 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The paragraph in the text analyzes an example in which expansion of the ECF volume inhibits the renin-angiotensin system, producing hemodynamic changes-that is, decreases in both afferent and efferent arteriolar resistance, but more so the latter. Thus, the fractional rise in GFR is less than the fractional rise in RPF, so that the FF falls. The analysis in the text focuses on forces inside the peritubular capillaries: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}$ and $\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}$. In addition, the hemodynamic changes in our example also lead to altered forces outside the peritubular capillaries. These changes in interstitial forces reduce fluid absorptionfrom the tubule lumen to the interstitium-by the proximal tubule. Thus, in this example, an increase in ECF volume leads to changes in renal hemodynamics, resulting in a parallel rise in GFR and a fall in fluid reabsorption from the proximal tubule to its peritubular capillaries. The result is an appropriate increase in fluid excretion into the urine.

We discuss the effect of hemodynamic changes on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and fluid transport in more depth beginning on page 763.

to them. In practice, the kidneys excrete only $\sim 90 \%$ of the arterial load of PAH, provided $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}$ does not exceed $12 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL. The excretion of $90 \%$ rather than $100 \%$ of the arterial load of PAH reflects the $10 \%$ of the RBF that perfuses the medulla, where the tubules do not secrete PAH.

As long as we do not infuse too much PAH-that is, as long as virtually no PAH remains in the renal venous bloodEquation 34-7 reduces to the equation for the clearance of PAH, as introduced in Table 33-2B:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{PAH}}=\mathrm{RPF}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{PAH}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}}
$$

If we apply this equation to the example in Figure 34-11,

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{PAH}}=\mathrm{RPF}=\frac{60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}}{10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}}=\frac{60 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}}{0.1 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{mL}}=600 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}
$$

To compute RPF, we need to collect a urine sample to obtain $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{PAH}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ and a blood sample to obtain $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PAH}}$. However, the blood sample need not be arterial. For example, one can obtain venous blood from the arm, inasmuch as skeletal muscle extracts negligible amounts of PAH.

## CONTROL OF RENAL BLOOD FLOW AND GLOMERULAR FLTRATION

## Autoregulation keeps RBF and GFR relatively constant

An important feature of the renal circulation is its remarkable ability to maintain RBF and GFR within narrow limits, although mean arterial pressure may vary between $\sim 80$ and 170 mm Hg (Fig. 34-12, middle and bottom panels). Stability of blood flow-known as autoregulation (see p. 481)-is also a property of the vascular beds serving two other vital organs, the brain and the heart. Perfusion to all three of these organs must be preserved in emergency situations, such as

hypotensive shock. Autoregulation of the renal blood supply is independent of the influence of renal nerves and circulating hormones, and persists even when one perfuses isolated kidneys with erythrocyte-free solutions. Autoregulation of RBF-and, consequently, autoregulation of GFR, which depends on RBF (see Fig. 34-6D)—stabilizes the filtered load of solutes that reaches the tubules over a wide range of arterial pressures. Autoregulation of RBF also protects the fragile glomerular capillaries against increases in perfusion pressure that could lead to structural damage.

The kidney autoregulates RBF by responding to a rise in renal arterial pressure with a proportional increase in the resistance of the afferent arterioles. Autoregulation comes into play during alterations in arterial pressure that occur, for example, during changes in posture, light to moderate exercise, and sleep. It is the afferent arteriole where the autoregulatory response occurs, and where the resistance to flow rises with increasing perfusion pressure (see Fig. 34-12, top panel). In contrast, efferent arteriolar resistance, glomerular and peritubular capillary resistances, as well as venous resistance all change very little over the range of normal to high renal arterial pressures. However, in the range of low renal perfusion pressures-as in congestive heart failureefferent arteriolar resistance increases, and thereby minimizes decreases in GFR.

Two basic mechanisms-equally important-underlie renal autoregulation: a myogenic response of the smooth muscle of the afferent arterioles and a tubuloglomerular feedback mechanism.

Myogenic Response The afferent arterioles have the inherent ability to respond to changes in vessel circumference by contracting or relaxing-a myogenic response (see p. 481). The mechanism of contraction is the opening of stretch-activated nonselective cation channels in vascular smooth muscle. The resultant depolarizing leads to an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that stimulates contraction (see p. 477).

Tubuloglomerular Feedback The juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA; see p. 727) mediates tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF). ( $\bigcirc$ N40-3 The macula densa cells in the thick ascending limb sense an increase in GFR and, in classic feedback fashion, translate this to a contraction of the afferent arteriole, a fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{GC}}$ and RPF, and hence a decrease in GFR.

Experimental evidence for the existence of a TGF mechanism rests on measurements of SNGFR. One introduces a wax block into the lumen of the proximal tubule to block luminal flow (Fig. 34-13A). Upstream from the wax block, a pipette collects the fluid needed to compute SNGFR (see Equation 33-13). Downstream of this wax block, another pipette perfuses the loop of Henle with known solutions and at selected flows. The key observation is that an inverse relationship exists between the late proximal perfusion rate (i.e., fluid delivery to the macula densa) and SNGFR (see Fig. 34-13B).

The mechanism of TGF is thought to be the following:

1. An increase in arterial pressure leads to increases in glomerular capillary pressure, RPF, and GFR.
2. Increased GFR leads to an increased delivery of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and fluid into the proximal tubule and, ultimately, to the macula densa cells of the JGA.

3. Macula densa cells do not sense flow per se, but the higher luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$or $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$resulting from high flow. Increases in luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]-$via the apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (see p. 122) of the macula densa cell—translate to parallel increases in intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$. Indeed, blocking the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter with furosemide (see p. 757) not only blocks the uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the macula densa cells, but also interrupts TGF.
4. The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{o}$ in conjunction with a basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channel, leads to a depolarization.
5. The depolarization activates a basolateral nonselective cation channel, which allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter the macula densa cell.
6. Increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ causes the macula densa cell to release paracrine agents, particularly adenosine and ATP, which breaks down to adenosine.
7. Adenosine, binding to $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ adenosine receptors on the smooth-muscle cells, triggers contraction of nearby vascular smooth-muscle cells (see Table 20-8).
8. Increased afferent arteriolar resistance decreases GFR, counteracting the initial increase in GFR.

Several factors modulate the sensitivity of the TGF mechanism (see Fig. 34-13B). Indeed, investigators have suggested that several of these factors may be physiological signals from the macula densa cells or modulators of these signals (Table 34-3).

## TABLE 34-3 Modulation of TGF

## Factors that Increase Sensitivity of TGF

## Factors that Decrease Sensitivity of TGF

## Volume expansion and a high-protein diet increase GFR by reducing TGF

The sensitivity of TGF is defined as the change in SNGFR for a given change in the perfusion rate of the loop of Henle. Thus, sensitivity is the absolute value of the slope of the curves in Figure 34-13B. The set-point of the feedback system is defined as the loop-perfusion rate at which SNGFR falls by $50 \%$.

Both the intrinsic sensitivity of the macula densa mechanism and the initial set-point for changes in flow are sensitive to changes in the ECF volume. Expansion of the ECF decreases the sensitivity (i.e., steepness) of the overall feedback loop. Conversely, volume contraction increases the sensitivity of TGF, thus helping preserve fluid by reducing GFR. Many of these effects may be mediated by ANG II, which is a required cofactor for TGF responses.

Of clinical importance is the observation that a highprotein diet increases GFR and RPF by indirectly lowering the sensitivity of the TGF mechanism. A high-protein diet somehow enhances NaCl reabsorption proximal to the macula densa, so that luminal $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ at the macula densa falls. As a consequence, the flow in the loop of Henle (and thus GFR) must be higher to raise $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ to a given level at the macula densa. A high-protein diet may thereby decrease TGF, increasing glomerular capillary pressure. This sequence of events may lead, particularly in the presence of intrinsic renal disease, to progressive glomerular damage.

## Four factors that modulate RBF and GFR play key roles in regulating effective circulating volume

Changes in effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555) trigger responses in four parallel effector pathways that ultimately modulate either renal hemodynamics or renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. The four effector pathways are (1) the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, (2) the sympathetic nervous system, (3) AVP, and (4) atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Beginning on page 836, we discuss the integrated control of effective circulating volume. Here, we focus on the direct actions of the four effector pathways on renal hemodynamics.

Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Axis In terms of renal hemodynamic effects, the most important part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is its middle member, the peptide hormone ANG II (see pp. 841-842). ANG II has multiple actions on renal hemodynamics (Table 34-4). The net effect of ANG II on blood flow and GFR depends on multiple factors. Under normal conditions, the effect of ANG II is primarily to mediate efferent arteriolar constriction, an effect that tends to maintain GFR when renal perfusion is reduced. The reason is that prostaglandins counteract any tendency of ANG II to constrict the afferent arteriole. Indeed, inhibition of prostaglandin production by NSAIDs
unmasks the constriction of the afferent arteriole, resulting in a decline in GFR.

Sympathetic Nerves Sympathetic tone to the kidney may increase either as part of a general response-as occurs with pain, stress, trauma, hemorrhage or exercise-or as part of a more selective renal response to a decrease in effective circulating volume (see pp. 842-843). In either case, sympathetic nerve terminals release norepinephrine into the interstitial space. At relatively high levels of nerve stimulation, both afferent and efferent arteriolar resistances rise, thus generally decreasing RBF and GFR. The observation that the RBF may fall more than the GFR is consistent with a preferential efferent arteriolar constriction. With maximal nerve stimulation, however, afferent vasoconstriction predominates and leads to drastic reductions in both RBF and GFR.

In addition, sympathetic stimulation triggers granular cells to increase their release of renin (see p. 841), raising levels of ANG II, which acts as described above. Finally, sympathetic activation-even at levels too low to reduce RBF and GFR-causes increased reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by proximal tubules (see pp. 766-768).

Arginine Vasopressin In response to increases in the osmotic pressure of the ECF, the posterior pituitary releases AVP-also known as antidiuretic hormone (see p. 843). Although the principal effect of this small polypeptide is to increase water absorption in the collecting duct, AVP also increases vascular resistance. Despite physiological fluctuations of circulating AVP levels, total RBF and GFR remain nearly constant. Nevertheless, AVP may decrease blood flow to the renal medulla, thereby minimizing the washout of the hypertonic medulla; this hypertonicity is essential for forming a concentrated urine.

In amphibians, reptiles, and birds, the generalized vascular effects of AVP are more pronounced than they are in mammals. In humans, severe decreases in effective circulating volume (e.g., shock) cause a massive release of AVP via nonosmotic stimuli (see p. 586). Only under these conditions does AVP produce a systemic vasoconstriction and thus contribute to maintaining systemic blood pressure (see p. 553).

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Atrial myocytes release ANP in response to increased atrial pressure and thus effective circulating volume (see p. 843). ANP markedly vasodilates

afferent and efferent arterioles, thereby increasing cortical and medullary blood flow, and lowers the sensitivity of the TGF mechanism (see Table 34-3). The net effect is an increase in RPF and GFR. ANP also affects renal hemodynamics indirectly by inhibiting secretion of renin (thus lowering ANG II levels).

Even without affecting GFR, low levels of ANP can be natriuretic by inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by tubules. First, ANP inhibits aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland (and thereby reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption; see pp. 765-766). Second, ANP acts directly to inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the inner medullary collecting duct (see p. 768). At higher levels, ANP decreases systemic arterial pressure and increases capillary permeability. ANP plays a role in the diuretic response to the redistribution of ECF and plasma volume into the thorax that occurs during space flight and water immersion (see p. 1233).

## Other vasoactive agents modulate RBF and GFR

Many other vasoactive agents, when infused systemically or applied locally to the renal vasculature, modulate RBF and GFR. Despite considerable research on such hemodynamic actions, the precise role of individual vasoactive agents in the response to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli remains uncertain because of the following three observations: (1) several agents with opposing actions are often released simultaneously; (2) blocking a specific vasoactive messenger may have relatively little effect on renal hemodynamics; and (3) a single vasoactive agent may have different, or even opposing, actions at low and high concentrations. Nevertheless, renal and extrarenal agents may cooperate to provide a full and physiologically adequate response to a wide spectrum of challenges. 0 N34-7

Epinephrine Released by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla (see p. 1030), epinephrine exerts dosedependent effects on the kidney that are similar to those of norepinephrine (see p. 752). 0 N34-8

Dopamine Dopaminergic nerve fibers terminate in the kidney, and dopamine receptors are present in renal blood vessels. In addition, proximal-tubule cells both produce dopamine and express dopamine receptors. The renal effects of dopamine-vasodilation and inhibition of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by tubules-are opposite to the effects of epinephrine and norepinephrine.

Endothelins The endothelins are peptides with a strong vasoconstrictor action (see p. 480) but a very short half-life. The hemodynamic actions of endothelins are limited to local effects, because little of these hormones escapes into the general circulation. In the kidney, several agents-ANG II, epinephrine, higher doses of AVP, thrombins, and shear
stress-trigger release of endothelins from the endothelium of renal cortical vessels and mesangial cells. The endothelins act locally to constrict smooth muscles of renal vessels and thus most likely are a link in the complex network of local messengers between endothelium and smooth muscle. When administered systemically, endothelins constrict the afferent and efferent arterioles and reduce the ultrafiltration coefficient $\left(\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{f}}\right)$. The result is a sharp reduction in both RBF and GFR.

Prostaglandins In the kidney, vascular smooth-muscle cells, endothelial cells, mesangial cells, and tubule and interstitial cells of the renal medulla are particularly important for synthesizing locally acting prostaglandins from arachidonic acid via the cyclooxygenase pathway (see pp. 62-64). The effects of prostaglandins are complex and depend on the baseline vasoconstriction exerted by ANG II. Indeed, prostaglandins appear mainly to be protective and are important under conditions in which the integrity of the renal circulation is threatened. In particular, local intrarenal effects of prostaglandins prevent excessive vasoconstriction, especially during increased sympathetic simulation or activation of the renin-angiotensin system. Accelerated prostaglandin synthesis and release are responsible for maintaining fairly constant blood flow and GFR in conditions of high ANG II levels (e.g., during surgery, following blood loss, or in the course of salt depletion).

Leukotrienes Probably in response to inflammation, the renal vascular smooth-muscle cells and glomeruli-as well as leukocytes and blood platelets-synthesize several leukotrienes from arachidonic acid via the lipoxygenase pathway (see pp. 64-65). These locally acting vasoactive agents are strong vasoconstrictors; their infusion reduces RBF and GFR.

Nitric Oxide The endothelial cells of the kidney use nitric oxide synthase (NOS) to generate nitric oxide (NO; see p. 66) from L-arginine. NO has a strong smooth muscle-relaxing effect and-under physiological, unstressed conditions-produces significant renal vasodilation. NO probably defends against excess vasoconstrictor effects of agents such as ANG II and epinephrine. Injecting NOS inhibitors into the systemic circulation constricts afferent and efferent arterioles, increasing renal vascular resistance and producing a sustained fall of RBF and GFR. Moreover, NOS inhibitors blunt the vasodilatation that is triggered by low rates of fluid delivery to the macula densa as part of the TGF mechanism.

## N34-8 Effects of Epinephrine on Renal Hemodynamics

Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager
Epinephrine increases renal vascular resistance. At lower epinephrine levels, GFR may be maintained despite a significant reduction of RBF, similar to the effects of moderate sympathetic nerve stimulation (see p. 752). This effect implies preferential efferent vasoconstriction. At higher doses, epinephrine decreases both GFR and RBF, similar to the effects of intense sympathetic nerve stimulation.

# TRANSPORT OF SODIUM AND CHLORIDE 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

The kidneys help to maintain the body's extracellular fluid (ECF) volume by regulating the amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the urine. Sodium salts (predominantly NaCl ) are the most important contributor to the osmolality of the ECF; hence, where $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ goes, water follows. This chapter focuses on how the kidneys maintain the ECF volume by regulating excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and its most prevalent anion, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

The normal daily urinary excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is only a tiny fraction of the total $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$filtered by the kidneys (Fig. 35-1). The filtered load of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is the product of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR, $\sim 180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) and the plasma $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration of $\sim 142 \mathrm{mM}$ (neglecting the small difference from $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in protein-free plasma water; see Table 5-2), or $\sim 25,500 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. This amount is equivalent to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~kg}$ of table salt, more than nine times the total quantity of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$present in the body fluids. For subjects on a typical Western diet containing $\sim 120 \mathrm{mmol}$ of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the kidneys reabsorb $\sim 99.6 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by the time the tubule fluid reaches the renal pelvis. Therefore, even minute variations in the fractional reabsorptive rate can lead to changes in total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that markedly alter ECF volume and, hence, body weight and blood pressure. Thus, it is not surprising that each nephron segment makes its own unique contribution to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ homeostasis.

## $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$AND $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$TRANSPORT BY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE NEPHRON

$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption decreases from proximal tubules to Henle's loops to classic distal tubules to collecting tubules and ducts

Figure 35-2 summarizes the segmental distribution of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption along the nephron. The proximal tubule reabsorbs the largest fraction of filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\sim 67 \%)$. Because $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in tubule fluid (or $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{N}}$; see p. 733) remains almost the same as that in plasma (i.e., $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{N}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}}=1.0$ ) throughout the length of the proximal tubule, it follows that the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$ in the reabsorbate is virtually the same as that in plasma. Because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$salts are the dominant osmotically active solutes in the filtrate, reabsorption must be a nearly isosmotic process. (3) N35-1

The loop of Henle reabsorbs a smaller but significant fraction of filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}(\sim 25 \%)$. Because of the low water permeability of the thick ascending limb (TAL), this nephron segment reabsorbs $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$faster than it reabsorbs water, so that $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$in the tubule fluid entering the distal convoluted tubule has decreased substantially $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{Na}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}} \cong 0.45\right)$.

The classic distal tubule (see p. 729) and collecting ducts reabsorb smaller fractions of filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water than do more proximal segments. The segments between the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) and the cortical collecting tubule (CCT), inclusive, reabsorb $\sim 5 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load under normal conditions. Finally, the medullary collecting duct reabsorbs $\sim 3 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load. Although the distal nephron reabsorbs only small amounts of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, it can establish a steep transepithelial concentration gradient and can respond to several hormones, including mineralocorticoids and arginine vasopres$\sin (\mathrm{AVP})$.

As discussed on pages 763-769, most nephron segments reabsorb greater amounts of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$when increased quantities of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$are delivered due to increased filtered load or inhibition of upstream $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption.

## The tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$via both the transcellular and the paracellular pathways

The tubule can reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$via both transcellular and paracellular pathways (Fig. 35-3A). In the transcellular pathway, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$sequentially traverse the apical and basolateral membranes before entering the blood. In the paracellular pathway, these ions move entirely by an extracellular route, through the tight junctions between cells. In the transcellular pathway, transport rates depend on the electrochemical gradients, ion channels, and transporters at the apical and basolateral membranes. However, in the paracellular pathway, transepithelial electrochemical driving forces and permeability properties of the tight junctions govern ion movements.

Transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Reabsorption The basic mechanism of transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption is similar in all nephron segments and is a variation on the classic two-membrane model

# N35-1 The Proximal-Tubule Reabsorbate Is Slightly Hyperosmotic 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Investigators have found that the lumen of the proximal tubule becomes slightly hypo-osmolar as the reabsorption of salt and water proceeds. Because the ultrafiltrate in Bowman's space is truly isosmotic with blood plasma, the reabsorbate (i.e., the fluid that the tubule reabsorbed) must be slightly hyperosmolar. Once the tubule has reabsorbed a slightly hyperosmolar solution, it has established an osmotic gradient along which water can flow by osmosis. The osmotic water permeability $(P_{i})$ of the proximal tubule is so high—owing to the extremely high expression of the water channel AQP1 in both the apical and basolateral membranes-that the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ very nearly keeps up, so to speak, with the solutes, in an osmotic sense. A mathematical way of stating this fact is that the ratio of the NaCl reabsorptive flux $\left(J_{\text {NaCl }}\right)$ to the reabsorptive volume or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ flux $\left(J_{0}\right)$ is nearly the same as the osmolality of the lumen:

$$
\frac{J_{\mathrm{NaCl}}}{J_{0}}=\text { Osmolality of reabsorbate } \cong \text { Osmolality of lumen }(\mathbf{N E} 35-1)
$$

In mice lacking AQP1, the water permeability of the proximal tubule is so low that the diffusion of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ can no longer keep up with the active reabsorption of $\mathrm{NaCl}, \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, and other solutes. As a result, the reabsorbate can become markedly hyperosmolar, and the fluid left behind becomes markedly hypo-osmolar. This situation is reminiscent of that in the TAL, which is sometimes called the diluting segment.

of epithelial transport (see pp. 137-138). The first step is the passive entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the cell across the apical membrane. Because the intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration ( $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ ) is low and the cell voltage is negative with respect to the lumen, the electrochemical gradient is favorable for passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry across the apical membrane (see Fig. 35-3B). However, different tubule segments use different mechanisms of passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry across the apical membrane. The proximal tubule, the TAL, and the DCT all use a combination of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransporters and exchangers to move $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the apical membrane; however, in the cortical and medullary collecting ducts, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$enters the cell through epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels ( ENaCs ).

The second step of transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption is the active extrusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$out of the cell across the basolateral membrane (see Fig. 35-3B). This $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion is mediated by the Na-K pump (see pp. 115-117), which keeps $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ low $(\sim 15 \mathrm{mM})$ and $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ high $(\sim 120 \mathrm{mM})$. Because the basolateral membrane is primarily permeable to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, it develops a voltage of $\sim 70 \mathrm{mV}$, with the cell interior negative with respect to the interstitial space. Across the apical membrane, the cell is negative with respect to the lumen. The magnitude of the apical membrane voltage may be either lower or higher than that of the basolateral membrane, depending on the nephron segment and its transport activity.

Paracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Reabsorption The basic mechanism of paracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport is similar among nephron segments: the transepithelial electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ drives transport. However, both the transepithelial voltage $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ and luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$vary along the nephron (Table 35-1). As a result, the net driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is positive-favoring passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption-only in the S 2 and S 3 segments of the proximal tubule and in the TAL. In the other segments, the net driving force is negative-favoring passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diffusion from blood to lumen ("backleak"). In addition to undergoing purely passive, paracellular reabsorption in the S 2 and S 3 segments and TAL, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$can move uphill from lumen to blood via solvent drag across the tight junctions. In this case, the movement of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ from the lumen to the lateral intercellular space-energized by the active transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the lateral intercellular space-also sweeps $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in the same direction.

Nephron segments also vary in their leakiness to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions. This leakiness is largely a function of the varying ionic conductance of the paracellular pathway between cells across the tight junction, due to the expression of different claudins. In general, the leakiness of the paracellular pathway decreases along the nephron from the proximal tubule (the most leaky) to the papillary collecting ducts. However, even the tightest renal epithelia have what might be regarded as only a moderate degree of tightness compared with truly "tight" epithelia, such as in those the skin, the gastric mucosa, and the urinary bladder (see pp. 136-137).

The leakiness of an epithelium has serious repercussions for the steepness of the ion gradients that the epithelium can develop and maintain. For both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, the ability of specific nephron segments to establish large concentration gradients correlates with the degree of tightness, which limits the backflux of ions between cells. Thus, the luminal fluid attains much lower concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in the distal nephron than it does in the proximal tubule.

An important consequence of a highly leaky paracellular pathway is that it provides a mechanism by which the basolateral membrane voltage can generate a current that flows through the tight junctions and charges up the apical membrane, and vice versa (see Fig. 35-3B). For example, hyperpolarization of the basolateral membrane leads to a hyperpolarization of the apical membrane. A consequence of this paracellular electrical coupling is that the apical membrane of a leaky epithelium, such as the proximal tubule, has a membrane voltage that is negative ( $\sim 67 \mathrm{mV}$ in Fig. $35-3 B$ ) and close to that of the basolateral membrane ( $\sim 70$ mV in Fig. 35-3B), whereas one would expect that, based on the complement of channels and ion gradients at the apical membrane, the apical membrane would have a far less negative voltage. A practical benefit of this crosstalk is that it helps couple the activity of the basolateral electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump to the passive entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the apical membrane. If the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump rate increases, not only does $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ decrease, enhancing the chemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the apical membrane, but also the basolateral membrane hyperpolarizes (i.e., the cell becomes more negative with respect to the blood). Electrical coupling translates this basolateral hyperpolarization to a concomitant apical hyperpolarization, thus also enhancing the electrical gradient favoring apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry.

## $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$AND $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, AND WATER TRANSPORT AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVEL

## $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption involves apical transporters or ENaCs and a basolateral Na-K pump

Proximal Tubule Along the first half of the tubule (Fig. 35-4A), a variety of cotransporters in the apical membrane couples the downhill uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the uphill uptake of solutes such as glucose, amino acids, phosphate, sulfate, lactate, and citrate. Many of these $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven cotransporters are electrogenic, carrying net positive charge into the cell. Thus, both the low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and the negative apical membrane voltage fuel the secondary active uptake of these other solutes, which we discuss in Chapter 36. In addition to being coupled to the cotransporters, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry is also coupled to the extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$through the electroneutral Na-H
exchanger 3 (NHE3). We discuss the role of NHE3 in renal acid secretion on page 827 .

Both cotransporters and exchangers exploit the downhill $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the apical cell membrane that is established by the Na-K pump in the basolateral membrane. The Na-K pump-and, to a lesser extent, the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter 1 (NBCe1)-are also responsible for the second step in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, moving $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from cell to blood. The presence of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the basolateral membrane is important for two reasons. First, these channels establish the negative voltage across the basolateral membrane and establish a similar negative voltage across the apical membrane via paracellular electrical coupling. Second, these channels permit the recycling of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that had been transported into the cell by the Na-K pump.

Figure 35-3 Transcellular and paracellular mechanisms of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption. The example in B illustrates the electrochemical driving forces for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the early proximal tubule. The equivalent circuit demonstrates that the flow of positive charge across the apical membrane slightly depolarizes the apical membrane $(-67 \mathrm{mV})$ relative to the basolateral membrane $(-70 \mathrm{mV})$.

to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, approximately one third of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that is transported from lumen to blood by the transcellular pathway diffuses back to the lumen by the paracellular pathway ("backleak").

Thin Limbs of Henle's Loop $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport by the thin descending and thin ascending limbs of Henle's loop is almost entirely passive and paracellular (see p. 811).

Thick Ascending Limb Two major pathways contribute to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the TAL: transcellular and paracellular (see Fig. 35-4B). The transcellular pathway includes two major mechanisms for taking up $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the apical membrane. $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter 2 (NKCC2) couples the inward movement of $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 1 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$, and $2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions in an electroneutral process driven by the downhill concentration gradients of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(see p. 122). The second entry pathway
for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is an NHE3. As in the proximal tubule, the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump keeps $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, low and moves $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the blood.

Two features of the apical step of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the TAL are noteworthy. First, the loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide and bumetanide) inhibit $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport. Second, a large fraction of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that NKCC2 brings into the cell recycles to the lumen via apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. These channels are essential for replenishing luminal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and thus for maintaining adequate $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport.

A key aspect of the paracellular pathway for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the TAL is a lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{sc}}$ (see Fig. 35-4B). Nearly all other epithelia have a lumen-negative $V_{\mathrm{sc}}$ because the apical membrane voltage is less negative than the basolateral membrane voltage (see Fig. 5-20B). The TAL is just the opposite. Its lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{sc}}$ develops because of a substantial difference in the ion permeabilities of the apical

![bo4721257579](bo4721257579.jpg)

Figure 35-4 Cell models of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. PCT, proximal convoluted tube.
and basolateral membranes. The apical membrane is $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ selective, so that the apical membrane potential depends mainly on the cell-to-lumen $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$gradient. In contrast, the TAL basolateral membrane is permeable to both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Hence, the basolateral membrane potential lies between the equilibrium potentials of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(approximately -50 mV ) and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(approximately -90 mV ), so that it is less negative than if the basolateral membrane were permeable only to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Because the apical membrane potential is more negative than the basolateral membrane potential, the $V_{\mathrm{to}}$ is lumen positive. (○) N37-9 Because the TAL has a low water permeability, removing luminal NaCl leaves the remaining tubule fluid hypo-osmotic. Hence, the TAL is sometimes referred to as the diluting segment.

The lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{to}}$ provides the driving force for the diffusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the tight junctions, accounting for approximately half of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the TAL. The lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{to}}$ also drives the passive reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (see p. 798), $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see p. 787), and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (see p. 791) via the paracellular pathway.

Distal Convoluted Tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the DCT occurs almost exclusively by the transcellular route (see Fig. $35-4 C$ ). The apical step of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$uptake is mediated by an electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NCC; see p. 123) that
belongs to the same family as NKCC2 in the TAL. However, the NCC differs from NKCC2 in being independent of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and highly sensitive to thiazide diuretics. Although the thiazides produce less diuresis than do the loop diuretics, the thiazides are nevertheless effective in removing excess $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ from the body. The basolateral step of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, as in other cells, is mediated by the Na-K pump. Because the DCT, like the TAL, has a low water permeability, removing luminal NaCl leaves the remaining tubule fluid even more hypo-osmotic. Hence, the DCT is also part of the "diluting segment."

Initial and Cortical Collecting Tubules $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the connecting tubule, initial collecting tubule (ICT), and CCT is transcellular and mediated by the majority cell type, the principal cell (see Fig. 35-4D). The neighboring $\beta$-intercalated cells are important for reabsorbing $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, as discussed below. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$crosses the apical membrane of the principal cell via the epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel (ENaC; see Table $6-2$, family No. 14), which is distinct from the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels expressed by excitable tissues (see p. 187). ENaC is a trimer comprising homologous $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ subunits, each of which has two membrane-spanning segments. This channel is unique in that low levels of the diuretic drug amiloride specifically block it. This compound is a relatively

mild diuretic because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption along the collecting duct is modest. $\Theta 23-14$ The basolateral step of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption is mediated by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, which also provides the electrochemical driving force for the apical entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

The unique transport properties of the apical and basolateral membranes of the principal cells are also the basis for the lumen-negative $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ of approximately -40 mV in the CCT (see Table 35-1). In addition to ENaCs, the CCT has both apical and basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which play a key role in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport (see p. 799). The apical entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(which tends to make the lumen negative) and the basolateral exit of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(which tends to make the cell negative) are, in effect, two batteries of identical sign, arranged in series. In principle, these two batteries could add up to a $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ of -100 mV (lumen negative). However, under most conditions, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit from cell to lumen partially opposes the lumen-negative potential generated by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry. The net effect of these three batteries is a $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ of approximately -40 mV (lumen negative).

The $V_{\text {te }}$ of the CCT can fluctuate considerably, particularly because of changes in the apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$battery owing to, for example, changes in luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. In addition, changing levels of aldosterone or AVP may modulate the number of ENaCs that are open in the apical membrane and thus may affect the relative contribution of this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$battery to apical membrane voltage.

Medullary Collecting Duct The inner and outer medullary collecting ducts reabsorb only a minute amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \sim 3 \%$ of the filtered load (see Fig. 35-2). It is likely that ENaC mediates the apical entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in these segments and that the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump extrudes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the cell across the basolateral membrane (see Fig. 35-4D).

## $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption involves both paracellular and transcellular pathways

Most of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is reabsorbed with $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. However, the segmental handling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$differs somewhat from that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Both transcellular and paracellular pathways participate in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption.

Proximal Tubule The proximal tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by both the transcellular and the paracellular routes, with the paracellular believed to be the dominant one in the early proximal tubule (Fig. 35-5A). The transcellular pathway is more appreciable in the late proximal tubule (see Fig. 35-5B), where the energetically uphill influx of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical membrane occurs via an exchange of luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for cellular anions (e.g., formate, oxalate, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$), mediated at least in part by the anion exchanger SLC26A6. Cl-base exchange is an example of tertiary active transport: the apical NHE3, itself a secondary active transporter (see p. 115), provides the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that neutralizes base in the lumen, thereby sustaining the gradient for Cl -anion exchange. The basolateral exit step for transcellular $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$movement may occur in part via a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel that is analogous in function to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; see p. 120). In addition, the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule expresses $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporters (KCC1, KCC3, KCC4), which are in the same family as the NKCCs and NCCs.

Passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption via the paracellular pathway is driven by different electrochemical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$gradients in the early versus the late proximal tubule. The S 1 segment initially has no $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$concentration gradient between lumen and blood. However, the lumen-negative $V_{\text {te }}$ (see Table 35-1)generated by electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose and $\mathrm{Na} /$ amino-acid cotransport-establishes a favorable electrical gradient for passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption. Solvent drag also makes a contribution in the S1 segment. Preferential $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption in the S2 and S3 portions of the proximal tubule leaves $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$behind (see p. 825), so that $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$in the lumen becomes higher than that in the blood (Fig. 35-6). This favorable lumen-to-blood chemical gradient of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$provides a driving force for its passive paracellular reabsorption in the late proximal tubule, and generates a lumen-positive $V_{\text {te }}$ (see Table 35-1) that drives a component of passive paracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption.

The upper part of Figure 35-6 shows the profile of the ratio of concentration of various solutes X in tubule fluid versus plasma $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{X} / \mathrm{P}_{X}\right.$; see p. 733) for the major solutes in tubule fluid along the proximal tubule. Only minor changes occur in the TF/P for osmolality $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{Osm}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}\right)$ or $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{Na}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Na}}$. Because the tubule does not reabsorb inulin, the substantial increase in $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{la}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{la}}$ indicates net fluid reabsorption. The fall in $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$mirrors an increase in $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{Cl}} / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ because the tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$more rapidly than it does $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. The early proximal tubule avidly reabsorbs glucose and amino acids, which leads to sharp decreases in the concentrations of these substances in the tubule fluid.

An important characteristic of the proximal tubule is that the $V_{\text {te }}$ reverses polarity between the S 1 and the S 2 segments (see Fig. 35-6, lower panel). The early proximal tubule is lumen negative because it reabsorbs $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrogenically, via both electrogenic apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transporters (e.g., $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter) and the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The late proximal tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$at a lower rate. Moreover, because $\mathrm{TF}_{\mathrm{Cl}}$ is greater than $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Cl}}$, the paracellular diffusion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from lumen to blood generates a lumen-positive $V_{\text {te }}$ that facilitates passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption via the same paracellular route as discussed above.

Thick Ascending Limb $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption in the TAL takes place largely by $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport across the apical membrane (see Fig. 35-5C), as we already noted in our discussion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (see Fig. 35-4B). The exit of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the basolateral cell membrane via $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels of the ClC family (see Table 6-2, family No. 16) overwhelms any entry of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$via the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger. You may recall that only half of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the TAL is transcellular, whereas all $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption is transcellular. Overall, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption are identical because the apical NKCC2 cotransporter moves two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for each $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

Distal Convoluted Tubule $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption by the DCT (see Fig. 35-5D) occurs by a mechanism that is somewhat similar to that in the TAL, except the apical step occurs via NCC, as discussed above in connection with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the DCT (see Fig. 35-4C). $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels that are probably similar to those in the TAL mediate the basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exit step.

Collecting Ducts The ICT and the CCT reabsorb $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$by two mechanisms. First, the principal cell generates a $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ ( 40 mV , lumen negative) that is favorable for paracellular diffusion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(see Fig. 35-5E). Second, the $\beta$-type intercalated cells reabsorb $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$via a transcellular process in which pendrin (SLC26A4; see pp. 124-125) mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake across the
apical membrane in exchange for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exits via channels in the basolateral membrane (see Fig. 35-5F). Moreover, two cycles of $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange via pendrin may operate in parallel with one cycle of Na-dependent $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange via NDCBE (see p. 124) to produce net electroneutral NaCl entry across the apical membrane of

## Water reabsorption is passive and secondary to solute transport

Proximal Tubule If water reabsorption by the proximal tubule were to follow solute reabsorption passively, then one would expect the osmolality inside the peritubular capillaries to be greater than that in the luminal fluid. Indeed, investigators have found that the lumen is slightly hypo-osmotic.

If, conversely, proximal-tubule water reabsorption were active, one might expect it to be independent of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. Actually, the opposite was found by Windhager and colleagues in 1959. Using the stationary microperfusion technique, (5) N33-5 these investigators introduced solutions having various $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$values into the proximal-tubule lumen, and they kept luminal osmolality constant by adding mannitol (which is poorly reabsorbed). Because these experiments were performed on amphibian proximal tubules, the maximal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$was only 100 mM , the same as that in blood plasma. After a known time interval, they measured the volume of fluid remaining in the tubule lumen and calculated the rate of fluid reabsorption $\left(J_{V}\right)$. They also measured the $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$of the luminal fluid and calculated the rate of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption $\left(J_{\mathrm{Na}}\right)$. These experiments showed that both

Figure 35-7 Isosmotic water reabsorption in the proximal tubule. $J_{V}$ and $J_{\mathrm{Na}}$ are the rates of fluid (or volume) and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, respectively, in stationary microperfusion experiments.
$J_{V}$ and $J_{\mathrm{Na}}$ are directly proportional to the initial luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$(Fig. 35-7). Moreover, the ratio $J_{\mathrm{Na}} / J_{V}$ is constant and equal to the osmolality of the lumen, which indicates that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and secretion are approximately isosmotic. (5) N35-1

Windhager and colleagues also found that at a luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$of 100 mM , the $J_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $J_{V}$ were large and in the reabsorptive direction. When luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$was only 65 mM , both $J_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $J_{V}$ were zero. At lower luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$values, both $J_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and $J_{V}$ reversed (i.e., the tubule secreted both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water). At these low luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$values, active transcellular movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from lumen to blood cannot overcome the increasing paracellular backleak of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, which results in net secretion of an isosmotic NaCl solution. This experiment shows that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$can move uphill from lumen to blood as long as the opposing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient is not too steep, and also suggests that the movement of water is not active but passively follows the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

If water movement is passive, why is the difference in osmolality so small between the proximal-tubule lumen and blood? The answer is that, because the water permeability of the proximal-tubule epithelium to water is so high, the osmolality gradient needed to generate the observed passive reabsorption of water is only 2 to 3 mOsm . A somewhat greater osmolality gradient probably exists between the lumen and an inaccessible basolateral compartment comprising the lateral intercellular space and the microscopic unstirred layer that surrounds the highly folded basolateral membrane of the proximal-tubule cell.

The pathway for water movement across the proximaltubule epithelium appears to be a combination of

## BOX 35-1 Osmotic Diuresis

Normally, luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$does not change along the proximal tubule. The only exception is osmotic diuresis, a state in which poorly permeable substances are present in the plasma and, therefore, in the glomerular filtrate. Examples are the infusion of sucrose and mannitol. Another is untreated diabetes mellitus (see Box 51-5), when the blood glucose level exceeds the capacity of renal tubules to reabsorb the highly elevated glucose load. Glucose then acts as a poorly reabsorbed substance and as an osmotic diuretic. Because the proximal tubule must reabsorb isosmotic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ salts from a luminal mixture of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$salts and poorly reabsorbable solutes (e.g., mannitol), luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$progressively falls and luminal [mannitol] rises, but luminal osmolality does not change (Fig. 35-8). Because the net rate of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid reabsorption falls as the luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$falls (see Fig. 35-7), the proximal tubule-with rising luminal [mannitol]-reabsorbs progressively less $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid as the fluid travels along the tubule. This decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water reabsorption leaves a larger volume of tubule fluid behind, thereby producing osmotic diuresis.

Osmotic diuresis is of clinical use in several settings. For example, mannitol osmotically draws water out of brain tissue into the vascular system, for ultimate excretion by the kidneys. For this reason, osmotic diuresis is sometimes used in treating patients with acutely increased intracranial pressure from cerebral edema (e.g., from an embolic stroke), an expanding tumor or abscess, hematoma, or hemorrhage. In patients with severe hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, pronounced osmotic diuresis can lead to a potentially life-threatening depletion of ECF volume.

It is common to distinguish between two types of diuresis, solute and water diuresis. The foregoing example of solute or osmotic diuresis is characterized by excretion of a larger-than-normal volume of urine that is rich in solutes. In contrast, water diuresis leads to excretion of larger-than-normal volumes of urine that is poor in solutes.
transcellular and paracellular transit, with the transcellular route dominating. The reason for the high rate of water movement through the proximal-tubule cell is the presence of a high density of aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channels in both the apical and basolateral membranes. Indeed, in the AQP1-null mouse, the rates of solute and fluid reabsorption are reduced, and the fluid that the proximal tubule reabsorbs becomes hyperosmotic compared to normal conditions, resulting in marked luminal hypo-osmolality.

Loop of Henle and Distal Nephron Two features distinguish water and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport in the distal nephron. First, the TAL and all downstream segments have a relatively low water permeability in the absence of AVP (or antidiuretic hormone). We discuss the upregulation of this water permeability by AVP on pages 817-818. Second, the combination of NaCl reabsorption and low water permeability allows these nephron segments to generate a low luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and osmolality with respect to the surrounding interstitial fluid. Given this large osmotic gradient across the epithelium, the distal nephron is poised to reabsorb water passively from a hypo-osmotic luminal fluid into the isosmotic blood when AVP increases the water permeability (Box 35-1).
![bo5621257579](bo5621257579.jpg)

Figure 35-8 Osmotic diuresis and luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$along the proximal tubule. In this example, blood and glomerular filtrate both contain 40 mM mannitol and have an osmolality of 300 mOsm . The isosmotic reabsorption of NaCl (but not mannitol) from proximal-tubule lumen to blood causes luminal [mannitol] to rise and [NaCl] to fall, but causes no change in luminal osmolality. Once luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$falls sufficiently, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$backleak from peritubular capillaries balances active $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, and net reabsorption of NaCl and water is zero. The absence of fluid absorption after this point causes osmotic diuresis. Viewed another way, the rising luminal [mannitol], with the osmotically obligated water the mannitol holds in the lumen, produces the diuresis. $\mathrm{TF}_{34} \mathrm{P}_{34}$, the ratio of inulin concentrations in the tubule fluid to that in plasma.

## The kidney's high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption reflects a high level of active $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport

Because virtually all $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport ultimately depends on the activity of the ATP-driven $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and, therefore, on the generation of ATP by oxidative metabolism, it is not surprising that renal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption is large and parallels $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. Despite their low weight ( $<0.5 \%$ of body

weight), the kidneys are responsible for $7 \%$ to $10 \%$ of total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption. Although it would seem that the high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption would necessitate a large arteriovenous difference in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, the renal blood flow is so large that the arteriovenous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ difference is actually much smaller than that in cardiac muscle or brain.

If one varies $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption experimentally and measures renal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption, the result is a straight-line relationship (Fig. 35-9). However, the kidneys continue to consume a modest but significant amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ even in the complete absence of net $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. This transportindependent component reflects the basic metabolic needs for the maintenance of cell viability.

## REGULATION OF $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$AND $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$TRANSPORT

The body regulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion by three major mechanisms:

1. Changes in renal hemodynamics alter the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load presented to the kidney and regulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the proximal tubule and distal nephron. We discuss these hemodynamic effects in the next four sections.
2. Three factors that respond to decreases in "effective circulating volume"-the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, renal sympathetic nerve activity, and AVP (see pp. 554-555)-do so in part by increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in various nephron segments. We discuss these factors in the fifth section.
3. Several factors that respond to increases in effective circulating volume-including atrial natriuretic peptide and dopamine-do so in part by reducing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in various segments of the nephron. That is, they produce a natriuresis. We discuss these factors in the final section of this chapter.

Figure 35-10 Constancy of fractional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the proximal tubule.

## Glomerulotubular balance stabilizes fractional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption by the proximal tubule in the face of changes in the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load

When hemodynamic changes (e.g., caused by a high-protein diet, intense exercise, severe pain, or anesthesia) alter GFR and thus the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load presented to the nephron, proximal tubules respond by reabsorbing a relatively constant fraction of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load. This constancy of fractional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption along the proximal tubule-glomerulotubular (GT) balance-is independent of external neural and hormonal control, and prevents spontaneous fluctuations in GFR from causing marked changes in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion.

Figure 35-10 shows how the absolute reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$increases proportionally with increases in the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load, achieved by varying GFRs at constant plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. The amount of luminal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$remaining at the end of the proximal tubule also increases linearly with the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load. However, fractional reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water in the proximal tubule is not always constant-that is, proximal GT balance is not always perfect-as we will see below. Moreover, at the level of the whole kidney, GT balance is not perfect, mainly because distal-nephron $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is under neural and hormonal control (see p. 765).

## The proximal tubule achieves GT balance by both peritubular and luminal mechanisms

How do the proximal-tubule cells sense that the GFR has changed? Both peritubular and luminal control mechanisms contribute, although no agreement exists concerning their relative roles.

Peritubular Factors in the Proximal Tubule As discussed in Chapter 34, Starling forces across the peritubular capillary walls determine the uptake of interstitial fluid and thus the net reabsorption of NaCl and fluid from the tubule lumen into the peritubular capillaries (see pp. 747-749). These peritubular physical factors also play a role in GT balance. We can distinguish a sequence of three transport steps as reabsorbed fluid moves from the tubule lumen into the blood (Fig. 35-11A):

![bo5921257579](bo5921257579.jpg)

Figure 35-11 Peritubular mechanisms of GT balance. In $\mathbf{A}, P_{P C}$ and $\pi_{P C}$ are, respectively, the hydrostatic and the oncotic pressures in the peritubular capillaries. At the level of the tubule, the net $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption is the difference between active transcellular transport and passive backleak through the paracellular pathway. At the level of the peritubular capillary, net fluid absorption is the difference between fluid absorption (driven by $\pi_{P C}$ ) and fluid filtration (driven by $P_{P C}$ ). In $\mathbf{B}$, increasing the filtered fraction has effects on both the tubule and the peritubular capillaries. At the level of the tubule, the increased concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled solutes (e.g., glucose) increase active transport. At the level of the capillaries, the lower $P_{P C}$ and higher protein concentration ( $\pi_{P C}$ ) pull more fluid from the interstitium. The net effect is reduced passive backleak.

Step 1: Solutes and water enter a tubule cell across the apical membrane.
Step 2: Solutes and water from step 1 (i.e., "reabsorbate") exit the tubule cell across the basolateral membrane and enter an intercellular compartment-the lateral interspacethat is bounded by the apical tight junction, the basolateral tubule-cell membranes, and a basement membrane that does not discriminate between solutes and solvent. Steps 1 and 2 constitute the transcellular pathway.
Step 3: The reabsorbate can either backleak into the lumen (step 3a) or move sequentially into the interstitial space and then into the blood (step 3b).

At normal GFR (see Fig. 35-11A), reabsorptive Starling forces-the low hydrostatic and high oncotic pressure in the
capillaries-cause an extensive uptake of reabsorbate into the capillaries.

Because of GT balance, spontaneous alterations in GFR lead to changes in peritubular pressures (both hydrostatic and oncotic) that, in turn, modulate the forces that govern step 3. Peritubular mechanisms of GT balance come into play only when the changes in GFR are associated with alterations in filtration fraction ( $\mathrm{FF}=\mathrm{GFR} /[$ renal plasma flow]; see p. 746). Consider an example in which we increase GFR at constant glomerular plasma flow, thereby increasing FF (see Fig. 35-11B). We can produce this effect by increasing efferent arteriolar resistance while concomitantly decreasing afferent arteriolar resistance (see Fig. 34-8A, bottom section). The result is an increase in glomerular capillary pressure (i.e., net filtration pressure) without a change in overall arteriolar

resistance. These changes have two important consequences for peritubular capillaries. First, the increased GFR translates into less fluid remaining in the efferent arteriole, so that peritubular oncotic pressure $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}\right)$ rises. Second, the increased GFR also translates to slightly less blood flowing into the efferent arteriole, which slightly decreases hydrostatic pressure in the peritubular capillaries $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PC}}\right)$. As a consequence, the net driving force increases for the transport of fluid from the lateral interspace into the capillaries; this results in a more effective absorption of fluid and NaCl . The opposite sequence of events occurs with a spontaneous fall in GFR, which leads to a decrease in FF. The response is a decrease in the net reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water by the proximal tubule that tends to maintain constancy of fractional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption and GT balance.

Luminal Factors in the Proximal Tubule Luminal factors also contribute to GT balance, as evidenced by the observation that increased flow along the proximal tubule-without any peritubular effects-leads to an increase in fluid and NaCl reabsorption. The luminal concentrations of solutes such as glucose, amino acids, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$fall along the length of the proximal tubule as the tubule reabsorbs these solutes (see Fig. 35-6). Increasing luminal flow would, for instance, cause luminal [glucose] to fall less steeply along the tubule length, and more glucose would be available for reabsorption at distal sites along the proximal tubule. The net effect is that, integrated over the entire proximal tubule, higher luminal flows increase the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, glucose, and other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled solutes.

A second luminal mechanism may revolve around flow sensing. Increased flow may cause increased bending of the central cilium or the microvilli on the apical membrane, which may signal increased fluid reabsorption. Third, humoral factors in the glomerular filtrate may also contribute to GT balance. If one harvests tubule fluid and injects it into a single proximal tubule, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption increases. Angiotensin II (ANG II)-a small peptide hormone that is both filtered in the glomeruli and secreted by proximaltubule cells-increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

## ECF volume contraction or expansion upsets GT balance

As noted above, proximal GT balance is not always perfect. For instance, if excessive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$loss (e.g., sweating or diarrhea) contracts the ECF volume-thereby reducing renal perfusion pressure, GFR, and the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load-perfect GT balance would reduce renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water excretion. In fact, in volume contraction, the fractional reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and water increases in the proximal tubule, so that renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and water excretion fall beyond that expected for perfect GT balance. Conversely, if ingestion or administration of a high $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load expands ECF, fractional reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water in the proximal tubule falls, which enhances renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ excretion beyond that expected for perfect GT balance. These effects result, in part, from the same hemodynamic factors maintaining GT balance, as well as from direct regulation of transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the proximal tubule.

During ECF and plasma volume contraction, blood pressure and renal blood flow will tend to fall. Under these conditions, prostaglandins mediate afferent arteriolar dilation (see p. 753) and ANG II mediates efferent arteriolar constriction (see p. 752), thereby preventing GFR from falling in proportion to the reduction in renal blood flow. Thus, FF will increase. The resulting increase in peritubular protein concentration will raise peritubular oncotic pressure $\left(\pi_{\mathrm{PC}}\right)$, reducing backleak of reabsorbate and thereby enhancing net tubule reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$salts and water. In addition, ANG II—levels of which increase during volume contractionbinds to $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptors on proximal-tubule cells, which results in stimulation of transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. The converse series of events will take place during volume expansion.

## The distal nephron also increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in response to an increased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load

The tubules of the distal nephron, like their proximal counterparts, also increase their absolute magnitude of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in response to increased flow and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery. The principle is the same as that for glucose transport in the proximal tubule, except here it is luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$that falls less steeply when flow increases (Fig. 35-12A). Because the transport mechanisms responsible for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the distal nephron are more effective at higher luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$ values, reabsorption at any site increases with flow (see Fig. 35-12B). In contrast to GT balance in the proximal tubule, increasing flow by a factor of 4 in the distal nephron may cause cumulative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption to rise by only a factor of 2 (see Fig. 35-12C).

The load dependence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the TAL is of clinical importance because it explains why diuretic agents acting on the proximal tubule are relatively less effective in enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion than one would expect from the large fraction of filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that the proximal tubule reabsorbs. Thus, although carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are potent blockers of proximal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water reabsorption, the increased delivery of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the TAL and distal nephron results in a large increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in these segments, greatly reducing the ultimate loss of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the final urine.

## Four parallel pathways that regulate effective circulating volume all modulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption

GT balance is only one element in a larger, complex system for controlling $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance. As we see in Chapter 40, the control of effective circulating volume (i.e., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content) is under the powerful control of four parallel effectors (see pp. 554-555): the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, the sympathetic nervous system, AVP, and atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). In Chapter 34 we saw how these factors modulate renal blood flow and GFR (see pp. 752-753). Here, we briefly discuss how these four effectors modulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption, a subject that we will treat more comprehensively beginning on page 836 .

Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone Axis ANG II-the second element in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (see

![bo6021257579](bo6021257579.jpg)
pp. 841-842)-binds to $\mathrm{AT}_{1}$ receptors at the apical and basolateral membranes of proximal-tubule cells and, predominantly via protein kinase C, stimulates NHE3. ANG II also upregulates expression of NHE3 and NKCC2 in the TAL. Moreover, ANG II upregulates NCC activity in the DCT and stimulates apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the ICT. These effects promote $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. Complex interactions among intracellular kinases (e.g., WNK4 and SPAK) mediate the effects of ANG II on the DCT and ICT.

Aldosterone-the final element in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone axis-stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by NCC in the DCT and by the ENaC in the late DCT, connecting tubule, and collecting ducts. Normally, $<10 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load is under humoral control by aldosterone. Nevertheless, the sustained loss of even a small fraction of the filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load would exceed the daily $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake significantly. Accordingly, the lack of aldosterone that occurs in adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) can lead to severe $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$depletion, contraction of the ECF volume, low plasma volume, and hypotension. (1) N35-2

Aldosterone acts on its target tissues by binding to cytoplasmic mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs) that then translocate to the nucleus and upregulate transcription (see pp. 71-72), as illustrated for the case of principal cells of the collecting ducts in Figure 35-13A. Thus, the effects of aldosterone require a few hours to manifest themselves because they depend on the increased production of aldosteroneinduced proteins. The ultimate cellular actions of aldosterone include upregulation of apical ENaCs, apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, and mitochondrial metabolism. The effects on ENaC involve an increase in the product of channel number in the apical membrane and open probability $\left(N P_{o}\right)$, and thus apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$permeability. The simultaneous activation of apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry and basolateral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion ensures that, even with very high levels of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and cell volume are stable. Longterm exposure to aldosterone leads to the targeting of newly synthesized $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps to the basolateral membrane and to amplification of the basolateral membrane area.

Aldosterone upregulates serum- and glucocorticoidinduced kinase (SGK), which phosphorylates and thereby inhibits the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (see Fig. 35-13B). The net effect is reduced ubiquitination-and thus reduced endocytosis of ENaC-and increased apical membrane abundance of ENaC.

Because MRs distinguish poorly between glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, and because plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids greatly exceed those of aldosterone, one would expect glucocorticoids to exert a mineralocorticoid effect and cause $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention. Under normal conditions, this does not happen because of the enzyme $\mathbf{1 1 \beta}$ hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11 $\beta$-HSD2), (1) N35-3 which colocalizes with intracellular MRs (see Fig. 35-13C). This enzyme irreversibly converts cortisol into cortisone (see p. 1021), an inactive metabolite with low affinity for MRs. In sharp contrast, the enzyme does not metabolize aldosterone. Thus, $11 \beta$-HSD2 enhances the apparent specificity of MRs by protecting them from illicit occupancy by cortisol. As may be expected, an $11 \beta$-HSD2 deficiency may cause apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME), with abnormal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ retention, hypokalemia, and hypertension. Carbenoxolone, a specific inhibitor of $11 \beta$-HSD2, prevents metabolism of cortisol in target cells, thus permitting abnormal activation of MRs by this glucocorticoid. Another inhibitor of $11 \beta$ HSD2 is glycyrrhetinic acid, a component of "natural" licorice (see Fig. 35-13D). (1) N35-4 Thus, natural licorice can also cause the symptoms of AME.

Sympathetic Division of the Autonomic Nervous System Sympathetic nerve terminals in the kidney release norepinephrine, which has two major direct effects on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption. First, high levels of sympathetic stimulation markedly reduce renal blood flow and, therefore, GFR (see p. 752). A decreased filtered load of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$will tend to cause $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion to fall. Second, even low levels of sympathetic stimulation activate $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors in proximal tubules. This activation stimulates both the apical NHE3 and basolateral Na-K pump (see Fig. 35-4A), thereby

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

Refer to Figure 50-2, specifically the cortisol molecule (4-pregnen-11 $\beta, 17 \alpha, 21$-triol-3,20-dione), which has two highlighted hydroxyl groups-one on the C ring at position 11 and another on the D ring at position 17. The enzyme $11 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $11 \beta$-HSD) removes one $H$ from the hydroxyl group at position 11 and another $H$ from the same carbon, yielding a ketone group $(\mathrm{O}=\mathrm{C})$ at position 11. The product of this reaction is cortisone (4-pregnen-17 $\alpha, 21$ -diol-3,11,20-trione). Thus, the enzyme converts a triol (three hydroxyl groups)/dione (two ketone groups) to a diol (two hydroxyl groups)/trione (three ketone groups).

## N35-4 Licorice as a Cause of Apparent Mineralocorticoid Excess

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Glycyrrhizic acid is a chemical that consists of glycyrrhetinic acid (3- $\beta$-hydroxy-11-oxoolean-12-en-30-oic acid) conjugated to two glucuronic acid moieties. Glycyrrhizic acid is 150 -fold sweeter than sucrose. It is naturally produced by the plant Glycyrrhiza glabra (Leguminosae) and is also present in European licorice. American licorice manufacturers generally substitute anise for glycyrrhizic acid.

Glycyrrhetinic acid and the glycyrrhetinic acid moiety of glycyrrhizic acid have the curious property that they inhibit the enzyme 11 $\beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11 $\beta$ HSD). This enzyme converts cortisol into cortisone. N35-3 Because cortisol has a much higher affinity for the MR than does the breakdown product cortisone, inhibition of $11 \beta$ HSD produces the same symptoms as a bona fide excess of mineralocorticoids. As described on page 766, this excess leads to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention and hypertension.

These compounds also inhibit 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase in the surface cells of the stomach and thereby increase levels of prostaglandins that protect the stomach from acid damage. This same action may also promote the release of mucus in the airway, which is why the active compounds of licorice have been used as expectorants.

True licorice has long been used as an herbal medicine.

Arginine Vasopressin (Antidiuretic Hormone) Released by the posterior pituitary, AVP binds to a $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptor at the basolateral membrane of target cells. Acting via $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{s}}$, the AVP increases [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$ (see pp. 56-57). As discussed in Chapter 38, the overall renal effect of AVP in humans is to produce urine with a high osmolality and thereby retain water (see pp. 817-818). However, AVP also stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. In the TAL, AVP stimulates the apical NKCC2 and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Fig. 35-4B). In principal cells of the ICT and CCT, AVP stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport by increasing the number of open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels $\left(\mathrm{NP}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ in the apical membrane. (5) N35-5

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Of the four parallel effectors that control effective circulating volume, ANP (see p. 843) is the only one that promotes natriuresis. A polypeptide released by atrial myocytes (see p. 553), ANP stimulates a receptor guanylyl cyclase to generate cGMP (see p. 66). The major effects of ANP are hemodynamic. (5) N35-6 It causes renal vasodilation by increasing blood flow to both the cortex and the medulla. Increased blood flow to the cortex raises GFR and increases the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load to the proximal tubule and to the TAL (see pp. 752-753). Increased blood flow to the medulla washes out the medullary interstitium (see pp. 813-815), thus decreasing osmolality and ultimately reducing passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the thin ascending limb (see p. 811). The combined effect of increasing cortical and medullary blood flow is to increase the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load to the distal nephron and thus to increase urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. In addition to having hemodynamic effects, ANP directly inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport in the inner medullary collecting duct, perhaps by decreasing the activity of nonselective cation channels in the apical membrane.

## Dopamine, elevated plasma [Ca ${ }^{2+}$ ], an endogenous steroid, prostaglandins, and bradykinin all decrease $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption

Aside from ANP (see previous section), five humoral agents have significant natriuretic action, in part due to inhibition of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption at the level of the tubule cell.

Dopamine From circulating L-dopa, proximal-tubule cells use L-amino acid decarboxylase (see Fig. 13-8C) to form dopamine, which they then secrete into the tubule lumen. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$loading increases the synthesis and urinary excretion rate of dopamine, whereas a low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diet has the opposite effect. As noted above, dopamine causes renal vasodilation (see p. 753), which increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. Dopamine also directly inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption at the level of tubule cells. Indeed, D1 dopamine receptors are present in the renal cortex, where they lead to an increase in [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$. The result is an inhibition of apical NHE3 in the proximal tubule and inhibition of the basolateral Na-K pump in multiple tubule segments. In humans, administering low doses of dopamine leads to natriuresis.

Figure 35-14 Role of CaSR in regulating $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the TAL. AC, adenylyl cyclase.

Elevated Plasma [Ca ${ }^{2+}$ ] The kidney, similar to the parathyroid gland (see pp. 1060-1061), responds directly to changes in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. In the cortical TAL, an increase in basolateral $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ inhibits both the NKCC and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels on the apical membrane (see Fig. 35-4B), thereby decreasing the lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{n}}$, and reducing paracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. The mechanism appears to be the following (Fig. 35-14): Extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to a basolateral $\mathbf{C a}^{2+}$-sensing receptor (CaSR), which couples to at least two G proteins. First, activation of $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{i}$ decreases [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$, thus reducing stimulation of $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport by cAMP (see p. 768). Second, activation of a member of the $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{i}} / \mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{o}}$ family stimulates phospholipase $\mathrm{A}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PLA}_{2}\right.$; see p. 62), thereby increasing levels of arachidonic acid and one of its cytochrome P-450 metabolites, probably 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE). The latter inhibits apical NKCCs and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Third, CaSR activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{o}}$, elevating levels of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and thus $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see p. 58) and also stimulating protein kinase C (PKC; see pp. 60-61), which also inhibits $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport. Regardless of the mechanism, inhibition of apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport (1) lowers $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ and thus hyperpolarizes the basolateral membrane, and (2) lowers $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ and thus depolarizes the apical membrane. Together, these two effects reduce the lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{n}}$, thereby inhibiting the paracellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and, as we shall see below, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see p. 789) and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ (see p. 791). The CaSR is also present in the proximal tubule, the medullary TAL, the DCT, and the collecting ducts. (6) N36-14

As noted in the text, AVP increases the number of open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels $\left(\mathrm{NP}_{\mathrm{n}}\right)$ in the initial and cortical collecting tubules. This effect may reflect fusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel-containing vesicles with the apical cell membrane or activation of pre-existing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the membrane by cAMP-dependent protein kinase.

response to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$loading, the body may increase levels of this inhibitor, which presumably would bind preferentially to $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps of collecting-duct cells, thereby elevating $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ and enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion.

Prostaglandins Produced locally in the kidney, prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{2}\right)$ inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and promotes natriuresis. In the TAL, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ inhibits both apical and basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, depolarizing both membranes and reducing passive $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$efflux across the basolateral membrane. $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ therefore rises, impeding the turnover of the apical NKCC2 (see Fig. 35-4B) and reducing NaCl reabsorption. In addition, the $V_{\mathrm{n}}$ becomes less lumen positive, which decreases the driving force for passive paracellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and other cations. In the CCT, both $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ and bradykinin inhibit electrogenic reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$through principal cells (see Fig. 35-4D). Accordingly, drugs that inhibit prostaglandin synthesis (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs, or NSAIDs) tend to cause $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention, resistance to diuretic drugs, and exacerbation of hypertension in some patients.

Bradykinin In the TAL, bradykinin-also made locally in the kidney-stimulates $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ synthesis and release, which in turn inhibits NaCl reabsorption (see above). Moreover, in the CCT, bradykinin inhibits ENaC activity, thereby reducing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and favoring natriuresis. Because angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) degrades bradykinin, one of the mechanisms by which ACE inhibitors enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion and reduce blood pressure is blocking bradykinin breakdown.

# TRANSPORT OF UREA, GLUCOSE, PHOSPHATE, CALCIUM, MAGNESIUM, AND ORGANIC SOLUTES 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

The kidney plays a central role in controlling the plasma levels of a wide range of solutes that are present at low concentrations in the body. The renal excretion of a solute depends on three processes-filtration, reabsorption, and secretion (see pp. 732-733). The kidney filters and then totally reabsorbs some of the substances we discuss in this chapter (e.g., glucose). Others, it filters and also secretes (e.g., the organic anion para-aminohippurate [PAH]). Still others, the kidney filters, reabsorbs, and secretes (e.g., urea).

## UREA

## The kidney filters, reabsorbs, and secretes urea

The liver generates urea from $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, the primary nitrogenous end product of amino-acid catabolism (see p. 965). The primary route for urea excretion is the urine, although some urea exits the body through the stool and sweat. The normal plasma concentration of urea is 2.5 to 6 mM . Clinical laboratories report plasma urea levels as blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the units (mg of elemental nitrogen)/(dL plasma); normal values are 7 to $18 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$. For a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human ingesting a typical Western diet and producing 1.5 to $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of urine, the urinary excretion of urea is $\sim 450 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day.

The kidney freely filters urea at the glomerulus, and then it both reabsorbs and secretes it. Because the tubules reabsorb more urea than they secrete, the amount of urea excreted in the urine is less than the quantity filtered. In the example shown in Figure 36-1A (i.e., average urine flow), the kidneys excrete $\sim 40 \%$ of the filtered urea. The primary sites for urea reabsorption are the proximal tubule and the medullary collecting duct, whereas the primary sites for secretion are the thin limbs of the loop of Henle.

In the very early proximal tubule (see Fig. 36-1B), [urea] in the lumen is the same as in blood plasma. However, water reabsorption tends to increase [urea] in the lumen, thereby generating a favorable transepithelial gradient that drives urea reabsorption by diffusion via the transcellular or paracellular pathway. In addition, some urea may be reabsorbed by solvent drag (see p. 467) across the tight junctions. The greater the fluid reabsorption along the proximal tubule, the greater the reabsorption of urea via both diffusion and solvent drag.

In more distal urea-permeable nephron segments, urea moves via facilitated diffusion through the urea transporters (UTs). (1) N36-1 The SLC14A2 gene encodes not only UT-A2 but also the splice variants UT-A1 and UT-A3. The prototypical member of the UT family, UT-A2, is a glycosylated $55-\mathrm{kDa}$ integral membrane protein with 10 putative membrane-spanning segments (TMs). UT-A3 also has 10 TMs. The bacterial homolog has three monomers, each of which contains a urea pore, with the pores arranged as a triangle. UT-A1 is a $97-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein with 20 TMs. UT-A1 is basically UT-A3 linked-via an intracellular loop-to UT-A2.

In juxtamedullary nephrons, as the tubule fluid in the thin descending limb (tDLH) approaches the tip of the loop of Henle, [urea] is higher in the medullary interstitium than in the lumen (see pp. 811-813). Thus, the deepest portion of the tDLH secretes urea via facilitated diffusion (see Fig. 36-1C) mediated by the urea transporter UT-A2. As the fluid turns the corner to flow up the thin ascending limb (tALH), the tubule cells continue to secrete urea into the lumen, probably also by facilitated diffusion (see Fig. 36-1D).

The tDLH of superficial nephrons is located in the inner stripe of the outer medulla. Here, the interstitial [urea] is higher than the luminal [urea] because the vasa recta carry urea from the inner medulla. Because the tDLH cells of these superficial nephrons appear to have UT-A2 along their entire length, these cells secrete urea. Thus, both superficial and probably also juxtamedullary nephrons contribute to urea secretion, raising urea delivery to $\sim 110 \%$ of the filtered load at the level of the cortical collecting ducts.

Finally, the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) reabsorbs urea via a transcellular route involving apical and basolateral steps of facilitated diffusion (see Fig. 36-1E). The UT-A1 urea transporter moves urea across the apical membrane of the IMCD cell, whereas UT-A3 probably mediates urea movement across the basolateral membrane. Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-which is also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and acts through cAMP (see p. 57)—stimulates UT-A1 and UT-A3. We discuss the role of urea transport in the urinary concentrating mechanism beginning on page 811 .

UT-B1 and UT-B2, each encoded by SLC14A1, are present in the descending limb of the vasa recta (see p. 814).

# N36-1 Urea Transporters 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

The UTs belong to the SLC14 family of transporters. The family has two gene members, SLC14A1 and SLC14A2. Both mediate facilitated diffusion. That is, the movement of urea is not coupled to that of another solute, but nevertheless exhibits saturation and other hallmarks of carrier-mediated transport.
SLC14A1: This gene has at least two variants: UT-B1 (also known as UT3) and UT-B2 (also known as UT11). These are expressed in the descending vasa recta and red blood cells.
SLC14A2: This gene has at least eight variants: UT-A1 (UT1), UT-A1b, UT-A2 (UT2), UT-A2b, UT-A3 (UT4), UT-A3b, UT-A4, and UT-A5. These are expressed predominantly in the kidney but also in other organs. The putative fundamental topology of a UT protein is 5 membrane-spanning segments (TMs), a large extracellular loop, and an additional 5 TMs (for a total of 10 TMs). Somewhat paradoxically, the UT-A1 variant of SLC14A2-the first UT discovered-is a concatamer or two such units, linked by a long intracellular loop; it therefore has a total of 20 putative TMs.

## Urea excretion rises with increasing urinary flow

Because urea transport depends primarily on urea concentration differences across the tubule epithelium, changes in urine flow unavoidably affect renal urea handling (Fig. 36-2). At low urine flow, when the tubule reabsorbs considerable water and, therefore, much urea, the kidneys excrete only $\sim 15 \%$ of filtered urea (see Fig. 38-5). However, the kidneys may excrete as much as $70 \%$ of filtered urea at high urine flow, when the tubules reabsorb relatively less water and urea. During the progression of renal disease, the decline of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) leads to a low urine flow and urea retention, and thus an increase in BUN.

In clinical conditions such as volume depletion, in which the urine flow declines sharply (see Box 40-1), urea excretion decreases out of proportion to the fall in GFR. The resulting high BUN can thus serve as laboratory confirmation of volume depletion. The flow dependence of urea clearance contrasts with the behavior of creatinine clearance, which, like inulin clearance (see p. 740), is largely independent of urine flow. Consequently, in patients with reduced effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555), and hence low urine flow, the plasma [BUN]/[creatinine] ratio increases from its normal value of $\sim 10$ (both concentrations in $\mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

## GLUCOSE

## The proximal tubule reabsorbs glucose via apical, electrogenic Na/glucose cotransport and basolateral facilitated diffusion

The fasting plasma glucose concentration is normally 4 to 5 mM ( 70 to $100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$; see p. 1038) and is regulated by insulin and other hormones. The kidneys freely filter glucose at the glomerulus and then reabsorb it, so that only trace amounts normally appear in the urine (Fig. 36-3A). The proximal tubule reabsorbs nearly all the filtered load of glucose, mostly along the first third of this segment. More distal segments reabsorb almost all of the remainder. In the proximal tubule, luminal [glucose] is initially equal to plasma [glucose]. As the early proximal tubule reabsorbs glucose,
luminal [glucose] drops sharply, falling to levels far lower than those in the interstitium. Accordingly, glucose reabsorption occurs against a concentration gradient and must, therefore, be active.

Glucose reabsorption is transcellular; glucose moves from the lumen to the proximal tubule cell via $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport, and from cytoplasm to blood via facilitated diffusion (see Fig. 36-3B, C). At the apical membrane, $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporters (SGLT1, SGLT2; see pp. 121-122) couple the movements of the electrically neutral D-glucose (but not L-glucose) and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Phloridzin, extracted from the root bark of certain fruit trees (e.g., cherry, apple), inhibits the SGLTs. The basolateral Na-K pump maintains intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration ( $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ ) lower than that of the tubule fluid. Moreover, the electrically negative cell interior establishes a steep electrical gradient that favors the flux of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ from lumen to cell. Thus, the electrochemical gradient of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ drives the uphill transport of glucose into the cell (i.e., secondary active transport), thereby concentrating glucose in the cytoplasm. (5) N36-2

In the early part of the proximal tubule (S1 segment), a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter called SGLT2 (SLC5A2) mediates apical glucose uptake (see Fig. 36-3B). This cotransporter has an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-to-glucose stoichiometry of $1: 1$ and is responsible for $90 \%$ of the glucose reabsorption. Indeed, SGLT2 inhibitors have recently become available to treat patients with hyperglycemia due to diabetes mellitus. (5) N36-3 In the later part of the proximal tubule (S3 segment), a high-affinity, low-capacity cotransporter called SGLT1 (SLC5A1) is responsible for apical glucose uptake (see Fig. 36-3C). Because this cotransporter has an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-toglucose stoichiometry of $2: 1$ (i.e., far more electrochemical energy per glucose molecule), it can generate a far larger glucose gradient across the apical membrane (see Equation 5-20). Paracellular glucose permeability progressively diminishes along the proximal tubule, which further contributes to the tubule's ability to maintain high transepithelial glucose gradients and to generate near-zero glucose concentrations in the fluid emerging from the proximal tubule.

Once inside the cell, glucose exits across the basolateral membrane via a member of the GLUT (SLC2) family of glucose transporters (see p. 114). These transporters-quite distinct from the SGLTs-are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent and move glucose by facilitated diffusion. Like the apical SGLTs, the basolateral GLUTs differ in early and late proximal-tubule segments, with GLUT2 in the early proximal tubule (see Fig. 36-3B) and GLUT1 in the late proximal tubule (see Fig. 36-3C). In contrast to the apical SGLTs, the basolateral GLUTs have a much lower sensitivity to phloridzin.

## Glucose excretion in the urine occurs only when the plasma concentration exceeds a threshold

The relationship between plasma [glucose] and the rate of glucose reabsorption is the glucose titration curve. Figure $36-4 A$ shows how rates of glucose filtration (orange curve), excretion (green curve), and reabsorption (red curve) vary when plasma [glucose] is increased by infusing intravenous glucose. As plasma [glucose] rises-at constant GFR-from control levels to $\sim 200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, glucose excretion remains zero. It is only above a threshold of $\sim 200 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 11 \mathrm{mM})$

## N36-2 Using Membrane Vesicles to Study Glucose Transport

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

We describe the membrane-vesicle technique in $\mathbf{\$}$ N33-5. Figure 5-12 illustrates the use of this technique to explore how the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient affects glucose uptake. The vesicles are made from brush-border membrane vesicles (i.e., made from the apical membrane of the proximal tubule). In the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the experimental medium, glucose enters renal brush-border membrane vesicles slowly until reaching an equilibrium value (green curve in the central graph of Fig. 5-12). At this point, internal and external glucose concentrations are identical. The slow increase in intravesicular [glucose] occurs by diffusion in the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In contrast, adding $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the external medium establishes a steep inwardly directed Na gradient, which dramatically accelerates glucose uptake (red curve in the central graph of Fig. 5-12). The result is a transient "overshoot" during which glucose accumulates above the equilibrium level. Thus, in the presence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the vesicle clearly transports glucose uphill. Similar gradients of other cations, such as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, have no effect on glucose movement, beyond that expected from diffusion alone.

A negative cell voltage can also drive $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport, even when there is no $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient. In experiments in which the internal and external $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations are the same, making the inside of the vesicles electrically negative accelerates glucose uptake (not shown in Fig. 5-12).

In vesicle experiments performed on vesicles made from the basolateral membrane, the overshoot in intravesicular [glucose] does not occur, even in the presence of an inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient. Thus, the $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter is restricted to the apical membrane.

## N36-3 Clinical Use of SGLT2 Inhibitors

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

SGLT2 inhibitors are novel "glucuretics" that have been approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The lowaffinity, high-capacity cotransporter SGLT2 reabsorbs the bulk of the filtered glucose in the S1/S2 segments of the proximal convoluted tubule, whereas the low-affinity, high-capacity cotransporter SGLT1 in the S3 segment reabsorbs the remainder. Thus, specific SGLT2 inhibition causes the bulk of filtered glucose to be excreted in the urine, whereas about 10\% of filtered glucose is still reabsorbed by SGLT1, so that [glucose] ${ }_{\text {inverse }}$ is prevented from falling below normal. However, in clinical practice, SGLT2 inhibitors inhibit only 30\% to $50 \%$ of renal glucose reabsorption.

Phlorizin, the $2^{\mathrm{e}}$-glucoside of phloretin, is a natural compound in the bark of fruit trees and a competitive inhibitor of both SGLT1 and SGLT2. Before the discovery of insulin, phlorizin was used in the treatment of diabetes, although the compound is poorly absorbed by gastrointestinal tract and not stable. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved two specific SGLT2 inhibitors for oral use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes in adults: canagliflozin and dapagliflozin (Farxiga). Urinary tract infections and genital fungal infections are common adverse effects of this treatment due to chronically high glucose concentration in the urine.

that glucose appears in the urine. Glucose excretion rises linearly as plasma [glucose] increases further. Because the threshold is considerably higher than the normal plasma [glucose] of $\sim 100 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(\sim 5.5 \mathrm{mM})$, and because the body effectively regulates plasma [glucose] (see p. 1038), healthy people do not excrete any glucose in the urine, even after a meal. Likewise, patients with diabetes mellitus, who have chronically elevated plasma glucose concentrations, do not experience glucosuria until the blood sugar level exceeds this threshold value.

The glucose titration curve shows a second property, saturation. The rate of glucose reabsorption reaches a plateau-the transport maximum $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$-at $\sim 400 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$. The reason for the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ value is that the SGLTs now become fully saturated. Therefore, these transporters cannot respond to further increases in filtered glucose.

Figure 36-4A also shows that the rate of glucose reabsorption reaches the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ gradually, not abruptly. This splay in the titration curve probably reflects both anatomical and kinetic differences among nephrons. Therefore, a particular nephron's filtered load of glucose may be mismatched to its capacity to reabsorb glucose. For example, a nephron with a larger glomerulus has a larger load of glucose to reabsorb. Different nephrons may have different distributions and densities of SGLT2 and SGLT1 along the proximal tubule. Accordingly, saturation in different nephrons may occur at different plasma levels. (○) N36-4

At low filtered glucose loads, when no glucose appears in the urine (see Fig. 36-4A), the clearance (see p. 731) of glucose is zero. As the filtered load increases beyond the threshold, and glucose excretion increases linearly with plasma [glucose], the clearance of glucose progressively increases. At extremely high glucose loads, when the amount of glucose reabsorbed becomes small compared with the filtered load, glucose behaves more like inulin (i.e., it remains in the tubule lumen). Thus, if we replot the glucose-excretion data in Figure 36-4A as clearance (i.e., excretion divided by plasma [glucose]), we see that, as the filtered glucose load rises, glucose clearance (○) N36-5 (see Fig. 36-4B, red curve) approaches inulin clearance (orange curve).

The four key characteristics of glucose transport-(1) threshold, (2) saturation $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, (3) splay, and (4) clearance approaching GFR at infinite plasma concentrations-apply to several other solutes as well, including amino acids, organic-anion metabolites (e.g., lactate, citrate, and $\alpha$ ketoglutarate [ $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}]$ ), PAH, and phosphate.

## N36-4 Clinical Correlates of Splay in the Glucose Titration Curve

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Splay can be clinically important. Patients with proximal-tubule disease-mainly of hereditary nature and often observed in children—have a lower threshold, but a normal $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$. Thus, splay is exaggerated, presumably because some individual cotransporters have a low glucose affinity but normal maximal transport rate (see Equation 5-16). This abnormality results in glucose excretion at a lower-than-normal plasma [glucose]. Other patients have a normal threshold but a significantly reduced $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ (primary renal glucosuria). These patients, including those with Fanconi syndrome, have a reduced number of $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporters. Thus, once plasma [glucose] exceeds the threshold, these patients excrete more glucose than normal. In addition, destruction of renal parenchyma by disease processes may diminish the activity of the basolateral Na-K pump and thus reduce the driving force for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the brush-border membrane, resulting in glucosuria.

## N36-5 Glucose Clearance

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As stated in the text, the glucose clearance is zero at plasma glucose values below the threshold and gradually rises as plasma glucose level rises. We can express the excretion of glucose quantitatively at plasma concentrations beyond the threshold, where the glucose reabsorption rate $\left(T_{m}\right)$ has reached its maximum:
![bo7321257579](bo7321257579.jpg)

All three terms in the above equation are plotted in Figure 36-4A. The first term in the equation $\left(\mathrm{U}_{0} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right)$ is represented by the green curve. The second term (GFR $\times \mathrm{P}_{0}$ ) is the yellow curve. The term $\left(T_{0}\right)$ is the red curve. Dividing both sides of the equation by $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ yields the glucose clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{0}\right)$ :

$$
C_{0}=\frac{U_{0} \cdot \dot{V}}{P_{0}} \times G F R-\frac{T_{0}}{P_{0}}
$$

Thus, as plasma [glucose] approaches infinity, the righthand term reduces to GFR, and therefore glucose clearance approaches inulin clearance (see Fig. 36-4B). In patients with an extremely low threshold, (3) N36-4 glucose clearance even more closely approximates GFR.

The glomeruli freely filter amino acids (Fig. 36-5A). Because amino acids are important nutrients, it is advantageous to retrieve them from the filtrate. The proximal tubule reabsorbs $>98 \%$ of these amino acids via a transcellular route, using a wide variety of amino-acid transporters, some of which have overlapping substrate specificity (Table 36-1). At the apical membrane, amino acids enter the cell via $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-driven transporters as well as amino-acid exchangers (see Fig. 36-5B). At the basolateral membrane, amino acids exit the cell via amino-acid exchangers-some of which are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$dependent-and also by facilitated diffusion (see p. 114). Particularly in the late proximal tubule and "postproximal" nephron segments, where the availability of luminal amino acids is low, SLC38A3 mediates the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent uptake of amino acids across the basolateral membrane. This process is important for cellular nutrition or for metabolism. For example, in proximal-tubule cells SLC38A3 takes up glutamine-the precursor for $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$synthesis and gluconeogenesis (see pp. 829-831 and Fig. 39-5A).

For an amino acid to cross the proximal-tubule epithelium, it must move through both an apical and a basolateral transporter (see Table 36-1). For example, glutamate enters the cell across the apical membrane via SLC1A1. This transporter simultaneously takes up $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 36-5B). Inside the cell, glutamate can be metabolized to $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ in the synthesis of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and gluconeogenesis, or it can exit across the basolateral membrane, perhaps by SLC1A4 or SLC1A5. The positively charged lysine and arginine cross the apical membrane in exchange for neutral amino acids, with their movement mediated by the heterodimeric transporter SLC7A9/SLC3A1. This process is driven by the cell-negative voltage and by relatively high intracellular concentrations of the neutral amino acids. Lysine and arginine exit across the basolateral membrane via the electroneutral, heterodimeric transporter SLC7A7/SLC3A2, which simultaneously takes up $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and a neutral amino acid. Neutral amino acids other than proline can cross the apical membrane via SLC6A19, driven by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and exit across the basolateral membrane via the heterodimeric SLC7A8/ SLC3A2, which exchanges neutral amino acids. Neutral aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine can exit by facilitated diffusion, mediated by SLC16A10. Proline enters across the apical membrane together with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$via SLC36A1 and exits across the basolateral membrane via the neutral amino-acid exchanger SLC7A8/SLC3A2.

Because the same carrier can reabsorb structurally similar amino acids, competitive inhibition may occur in the presence of two related amino acids. This effect may explain why the tubules do not fully reabsorb some amino acids (e.g., glycine, histidine, and some nonproteogenic amino acids, such as L-methylhistidine and taurine), even though the transporter itself is normal. Competition can also occur in patients with hyperargininemia (Table 36-2 and Box 36-1).

Apparent competition between transported solutes occurs when they compete for the same energy source. Because the apical uptake of many organic and some inorganic solutes (e.g., phosphate, sulfate) depends on the electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$

gradient, increasing the activity of one such transporter can slow others. For example, glucose uptake via electrogenic Na/glucose cotransport may compromise the reabsorption of some amino acids for two reasons: (1) raising $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$ diminishes the chemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient for other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven transporters, and (2) carrying net positive charge into the cell depolarizes the apical membrane and thus decreases the electrical gradient.

With a few exceptions, the kinetics of amino-acid reabsorption resembles that of glucose: the titration curves show saturation and transport maxima $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{ss}}\right)$. In contrast to the case of glucose, in which the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{ss}}$ is relatively high, the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{ss}}$ values for amino acids are generally low. As a consequence, when plasma levels of amino acids increase, the kidneys excrete the amino acids in the urine, thus limiting the maximal plasma levels.

## An $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-driven cotransporter takes up oligopeptides across the apical membrane, whereas endocytosis takes up proteins and other large organic molecules

Oligopeptides The proximal tubules reabsorb $\sim 99 \%$ of filtered oligopeptides (Fig. 36-6A). Segments beyond the proximal tubule contribute little to peptide transport.

# BOX 36-1 Hyperaminoacidurias 

n general, an increase in the renal excretion of an amino acid (hyperaminoaciduria) may occur when the plasma concentration increases owing to any of several metabolic derangements or when the carrier-mediated reabsorption of the amino acid decreases abnormally.

## Prerenal Hyperaminoacidurias (i.e., the Defect Is Before the Kidney)

Hyperargininemia (see Table 36-2, section A), an inherited condition in which a metabolic defect leads to an increase in plasma arginine (Arg) levels that, in turn, increases the filtered load of Arg. Although the reabsorption of Arg increases, the filtered load exceeds the $T_{m}$, and the renal excretion increases.

## Competition

Because the same transporter (the heterodimeric SLC7A9/ SLC3A1 in Table 36-1) that carries Arg across the apical membrane also transports lysine (Lys) and ornithine, competition from Arg decreases the reabsorption of the other two (see Table 36-2, section B). As a result, the urinary excretion of Lys and ornithine also increases. Because the metabolic production of Lys and ornithine does not change, plasma concentrations of these two amino acids, in contrast to that of Arg, usually fall.

## Renal Aminoacidurias

The renal aminoacidurias result from an autosomal recessive defect in an amino-acid transporter (see Table 36-2, section C) and thus also affects absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (see

Box 45-3). In Hartnup disease, the defective apical transporter (SLC6A19) normally handles neutral amino acids (e.g., alanine, serine), including those with rings (i.e., phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine). In cystinuria, the affected apical transporter is the heterodimeric SLC7A9/SLC3A1 that carries cystine (Cys-S-S-Cys) and cationic amino acids (i.e., Arg, Lys, ornithine). An increased filtered load of one of these amino acids leads to increased excretion of all of them. Nephrolithiasis (i.e., kidney stones) may be a consequence of the increased excretion of the poorly soluble cystine.

Probably the most severe renal hyperaminoaciduria is lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI), resulting from the reduced reabsorption of Lys and Arg. The resulting low blood [Arg] impairs the urea cycle and detoxification of ammonium (hyperammonemia). Other features include alveolar proteinosis (the leading cause of death), hepatosplenomegaly, and-in severe cases-mental deterioration. The defective proximal-tubule basolateral transporter (the heterodimeric SLC7A7/SLC3A2) normally mediates the efflux of Arg and Lys into blood in exchange for the uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and neutral amino acids.

## Generalized Proximal-Tubule Dysfunction

Fanconi syndrome (see Table 36-2, section D), which can be inherited or acquired, is characterized by a generalized loss of proximal-tubule function. As a result, several solutes-in addition to amino acids-inappropriately appear in the urine: low-molecular-weight filtered proteins, glucose, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and phosphate.

Several peptidases are present at the outer surface of the brush-border membrane of proximal-tubule cells (see Fig. 36-6B), just as they are in the small intestine (see p. 922). These brush-border enzymes (e.g., $\gamma$-glutamyltransferase, aminopeptidases, endopeptidases, and dipeptidases) hydrolyze many peptides, including angiotensin II (see p. 841), thereby releasing into the tubule lumen the free constituent amino acids and oligopeptides. Tubule cells reabsorb the
resulting free amino acids as described in the previous section. The cell also absorbs the resulting oligopeptides (two to five residues)-as well as other peptides (e.g., carnosine) that are resistant to brush-border enzymes-using the apical H/oligopeptide cotransporters PepT1 (SLC15A1) and PepT2 (SLC15A2; see p. 123). PepT1 is a low-affinity, highcapacity system in the early proximal tubule, whereas PepT2 is a high-affinity, low-capacity transporter in the late

proximal segments-analogous in their properties to SGLT2 and SGLT1 (see pp. 121-122).

Once inside the cell, the oligopeptides undergo hydrolysis by cytosolic peptidases; this pathway is involved in the degradation of neurotensin and bradykinin. The distinction between which oligopeptides the cells fully digest in the lumen and which they take up via a PepT is not clear-cut. Oligopeptides that are more resistant to hydrolysis by peptidases are probably more likely to enter via a PepT.

Proteins Although the glomerular filtration barrier (see p. 726) generally prevents the filtration of large amounts of protein, this restriction is incomplete (see pp. 741-743). For example, the albumin concentration in the filtrate is very low ( 4 to $20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{L}$ ), only $0.01 \%$ to $0.05 \%$ of the plasma albumin concentration. Nevertheless, given a GFR of $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, the filtered albumin amounts to 0.7 to $3.6 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. In contrast, albumin excretion in the urine normally is only $\sim 30 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Thus, the tubules reabsorb some $96 \%$ to $99 \%$ of filtered albumin (Fig. 36-7A). In addition to albumin, the tubules extensively reabsorb low-molecular-weight proteins that are relatively freely filtered (e.g., lysozyme, light chains of immunoglobulins, and $\beta_{2}$-microglobulin), SH-containing peptides (e.g., insulin), and other polypeptide hormones (e.g., parathyroid hormone [PTH], atrial natriuretic peptide [ANP], and glucagon). It is therefore not surprising that tubule injury can give rise to proteinuria even in the absence of glomerular injury.

Proximal-tubule cells use receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42) to reabsorb proteins and polypeptides (see Fig. 36-7B). The first step is binding to receptors at the apical membrane (the receptor complex composed of megalin, cubilin, and amnionless), followed by internalization into clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles. Factors that interfere with vesicle formation or internalization, such as metabolic inhibitors and cytochalasin B, inhibit this selective absorption. The vesicles fuse with endosomes; this fusion recycles the vesicle membrane to the apical surface and targets the vesicle content for delivery to lysosomes. At the lysosomes, acid-dependent proteases largely digest the contents over a period that is on the order of minutes for peptide hormones and many hours or even days for other proteins. The cells ultimately release the low-molecular-weight end products of digestion, largely amino acids, across the basolateral membrane into the peritubular circulation. Although the proximal tubule hardly reabsorbs any protein in an intact state, a small subset of proteins avoids the lysosomes and moves by transcytosis for release at the basolateral membrane.

In addition to the apical absorption and degradation pathway, the kidney has two other pathways for protein degradation. The first may be important for several bioactive proteins, particularly those for which receptors are present on the basolateral membrane (e.g., insulin, ANP, AVP, and PTH). After transcytosis, the proximal-tubule cell partially hydrolyzes peptide hormones at the basolateral cell membrane. The resulting peptide fragments re-enter the

![bo7921257579](bo7921257579.jpg)
circulation, where they are available for glomerular filtration and ultimate handling by the apical absorption/degradation pathway. The second alternative pathway for protein degradation involves receptor-mediated endocytosis by endothelial cells of the renal vascular and glomerular structures. This pathway participates in the catabolism of small peptides, such as ANP.

In conclusion, the kidney plays a major role in the metabolism of small proteins and peptide hormones. Renal extraction rates may be large, and they account for as much as $80 \%$ of the total metabolic clearance. Thus, it is not surprising that end-stage renal disease can lead to elevated levels of glucagon, PTH, gastrin, and ANP. Under physiological conditions, glomerular filtration represents the rate-limiting step for the removal of low-molecular-weight proteins from the circulation-apical absorption by the tubules, intracellular hydrolysis, and peritubular hydrolysis do not saturate over a wide range of filtered loads.

## Two separate apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven cotransporters reabsorb monocarboxylates and dicarboxylates/ tricarboxylates

The combined concentration of carboxylates in the blood plasma is 1 to 3 mM , of which lactate represents the largest fraction. The monocarboxylates pyruvate and lactate are products of anaerobic glucose metabolism (see pp. 11741176). The dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates include intermediates of the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185). Because these carboxylates are important for energy metabolism, their loss in the urine would be wasteful. Normally, the proximal tubule reabsorbs virtually all these substances (Fig. 36-8A). Nevertheless, carboxylates may appear in the urine when their plasma levels are elevated. Urinary excretion may occur when the filtered load of acetoacetate and $\beta$ hydroxybutyrate-ketone bodies (see p. 1185) produced during starvation or during low-insulin states (diabetes mel-litus)-exceeds the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ in the proximal tubule.

Two groups of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent cotransporters carry carboxylates across the apical membranes (see Fig. 36-8B). First, SLC5A8 and SLC5A12 transport monocarboxylates, including lactate, pyruvate, acetoacetate, and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate. Second, NaDC1 (SLC13A2) carries dicarboxylates and tricarboxylates, such as $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$, malate, succinate, and citrate.

Once inside the cell, the monocarboxylates exit across the basolateral membrane via the $\mathrm{H}^{+} /$monocarboxylate cotransporter MCT2 (SLC16A7). Because monocarboxylates enter across the apical membrane coupled to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and then exit across the basolateral membrane coupled to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, monocarboxylate reabsorption leads to an accumulation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by the cell and a rise in intracellular pH .

Dicarboxylates exit the cell across the basolateral membrane via multiple organic anion-carboxylate exchangers; for example, the renal organic anion transporters OAT1 (SLC22A6) and OAT3 (SLC22A8; see p. 125). These exchangers may overlap in substrate specificity, or even carry anions of different valence. Moreover, the molecular identities and stoichiometries of some of these transporters are unknown.

## The proximal tubule secretes PAH and a variety of other organic anions

The kidneys handle PAH, as well as many other organic anions (e.g., many metabolites of endogenous compounds and administered drugs), by both filtration and secretion (Fig. 36-9A). The synthetic monovalent anion PAH (see p. 749) is somewhat unusual in that $\sim 20 \%$ of it binds to plasma proteins, largely albumin. Thus, only $\sim 80 \%$ of PAH

is available for filtration. Assuming a filtration fraction (see p. 746) of $20 \%$, only $80 \% \times 20 \%$, or $16 \%$, of the arterial load of PAH appears in Bowman's space. Nevertheless, at low plasma [PAH], the kidneys excrete into the urine nearly all ( $\sim 90 \%$ ) of the PAH entering the renal arteries, so that very little PAH remains in the renal veins. Because the kidneys almost completely clear it from the blood in a single passage, PAH is useful for measuring renal plasma flow (see pp. 749-750).

The nephron secretes PAH mainly in the late proximal tubule (S3 segment) via the transcellular route, against a sizeable electrochemical gradient. PAH uptake across the basolateral membrane occurs via the high-affinity OAT1 (SLC22A6) and the lower-affinity OAT3 (SLC22A8) transporters, driven by the outward gradient of $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$, (5) N36-6 which is a dicarboxylate (see Fig. 36-9B). This uptake of PAH is an example of tertiary active transport because the basolateral Na/dicarboxylate cotransporter NaDC3 (SLC13A3)in a process of secondary active transport-elevates $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ levels in the cell, creating the outward $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ gradient. NaDC3 carries three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and one dicarboxylate into the cell. Finally, the basolateral Na-K pump-in a process of primary active transport-establishes the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient used to drive the accumulation of $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$.

The apical step of PAH secretion probably occurs via exchange for luminal anions, electrogenic facilitated diffusion driven by the inside-negative membrane potential (e.g., via OATv1), or an ABC transporter (e.g., MRP4). Several anionic drugs (e.g., probenecid) that compete at the basolateral PAH-anion exchanger or the apical PAH-anion exchanger inhibit PAH secretion from blood to lumen.

The late proximal tubule secretes a wide variety of other organic anions in addition to PAH. These anions include the following (Table 36-3): (1) endogenous anions, such as oxalate and bile salts; (2) exogenous anions such as the drugs penicillin and furosemide; and (3) uncharged molecules conjugated to anionic groups such as sulfate or glucuronate (see pp. 955-956). The proximal tubule secretes these anions into the lumen using basolateral and apical anion exchangers that are similar to those involved in PAH secretion (see Fig. 36-9B). At the apical membrane, the secreted anion appears to exchange for luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, urate, or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$.

## PAH secretion is an example of a $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$-limited mechanism

Just as glucose reabsorption saturates at its $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ as one increases plasma [glucose], PAH secretion (Fig. 36-10A, red curve) saturates at a sufficiently high plasma [PAH]. Starting from an initially low value, increasing plasma [PAH] causes excretion (green curve) to rise much faster than filtration (orange curve). Subtracting the amount filtered from the amount excreted, we see that the rate of PAH secretion at first rises rapidly with plasma [PAH]. However, as plasma [PAH] approaches $\sim 20 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, the amount of secreted PAH reaches a plateau $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$, typically 60 to $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{min}$, indicating saturation of secretory mechanisms.

After plasma [PAH] has increased enough to reach the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$, further increases in plasma [PAH] increase urinary excretion, but only as a consequence of the increase in the filtered load-not because of increased tubule secretion. At

these high plasma PAH levels, the kidneys can no longer fully remove PAH from the blood in a single pass through the kidney, and therefore it is no longer appropriate to use PAH secretion to estimate renal plasma flow. At low plasma [PAH] values ( $<12 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ), PAH extraction from plasma flowing through the kidney is nearly complete ( $\sim 90 \%$ ), which forms the basis for using PAH clearance as a measure of renal plasma flow.

Recall that as plasma [glucose] increases, glucose clearance rises to approach inulin clearance (see Fig. 36-4B). In contrast, PAH clearance (see Fig. 36-10B, red curve) decreases with increasing plasma [PAH] and falls to approach inulin clearance (orange curve). The reason is that, as plasma [PAH] increases, secreted PAH forms a progressively smaller fraction of the PAH appearing in the urine.

## The proximal tubule both reabsorbs and secretes urate

Urate, a monovalent anion, is the end product of purine catabolism (Fig. 36-11A). Plasma [urate] is typically 3 to $7 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(0.2$ to 0.4 mM$)$ and is elevated in gout. The glomeruli filter urate, and then the proximal tubule both reabsorbs and secretes urate (see Fig. 36-11B). Reabsorption is the more important transport pathway in the human kidney, which excretes only $\sim 10 \%$ of filtered urate under normal conditions.

# N36-6 Role of OAT1 and OAT3 in the Renal Transport of Organic Anions 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

OAT1 and OAT3 transporters are members of the SLC22 family of organic ion transporters (see Table 5-4). The OAT1 and OAT3 proteins shown in Figure 36-8B are in fact the same transporters as shown in Figure 36-9B. The "Organic anion" entering the cell across the basolateral membrane in Figure $36-8 B$ could be any of several monovalent organic anions (including the nonphysiological $\mathrm{PAH}^{-}$), and the "Dicarboxylate" exiting the cell across the basolateral membrane in Figure $36-9 B$ could be any of several dicarboxylates, including $\alpha-K G$.

Reabsorption The proximal tubule reabsorbs urate by both a paracellular route involving passive diffusion and a transcellular route involving active transport (see Fig. 36-11C, top portion). The contribution of the paracellular pathway can become apparent during extracellular volume depletion, which can lead to a compensatory enhancement of proximal-tubule fluid reabsorption. The resulting increase in luminal [urate] can then enhance paracellular urate reabsorption, thereby decreasing net urate excretion and raising plasma [urate].

The transcellular route involves an active apical uptake step, mediated by three different transporters. URAT1 (SLC22A12; see p. 125) exchanges luminal urate for intracellular monocarboxylates, whereas OAT4 (SLC22A11) and OAT10 (SLC22A13; see p. 125) both exchange luminal urate for intracellular dicarboxylates. N36-7 Once inside the cell, urate exits across the basolateral membrane by facilitated diffusion via the voltage-driven transporter URATv1 (SLC2A9).

Uricosuric agents such as probenecid, salicylate, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit URAT1 and thereby increase urate excretion. Indeed, probenecid is useful in the treatment of gout.

Secretion Proximal-tubule cells are also capable of secreting urate. The basolateral step of urate secretion (see Fig. 36-11C, bottom portion) occurs by organic anion exchange via OAT1 and OAT3 (which also mediate basolateral PAH uptake; see Fig. 36-9B) in exchange for intracellular dicarboxylates such as $\alpha$-KG. Once inside the cell, urate exits across the apical membrane via two SLCs, NPT1 (SLC17A1)
and the voltage-driven NPT4 (SLC17A3), and via two ABC transporters (see Table 5-6), MRP4 (ABCC4) and BCRP (ABCG2; see Fig. 46-5D). Under certain conditions, renal urate excretion can exceed the quantity filtered, which indicates net secretion.

## The late proximal tubule secretes several organic cations

The late proximal tubule (Fig. 36-12A) is also responsible for secreting a wide range of both endogenous and exogenous organic cations (see Table 36-3). Some of the most important secreted endogenous organic cations are the monoamine neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, epinephrine, norepinephrine, and histamine; see p. 315) and creatinine, the breakdown product of phosphocreatine. Despite this modest secretion, creatinine is a useful index of GFR (see p. 741). Exogenous secreted organic cations include morphine, quinine, and the diuretic amiloride (see pp. 758-759).

At the basolateral membrane, the polyspecific organic cation transporter OCT2 (SLC22A2; see p. 115) mediates the uptake of these organic cations (see Fig. 36-12B) via facilitated diffusion. The driving force for this electrogenic process is the inside-negative membrane potential of the cell.

At the apical membrane, the organic cation-H exchangers MATE1 (SLC47A1) and MATE2-K (SLC47A2) as well as the ABC transporter MDR1 (ABCB1; see Table 5-6) move these cations from the cell to the lumen (see Fig. 36-12B). The energy for the extrusion of the organic cations via the MATEs is the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$electrochemical gradient across the apical membrane from lumen to cell. Because the apical Na-H exchanger

# N36-7 Tertiary Active Transport of Urate 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The apical uptake of urate in exchange for monocarboxylates (URAT1) or dicarboxylates (OAT4 or OAT10) in Figure 36-11C is an example of tertiary active transport.

In the case of monocarboxylates, an undefined $\mathrm{Na} /$ monocarboxylate cotransporter at the apical membrane mediates the uptake of monocarboxylates-an example of secondary active transport, energized by the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient.

In the case of dicarboxylates, NaDC1 at the apical membrane mediates the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven uptake of dicarboxylatesanother an example of secondary active transport, energized by the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient.

In both cases, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump at the basolateral membrane (a primary active transporter) extrudes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the cell and thereby establishes the out-to-in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient.

(a secondary active transporter) is largely responsible for establishing this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient, the cation- H exchange is an example of tertiary active transport.

## Nonionic diffusion of neutral weak acids and bases across tubules explains why their excretion is pH dependent

Many cations or anions are, in fact, weak acids or bases in equilibrium with a neutral species (see pp. 628-629), which generally diffuses across a membrane much faster than the corresponding cation or anion. This rapid diffusion usually occurs because the neutral species is far more soluble in the lipid bilayer of cell membranes than is the charged species. (5) N36-8

Changing the luminal pH can substantially affect the overall transport of a buffer pair. For example, acidifying the tubule lumen promotes the reabsorption of a neutral weak acid and the secretion of a neutral weak base. In the case of a neutral weak acid such as salicylic acid (Fig. 36-13A), the glomerular filtrate contains both the neutral weak acid (HA) and its conjugate weak base, which is an anion ( $\mathrm{A}^{-}$).

# N36-8 Mechanism of Nonionic Diffusion 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Nonionic diffusion refers to the passive flux across a membrane of the uncharged (i.e., neutral or "not ionic") form of a buffer pair. Thus, for the HA/A' buffer pair $\left(\mathrm{HA}=\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{\prime}\right)$, HA is the nonionic component. For the $\mathrm{BH}^{+}$or $\mathrm{BH} / \mathrm{B}$ buffer pair $\left(\mathrm{BH}^{+}=\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$, B is the nonionic component. For buffer pairs in which both members are charged (e.g., $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}=\mathrm{H}^{+}$ $+\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ ) then by definition neither of the members of the buffer pair can participate in nonionic diffusion.

In nonionic diffusion, the energy driving the net flux of HA or B across the membrane is the chemical or concentration gradient according to Fick's law (see p. 108):

$$
J_{\mathrm{HA}}=P_{\mathrm{HA}}\left(\left[\mathrm{HA}_{0}-[\mathrm{HA}]_{0}\right.\right.
$$

$(\mathrm{NE} 36-3)$
Here, the flux $J_{\mathrm{HA}}$ is positive when $\left[\mathrm{HA}_{0}>\left[\mathrm{HA}\right]\right.$ (i.e., the extracellular concentration exceeds the intracellular concentration) and HA diffuses passively into the cell. $P_{\mathrm{HA}}$ is the permeability of the cell membrane to HA. In the case of a neutral weak base, the flux would be

$$
J_{\mathrm{B}}=P_{\mathrm{B}}\left(\left[\mathrm{~B}\right]_{0}-[\mathrm{B}]_{0}\right)
$$

(NE 36-4)
Notice that we have not said anything about the mechanism by which HA or B moves across the cell membrane. Traditionally, people had thought that neutral species (e.g., acetic or lactic acids, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ) would simply dissolve in the lipid phase of a biological membrane according to the oil/water partition coefficient of the species in question. This simple mechanism may account for a part of the membrane permeability to these neutral substances, but certainly not all, and in some carefully studied cases, very little. Many small neutral species cross biological membranes via transporters or channels. Examples of transporters that can carry lactic acid across the plasma membrane are the MCT monocarboxylic acid transporters (SLC16 family; see Table 5-4). Other membrane proteins can serve as channels for dissolved gases. The first example of such a channel was aquaporin 1 (AOP1), which serves as a conduit for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and also $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. The rhesus (Rh) protein family also are channels for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. Although the movement of the solute in question may occur via a transporter or a channel, the thermodynamic driving force is still the chemical gradient (i.e., the movement is still passive) and fits the description of nonionic diffusion.

A striking example of how luminal pH affects the clearance of a weak acid is the renal handling of salicylic acid and its anion species, salicylate. At a urinary pH of $\sim 7.5$, the amount of total salicylate (salicylic acid + salicylate anion) excreted is the same as the filtered load (see Fig. 36-13C); that is, the clearance of total salicylate ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {Salicylate }}$ ) equals GFR. Lower urinary pH values favor the titration of luminal salicylate anion to salicylic acid, which the tubule readily reabsorbs. Hence, lowering pH causes the fractional excretion of total salicylate $\left(\mathrm{FE}_{\text {Salicylate }}=\mathrm{C}_{\text {Salicylate }} / \mathrm{GFR}\right.$; see p. 733) to fall to less than unity. At very low urinary pH values, the kidney reabsorbs virtually all salicylate, and $\mathrm{FE}_{\text {Salicylate }}$ approaches zero. However, at urinary pH values higher than $\sim 7.5$, $\mathrm{FE}_{\text {Salicylate }}$ increases markedly because the alkalinity keeps luminal levels of the salicylate anion high and levels of salicylic acid low, so that the neutral weak acid now diffuses from blood to lumen.

It is possible to treat overdoses of salicylate or acetylsalicylate (i.e., aspirin) by alkalinizing the urine with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or by increasing urine flow with diuretics. (5) N36-9 The reason is that both high pH and high urine flow keep luminal levels of salicylic acid low, which maintains a sink for salicylic acid in the lumen. Both treatments enhance the urinary excretion of the drug and lower plasma concentrations.

The converse example of urinary pH dependence is seen in the excretion of a neutral weak base, such as chloroquine (see Fig. 36-13D). (5) N36-10

## PHOSPHATE

The metabolism of inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ depends on bone, the gastrointestinal tract, and the kidneys (see p. 1054). About half of total plasma phosphate (Table 36-4) is in an ionized form, and the rest is either complexed to small solutes ( $\sim 40 \%$ ) or bound to protein ( $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ ). The plasma concentration of total $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ varies rather widely, between 0.8 and $1.5 \mathrm{mM}(2.5$ to $4.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ of elemental phosphorus). Thus, the filterable phosphate (i.e., both the ionized and complexed) varies between $\sim 0.7$ and 1.3 mM . At a normal blood pH of $7.4,80 \%$ of the ionized plasma phosphate is $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{+}$and the rest is $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$. Assuming that the total plasma phosphate concentration is $4.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, that only the free and complexed phosphate is filterable, and that the GFR is $180 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, each day the kidneys filter $\sim 7000 \mathrm{mg}$ of phosphate. Because this amount is more than an order of magnitude greater than the total extracellular pool of phosphate (see pp. 1054-1056), it is clear that the kidney must reabsorb most of the phosphate filtered in the glomerulus.

## The proximal tubule reabsorbs phosphate via apical Na/phosphate cotransporters

The proximal tubule reabsorbs $80 \%$ to $95 \%$ of the filtered phosphate (Fig. 36-14A). More distal nephron segments reabsorb a negligible fraction of the filtered phosphate. Thus, the kidneys excrete $5 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the filtered load of phosphate in the urine under normal conditions.

The proximal tubule reabsorbs most of the filtered phosphate by the transcellular route (see Fig. 36-14B). Phosphate

## N36-9 Treatment of Salicylate Poisoning

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As noted in the text on page 785, physicians can treat salicylate poisoning by using the principle of nonionic diffusion of a neutral weak acid, outlined in Figure 36-13A. Alkalinizing the tubule lumen increases the trapping of the salicylate anion in the urine. The most common cause of salicylate poisoning is the accidental or suicidal overdose of aspirin. Signs of the poisoning include a severe metabolic acidosis and a compensatory respiratory alkalosis. The twofold purpose of the treatment is to neutralize the metabolic acidosis and to eliminate the salicylate. The treatment is to administer $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ intravenously to alkalinize the urine above a pH of 7.5 , while making sure that the plasma pH does not exceed 7.55 .

## N36-10 Treatment of a PCP Overdose

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Phencyclidine hydrochloride-whose formal name is phenylcyclohexyl piperidine HCl (PCP) and whose street names include "angel dust"-can be thought of as the salt $\mathrm{BH}^{\circ} \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. When dissolved in water, the $\mathrm{BH}^{\circ}$ will equilibrate with the neutral form of the drug (B) as follows: $\mathrm{BH}^{\circ}=\mathrm{B}+\mathrm{H}^{\circ}$.

It is possible to treat PCP intoxication by using the principle shown in Figure 36-13B; namely, by decreasing the urinary pH and thereby increasing the trapping of the phencyclidine cation $\left(\mathrm{BH}^{\circ}\right)$ in the urine. Although PCP was originally developed as an intravenous anesthetic in the 1950s, its use was discontinued in 1965 because of its side effects, which include hallucinations and confusion. Today, the most common cause of PCP intoxication is recreational drug use. The therapy has two goals: to promote the rapid urinary excretion of the drug, and to treat the neurological symptoms with antidotes that target the neurotransmitter systems most activated in a particular patient. Regarding the urinary excretion, acidification of the urine can increase the rate of excretion 100-fold. Acidification of the urine can be promoted by administering vitamin C (ascorbic acid) or ammonium chloride. By the effect shown in Figure 36-13D, this maneuver increases the excretion of the drug. In the absence of urinary acidification, the slow clearance of PCP means that screening for substance abuse can produce a positive urine test result as long as 7 days after casual use and 30 days after habitual use.

The same approach can be used to increase the clearance of other weak bases, such as the psychotropic drug remoxipride.

ions enter the cell across the apical membrane by secondary active transport, energized by the apical electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient. At least three separate Na/phosphate cotransporters contribute: NaPi-IIa (SLC34A1; see Table 5-4), NaPi-IIc (SLC34A3) and PiT-2 (SLC20A2).
$\mathrm{NaPi}-\mathrm{IIa}$ translocates three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and one divalent phosphate ion $\left(\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$. Thus, the process is electrogenic (net positive charge into the cell). ( $\mathrm{N36-11}$ In contrast, $\mathrm{NaPi}-\mathrm{IIc}$ is electroneutral, with a stoichiometry of two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions per one $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$. Because $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ rather than $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$is the preferred substrate of $\mathrm{NaPi}-\mathrm{IIc}$, low luminal pH inhibits phosphate reabsorption by shifting the phosphate equilibrium toward $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$. Of the three transporters, $\mathrm{NaPi}-\mathrm{IIc}$ is most important in humans, based on the phosphate wasting and hypophosphatemia that occurs in patients with NaPi-IIc mutations. Finally, PiT-2 is electrogenic, with a stoichiometry of $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions per monovalent phosphate $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}\right)$.
The passive exit of phosphate across the basolateral membrane occurs by mechanisms that are still unknown (see Fig. 36-14B).

## Phosphate excretion in the urine already occurs at physiological plasma concentrations

Phosphate handling by the kidney shares some of the properties of renal glucose handling, including threshold, saturation with $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ kinetics, and splay (Fig. 36-15). However, important differences exist. First, some phosphate excretion (green curve) occurs even at normal levels of plasma [phosphate]. Thus, a small increment in the plasma [phosphate] results in significant acceleration of phosphate excretion (i.e., to higher values along the green curve), whereas plasma [glucose] must double before glucose excretion even commences. Second, the kidney reaches the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ for phosphate (red curve) at the high end of normal plasma [phosphate] values, whereas the kidney reaches the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ for glucose at

levels that are far higher than physiological plasma [glucose] levels. Third, the renal phosphate $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ is sensitive to a variety of stimuli, including hormones and acid-base balance, whereas the glucose $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$ is insensitive to regulators of glucose metabolism, such as insulin. Accordingly, the kidney plays an important role in the regulation of plasma [phosphate] but does not normally modulate plasma [glucose].

## PTH inhibits apical Na/phosphate uptake, promoting phosphate excretion

Table 36-5 summarizes the major hormones and other factors that regulate phosphate transport by the proximal tubule.

The most important hormonal regulator is PTH, which inhibits phosphate reabsorption (see p. 1062) and thus promotes phosphate excretion. PTH is a classic example of a rapid regulator that does not require protein synthesis. PTH binds to PTH 1 receptors (PTH1Rs), which appear to couple to two heterotrimeric G proteins (see p. 1061). The first $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\right)$ activates adenylyl cyclase and, via cAMP, stimulates protein kinase A (PKA; see p. 57). The second $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$, particularly at low PTH levels, activates phospholipase C (PLC), and then protein kinase C (PKC; see pp. 60-61). Once activated, PKA and PKC promote endocytotic removal of NaPi from the apical membrane with targeting for degradation in lysosomes, which reduces phosphate reabsorption.

Another inhibitor of phosphate reabsorption is dopamine, which acts via D1 receptors and, like PTH, activates the cAMP/PKA pathway. High dietary phosphate intake decreases phosphate reabsorption, even without changes in PTH levels. Changes in plasma [phosphate], such as those that occur in phosphate depletion or loading, also modulate

# N36-11 The Type II Na/Phosphate Cotransporter NaPi-Ila 

## Contributed by Jürg Biber

As noted in the text, the apical Na/phosphate cotransporter NaPi -Ila (SLC34A1; see Table 5-4) translocates three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and one divalent phosphate ion $\left(\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$, and thus the process is electrogenic. As pH along the lumen of the proximal tubule falls, the relative concentration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{2-}$ falls as well, so that one might expect that the uptake of inorganic phosphate by NaPi -lla would become less effective. On the other hand, the affinity of NaPi -lla for $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ is so high ( $K_{i} \cong 50 \mu \mathrm{M}$ ) that the effect should not be severe.

the surface expression of NaPi cotransporters. Both phosphate depletion and 1,25-dihydroxy-vitamin D (see pp. 10631065) upregulate the cotransporter. Glucocorticoid excess and metabolic acidosis downregulate the cotransporter; the latter effect is synergistic with the direct effects of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$on the NaPi protein (see above). Because phosphate is the primary pH buffer in normal urine, factors that increase urinary [phosphate] (e.g., acidosis) increase the titratable acidity component of renal acid excretion (see p. 823).

## Fibroblast growth factor 23 and other phosphatonins also inhibit apical Na/phosphate uptake, promoting phosphate excretion

Phosphatonins are the circulating factors that cause renal phosphate wasting in diseases such as oncogenic osteomalacia, autosomal dominant hypophosphatemic rickets, and X-linked hypophosphatemic rickets. In these diseases, phosphatonins-including fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), secreted frizzled-related protein 4 (sFRP4), and matrix extracellular phosphoprotein (MEPE)-cause the kidneys to excrete more phosphate.
FGF23 has emerged as a particularly important phosphateregulating hormone. In response to hyperphosphatemia, osteocytes release FGF23, which acts via the receptor tyrosine kinase FGFR1 (see p. 787) and the coreceptor Klotho (5) N36-12 to reduce the expression of Na/phosphate cotransporters and thereby augment renal phosphate excretion. In addition, FGF23 decreases the renal production of 1,25dihydroxyvitamin D and thus results in reduced phosphate absorption by the small intestine (see p. 1065).

## CALCIUM

Binding to plasma proteins and formation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-anion complexes influence the filtration and reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$

We discuss whole-body calcium balance-as well as the hormonal control of free, ionized plasma calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ levels-on page 1054. Here we consider the role of the kidney in calcium balance. The total calcium concentration in plasma is normally 2.2 to $2.6 \mathrm{mM}(8.8$ to $10.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$. Table 36-6 summarizes the forms of calcium in the plasma. Some $40 \%$ binds to plasma proteins, mainly albumin, and constitutes the nonfilterable fraction. The filterable portion, $\sim 60 \%$ of total plasma calcium, consists of two moieties. The first, $\sim 15 \%$ of the total, complexes with small anions such as carbonate, citrate, phosphate, and sulfate. The second, $\sim 45 \%$ of total calcium, is the ionized calcium $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right)$ that one may

measure with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive electrodes or dyes. It is the concentration of this free, ionized calcium that the body tightly regulates; plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ normally is 1.0 to 1.3 mM ( 4.0 to $5.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$.

The distribution of the various forms of total calcium is not fixed. Because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$competes with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for binding to anionic sites on proteins or small molecules, acidosis generally increases plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ and alkalosis acutely reduces it. Thus, acute alkalosis can cause signs and symptoms mimicking hypocalcemia. In addition, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding to proteins in the plasma depends on the concentrations of the proteins, particularly albumin. Thus, at a given $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, the total measured calcium will vary with serum albumin concentration. For example, in patients with low plasma albumin, total measured plasma calcium may be low despite a normal $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. (5) N36-13

The proximal tubule reabsorbs two thirds of filtered $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, with more distal segments reabsorbing nearly all of the remainder

The kidney reabsorbs $\sim 99 \%$ of the filtered load of calcium, principally at the proximal tubule, the thick ascending limb (TAL), and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) (Fig. 36-16A).

Proximal Tubule The proximal tubule reabsorbs $\sim 65 \%$ of the filtered calcium, a process that is not subject to hormonal control. Virtually all proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption occurs via the paracellular route (see Fig. 36-16B). The evidence for a large component of paracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transport is the high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability of the tubule, as well as the sensitivity of net $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transport to changes in the transepithelial electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. For example, imposing a lumen-negative transepithelial voltage induces $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ secretion, whereas a lumen-positive voltage induces reabsorption. The passive paracellular reabsorption of calcium is very dependent on luminal $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Water reabsorption tends to increase luminal $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, generating a favorable transepithelial gradient that drives passive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption by diffusion via the paracellular pathway. In addition, some calcium reabsorption may occur via solvent drag across the tight junctions. The greater the fluid reabsorption along the proximal tubule, the greater the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via both diffusion and solvent drag. For this reason, a high- NaCl diet-which increases extracellular volume and thus lowers proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water reabsorption-reduces $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption and increases urinary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion. One consequence is an elevated risk of calcium kidney stones.

Thick Ascending Limb The TAL reabsorbs $\sim 25 \%$ of the filtered calcium (see Fig. 36-16C). Most of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the TAL occurs passively via a paracellular route, driven by the lumen-positive voltage. Thus, it is not surprising that loop diuretics (see p. 757), which block the generation of the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage, acutely inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption.

Distal Convoluted Tubule The DCT reabsorbs $\sim 8 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ load (see Fig. 36-16D). Despite the relatively small amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ delivered, the DCT is a major regulatory site for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion. In contrast to the proximal tubule

The KL gene encodes two transcripts: a membrane protein with a single transmembrane segment (and related to $\beta$ glucosidase) and a secretory form. The transmembrane variant of Klotho associates with FGFR1 and acts as a coreceptor for FGF23. The secreted variant of Klotho, which is important in the resistance to aging (see p. 1247), is the result of ectodomain shedding.

## N36-13 Corrections for Plasma Calcium

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

Clinical laboratories routinely report total plasma calcium levels ( 8.8 to $10.6 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or 2.2 . to 2.6 mM ), not the ionized $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {plasma }}$ that the body tightly regulates. Because the fraction of total plasma calcium that is ionized varies greatly with the [albumin] plasma, the measured total plasma calcium is corrected for the patient's [albumin] plasma to obtain a corrected $[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}$ or adjusted $[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}$.

$$
\underbrace{\text { Corrected }[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}}_{\text {mg/dL }}=\underbrace{\text { Measured }[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}}_{\text {mg/dL }}+0.8 \cdot[4.0-[\text { albumin }]_{\text {plasma }}]_{\text {g/dL }}
$$

The equation assumes a normal [albumin] plasma of $4 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$.
Thus, the corrected $[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}$ in a patient with hypoalbuminemia (e.g., [albumin] plasma of $3 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is $0.8 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ higher than the measured $[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}$. The physician then applies the theoretical fractional distribution of the different calcium $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entities to the corrected $[\mathrm{Ca}]_{\text {plasma }}$.

A change in the level of the anions with which $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ can form complexes also affects the distribution of different calcium $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entities. Tubule cells probably reabsorb $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ anion complexes poorly. However, because the concentration of these anions declines along the nephron owing to anion reabsorption, free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ becomes available for transport.

and TAL, the DCT reabsorbs $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ predominantly via an active, transcellular route (see next section).

The quantitative contribution of the collecting ducts and tubules to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption is quite small ( $\sim 1 \%$ of the filtered load), and their role in regulating renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion is not well defined.

## Transcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ movement is a two-step process, involving passive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry through apical channels and basolateral extrusion by electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Ca}$ exchange and a Ca pump

Because $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is only $\sim 100 \mathrm{nM}(\sim 10,000$-fold less than in extracellular fluid), and because the membrane voltage across the apical membrane is approximately -70 mV , a steep electrochemical gradient favors $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry across the apical membrane. Work on the DCT shows that apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$
entry is passive, mediated by the epithelial $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels TRPV5 and TRPV6 (ECaC1 and ECaC2).

As $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the tubule cell across the apical membrane, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins (i.e., calbindins) buffer the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, helping to keep $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ low and maintaining a favorable gradient for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx. In addition, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may temporarily enter certain organelles, particularly the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. In the steady state, however, the cell must extrude across the basolateral membrane all the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that enters across the apical membrane. Both primary and secondary active transporters participate in this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion against a steep electrochemical gradient. The primary active transporter is an ATP-driven plasma-membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ATPase or pump (PMCA1b; see p. 118).

In addition to the Ca pump, an Na-Ca exchanger (NCX1; see pp. 123-124) also extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the basolateral membrane of tubule cells. At physiologically low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$

levels, when NCX1 is not very active, the major pathway for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion is the Ca pump. Only when $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increases does the NCX1 begin to make a significant contribution. Conversely, if the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is normal and the inward $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$electrochemical gradient falls (e.g., $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ rises), the NCX1 can reverse direction and load the cell with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

## PTH and vitamin D stimulate-whereas high plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ inhibits- $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption

Table 36-7 summarizes factors that modulate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ handling by various segments of the nephron.

Parathyroid Hormone The most important regulator of renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption is $\mathbf{P T H}$, which stimulates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the DCT and the connecting tubule. Regarding TRPV5, PTH increases transcription and open probability, and inhibits endocytosis, thereby stimulating $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. In addition to its effects to stimulate apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, PTH also upregulates expression of calbindin and NCX1.

As we saw in our discussion of phosphate handling (see pp. 786-787), PTH acts by binding to the PTH1R receptor, which apparently couples to two heterotrimeric G proteins and activates two kinases (see p. 1061), PKA (see p. 57) and PKC (see pp. 60-61) Both pathways are essential for the action of PTH on apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry.

Vitamin D Acting on gene transcription, vitamin D (see pp. 1063-1067) increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the distal nephron; this renal reabsorption complements the major $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-retaining action of vitamin $\mathrm{D}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption in the gastrointestinal tract (see p. 938). In renal tubule cells, vitamin D upregulates TRPV5 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding proteins, which contribute to enhanced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption by keeping $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ low during increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ traffic through the cell.

Plasma $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Levels As discussed on page 768, extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binds to a basolateral $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensing receptor (CaSR) in the TAL, which leads to a reduction in the lumen-positive transepithelial potential. CaSR activation also leads to a reduction in paracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ permeability in this nephron segment. Because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the TAL is predominantly passive and paracellular (see p. 787), these CaSRmediated decreases in driving force and permeability lead to reduced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption and thus increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion, tending to compensate for hypercalcemia. (1) N36-14

An interesting consequence of reduced $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption induced by high plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ is an inhibition of the kidney's ability to generate a concentrated urine (see p. 811). Indeed, chronic hypercalcemia results in a dilute urine, a form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (see p. 819). By keeping urine $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ relatively low, this effect may help avoid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stones under conditions of high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion.

Diuretics Among diuretics, those acting on the TAL, such as furosemide, acutely decrease $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption, whereas those acting on the distal nephron, such as thiazides and amiloride, increase $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Thus, of these drugs, only the powerful loop diuretic furosemide is appropriate for treating hypercalcemic states. In the TAL, furosemide (see p. 757) reduces the lumen-positive voltage, and thus the driving force for passive, paracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Accordingly, with furosemide, urinary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion increases in parallel with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion.

In contrast to furosemide, thiazides and amiloride increase $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Thiazide diuretics (see p. 758) inhibit $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport and stimulate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the DCT. Inhibiting apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport lowers $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ in the DCT cell, thus hyperpolarizing the cell. The steeper electrical gradient increases apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, secondarily stimulating basolateral $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion. Amiloride (see pp. 758-759) inhibits apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the initial and cortical collecting tubules and hyperpolarizes the apical membrane. Thus, like the thiazides, amiloride augments $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption by enhancing the gradient for apical $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry.

Volume depletion induced by any of these diuretics will increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the proximal tubule and thus secondarily increase passive proximal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption (see p. 787). In the case of thiazides and amiloride, volume depletion further decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion. Physicians exploit the ability of thiazides to reduce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion, particularly in a state of mild volume contraction, to lower urinary $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in patients with calcium-containing kidney stones. In the case of furosemide, if the patient is allowed to become volume depleted, the proximal effect will blunt the primary calciuric effect.

## MAGNESIUM

## Most $\mathbf{M g}^{2+}$ reabsorption takes place along the TAL

Approximately $99 \%$ of the total body stores of magnesium reside either within bone ( $\sim 54 \%$ ) or within the intracellular compartment ( $\sim 45 \%$ ), mostly muscle. Renal magnesium excretion plays an important role in maintaining physiological plasma magnesium levels. The body maintains the total magnesium concentration in blood plasma within narrow limits, 0.8 to $1.0 \mathrm{mM}(1.8$ to $2.2 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL})$. Of this total, $\sim 30 \%$ is protein bound (Table 36-8). The remaining $\sim 70 \%$ of total magnesium, which is filterable, is made up of two components. Less than $10 \%$ is complexed to anions such as phosphate, citrate, and oxalate, thus leaving $\sim 60 \%$ of the total as free, ionized magnesium $\left(\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right)$.

Disturbances of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ metabolism usually involve abnormal losses, and these occur most frequently during gastrointestinal malabsorption (see p. 939) and diarrhea, in the course of renal disease, and following the administration of

## N36-14 Effect of Hypercalcemia on Ability to Create a Concentrated Urine

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

As noted on page 791, hypercalcemia (i.e., high plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ ), acting via the CaSR, reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the TAL. One result is of this action is reduced osmolality in the renal medulla, which in turn impairs the kidney's ability to generate concentrated urine (see p. 811). Indeed, chronic hypercalcemia results in a dilute urine, a form of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (see Box 38-1). By keeping urine $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ relatively low, this effect may help avoid $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stones under conditions of high $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion.

## N36-16 Regulation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Reabsorption

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

In addition to the factors discussed beginning on page 789, several other factors modulate the handling of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

## Effective Circulating Volume

A reduction in effective circulating volume triggers four parallel effector pathways (see p. 836) that act to restore volume. One of these pathways-the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system-increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the proximal tubule (see pp. 766-768). Because proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption depends largely on transepithelial voltage and solvent drag (see p. 787), which in turn depend on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption, it is not surprising that volume contraction, which increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, also increases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Volume expansion has the opposite effects on both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption.

## Acid-Base Balance

Metabolic alkalosis increases renal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption (i.e., decreases excretion) at the level of the DCT, probably by relieving the inhibition of apical TRPV5/TRPV6 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. This effect is independent of PTH status as well as of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport. The latter observation suggests that factors such as solvent drag and diffusion are not involved.

## Phosphate Depletion

Chronic phosphate depletion impairs $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption at both proximal and distal sites. The effects are independent of the decrease in PTH secretion that follows phosphate depletion; the basis for the effect is otherwise unknown.

diuretics. Clinical manifestations of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ depletion include neurological disturbances such as tetany (especially when associated with hypocalcemia), cardiac arrhythmias, and increased peripheral vascular resistance. Conversely, increased $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ intake may lower blood pressure and may reduce the incidence of hypertension. Severe hypermagnesemia, which may occur following excessive intake or renal failure, results in a toxic syndrome involving nausea, hyporeflexia, respiratory insufficiency, and cardiac arrest.

Normally, $5 \%$ or less of the filtered magnesium load appears in the urine (Fig. 36-17A). In contrast to the predominantly "proximal" reabsorption pattern of the major components of the glomerular filtrate, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption occurs mainly along the TAL.

CCT, cortical collecting tubule; ICT, initial collecting tubule; OMCD, outer medullary collecting duct; PCT, proximal convoluted tubule; PST, proximal straight tubule.

Normally, the proximal tubule reabsorbs only $\sim 15 \%$ of the filtered magnesium load (see Fig. 36-17B). Water reabsorption along the proximal tubule causes luminal $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ to double compared with the value in Bowman's space, thereby establishing a favorable $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ electrochemical gradient for passive, paracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Solvent drag may also contribute to the paracellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$. Because proximal paracellular permeability to $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is significantly less than that to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption is not as sensitive to changes in extracellular volume as is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reabsorption.

The TAL absorbs $\sim 70 \%$ of the filtered magnesium load (see Fig. 36-17C). The driving force for paracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption is the lumen-positive voltage of the TAL (see p. 758).

In the TAL, the tight-junction proteins claudin 16 and claudin 19 (see pp. 43-44) account for the high paracellular cation permeability that is necessary for paracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Mutations of CLDN16 or CLDN19 genes cause an autosomal recessive disorder of severe renal $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ wasting with hypomagnesemia.
$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption along the DCT, which is predominantly transcellular (see Fig. 36-17D), accounts for only $\sim 10 \%$ of the filtered load. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ entry across the apical membrane may take place via the TRPM6 cation channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 5). Because both luminal and intracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ are in the millimolar range, the key driving force is the inside-negative membrane potential. The efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$through apical $\mathrm{Kv} 1.1 \mathrm{~K}^{+}$channels neutralizes the entry of positive charge via $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ uptake. The mechanism of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ extrusion across the basolateral membrane may be secondary active transport by Na-Mg exchange (SLC41A1).

## (2) N36-15

## $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption increases with depletion of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, or with elevated PTH levels

Table 36-9 shows the site of action of factors modulating renal $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ excretion.
$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ Depletion In response to low plasma $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$, the kidney reduces fractional excretion of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ to very low levels $(<2 \%)$. This adaptive response is due to upregulation of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the TAL and DCT.

Hypermagnesemia and Hypercalcemia The kidney seems to discriminate poorly between increases in plasma $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Thus, each of these disturbances inhibits the reabsorption of both $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the TAL, thereby

leading to increased urinary excretion of both $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. It is thought that high plasma $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ each diminish $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption because each cation can bind to the CaSR.

Hormones PTH is the most important hormone for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ regulation, increasing distal $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption. When tested separately in hormone-depleted animals, AVP, glucagon, and calcitonin all stimulate $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the TAL, acting via cAMP and PKA. Many of these hormones probably act by modulating passive $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ movement through the paracellular pathway, either by changing NaCl transport and transepithelial voltage or by increasing paracellular permeability.

Diuretics In general, diuretics decrease $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption and thus enhance $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ excretion. Loop diuretics have effects on $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ similar to those on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and act by depressing the lumen-positive voltage in the TAL and thus the gradient for passive, paracellular $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption. Osmotic diuretics, such as mannitol, also reduce $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption along the loop of Henle. Thiazide diuretics reduce $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption in the DCT, at least in part by indirectly downregulating expression of TRPM6 $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ channels.

## N36-15 Regulation of Magnesium Reabsorption in the DCT

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, and Peter Aronson

Active Mg reabsorption is tonically stimulated by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Identification of patients with syndromes including renal Mg wasting and hypomagnesemia due to mutations in TRPM6, Kv1.1, and EGF support this model. In addition, renal Mg wasting due to mutations in the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter, the $\gamma$ subunit of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, the transcription factor HNF1B that affects $\gamma$ subunit expression, or the basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel Kir 4.1/5.1 suggest that these processes are also required for normal Mg reabsorption.

## Effective Circulating Volume

As is true for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, a decrease in effective circulating volume leads to an increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and an increase in the forces that drive $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption via paracellular pathways. Thus, volume contraction increases $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption, whereas volume expansion has the opposite effect.

## Acid-Base Balance

As is the case for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, alkalosis increases $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ reabsorption. However, for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, the effect is at the level of the TAL.

# TRANSPORT OF POTASSIUM

## POTASSIUM BALANCE AND THE OVERALL RENAL HANDLING OF POTASSIUM

## Changes in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentrations can have major effects on cell and organ function

The distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the body differs strikingly from that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Whereas $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is largely extracellular, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is the most abundant intracellular cation. Some $98 \%$ of the total-body $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content ( $\sim 50 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) is inside cells; only $2 \%$ is in the extracellular fluid (ECF). The body tightly maintains the plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$at 3.5 to 5.0 mM .

Table 37-1 summarizes the most important physiological functions of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions. A high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$inside cells and mitochondria is essential for maintenance of cell volume, for regulation of intracellular pH and control of cell-enzyme function, for DNA and protein synthesis, and for cell growth. The relatively low extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is necessary for maintaining the steep $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient across cell membranes that is largely responsible for the membrane potential of excitable and nonexcitable cells. Therefore, changes in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$can cause severe disturbances in excitation and contraction. As a general rule, either doubling the normal plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$or reducing it by half results in severe disturbances in skeletal and cardiac muscle function. The potentially life-threatening disturbances of cardiac rhythmicity that result from a rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$are particularly important (Box 37-1).

Chronic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion leads to several metabolic disturbances. These include the following: (1) inability of the kidney to form a concentrated urine (Box 38-1); (2) a tendency to develop metabolic alkalosis (pp. 834-835); and, closely related to this acid-base disturbance, (3) a striking enhancement of renal ammonium excretion (pp. 834-835).

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$homeostasis involves external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance between environment and body, and internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance between intracellular and extracellular compartments

Figure 37-1 illustrates processes that govern $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance and the distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the body: (1) gastrointestinal (GI) intake, (2) renal and extrarenal excretion, and (3) the internal distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$between the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments. The first two processes accomplish external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance (i.e., body versus environment), whereas the last achieves internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance (i.e., intracellular versus extracellular fluids).

External $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Balance The relationship between dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion determines external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance. The dietary intake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is approximately equal to that of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, 60 to $80 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake is approximately equal to the entire $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content of the ECF, which is only about 65 to 75 mmol . For the plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content to remain constant, the body must excrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$via renal and extrarenal mechanisms at the same rate as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ingestion. Moreover, because dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake can vary over a wide range, it is important that these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-excretory mechanisms be able to adjust appropriately to variable $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake. The kidney is largely responsible for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion, although the GI tract plays a minor role. The kidneys excrete $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of the daily $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake; the colon excretes $5 \%$ to $10 \%$. Although the colon can adjust its $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion in response to some stimuli (e.g., adrenal hormones, changes in dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, decreased capacity of the kidneys to excrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$), the colon-by itself-is incapable of increasing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion sufficiently to maintain external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ balance.

Internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Balance Maintaining normal intracellular and extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$requires not only the external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ balance just described, but also the appropriate distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$within the body. Most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is inside cellsparticularly muscle cells, which represent a high fraction of body mass-with smaller quantities in liver, bone, and red blood cells. The markedly unequal distribution between the intracellular and extracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content has important quantitative implications. Of the total intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content of $\sim 3000 \mathrm{mmol}$, shuttling as little as $1 \%$ to or from the ECF would cause a $50 \%$ change in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, with severe consequences for neuromuscular function (see Table 37-1).

## Ingested $\mathrm{K}^{+}$moves transiently into cells for storage before excretion by the kidney

What happens when the body is presented with a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load? By far, the most common source of a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load is dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. When one ingests $\mathrm{K}^{+}$salts, both the small intestine (p. 908) and the colon (p. 910) absorb the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Not only can $\mathrm{K}^{+}$come from external sources, but substantial amounts of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$may enter the ECF from damaged tissues (Box 37-2). Such $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ release from intracellular to extracellular fluid can lead to a severe, even lethal, increase in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$(i.e., hyperkalemia). However, even a large meal presents the body with a

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$load that could produce hyperkalemia if it were not for mechanisms that buffer and ultimately excrete this $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

Some four fifths of an ingested $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load temporarily moves into cells, so that plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$rises only modestly, as shown in the upper panel of Figure 37-2. Were it not for this translocation, plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$could reach dangerous
levels. The transfer of excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into cells is rapid and almost complete after an hour (lower panel of Fig. 37-2, gold curve). With a delay, the kidneys begin to excrete the surfeit of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(lower panel of Fig. 37-2, brown curve), removing from the cells the excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$that they had temporarily stored.

![bo10321257579](bo10321257579.jpg)

Figure 37-2 $\mathrm{K}^{+}$handling following an acute $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load. (Data from Cogan MG: Fluid and Electrolytes: Physiology and Pathophysiology. Norwalk, CT, Appleton \& Lange, 1991.)

What processes mediate the temporary uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ into cells during $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loading? As shown in Figure 37-3, the hormones insulin, epinephrine (a $\beta$-adrenergic agonist), and aldosterone all promote the transfer of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from extracellular to intracellular fluid via the ubiquitous $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. (5) N37-1 Indeed, the lack of insulin or a deficient renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system can significantly compromise tolerance to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loading and can predispose to hyperkalemia. Similarly, administering $\beta$-adrenergic blockers (in treatment of hypertension) impairs sequestration of an acute $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load.

Acid-base disturbances also affect internal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$distribution. As a rule, acidemia leads to hyperkalemia as tissues release $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. One can think of this $\mathrm{K}^{+}$release as an "exchange" of intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for extracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, although a single transport protein generally does not mediate this exchange (p. 645). Rather, apparent $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ exchange is most likely the indirect result of two effects of low $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (Fig. 37-4). Extracellular acidosis inhibits $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport, both raising $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]_{i}$ (i.e., lowering $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ ) and lowering $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$. The intracellular acidosis compromises both the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter NKCC 2 , both of which move $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into cells. In addition, low pH , lessens the binding of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to nondiffusible intracellular anions, promoting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux. In parallel, the low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ reduces the supply of intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to be extruded by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and thus inhibits $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. These mechanisms all promote hyperkalemia. (6) N37-2

Conversely, alkalemia causes cells to take up $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and thus leads to hypokalemia. High extracellular pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry into the cell via $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and $\mathrm{Na} /$ $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport. The resulting stimulation of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$

pump then causes hypokalemia by stimulating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transfer into cells. The opposite side of the coin, also appearing as the exchange of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, is the effect of changes in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$on acid-base homeostasis. For example, hyperkalemia causes intracellular alkalosis (p. 645) and extracellular acidosis (p. 835). Conversely, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion causes intracellular acidosis and extracellular alkalosis (pp. 834-835).

In some clinical conditions, an increase in extracellular osmolality induces a transfer into the extracellular space not only of water but also of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. An example of this phenomenon occurs in diabetic patients in whom severe hyperglycemia leads to cell shrinkage and thus a regulatory volume increase (p. 131), resulting in a rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. 9 N37-3

## N37-1 Hormonal Response to Acute $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Loading

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As noted in the text, ingestion of a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-rich meal leads to only small increases in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ because of the actions of insulin, epinephrine, and aldosterone on target tissues (see Fig. 37-3).

As discussed on p. 1039 of the text, increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ depolarize $\beta$ cells in the pancreatic islets, leading to the release of insulin.

As discussed on page 1031, chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla secrete epinephrine and to a lesser extent norepinephrine. Extremely large increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$-so large that they would be fatal-do indeed promote the secretion of the aforementioned catecholamines. Physiological increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ do not. Thus, physiological levels of epinephrine are permissive for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$sequestration.

As discussed on page 1028, increases in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ depolarize glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex, promoting the secretion of aldosterone.

## N37-2 Ability of Inorganic Versus Organic Acids to Cause Hyperkalemia

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, and Peter Aronson

Interestingly, for the same degree of acidemia, mineral acids produce a greater degree of hyperkalemia than do organic acids. This difference occurs because organic anions like lactate enter the cell by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$cotransport. The resulting intracellular acidosis and fall in intracellular bicarbonate will tend to stimulate $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (NBCs; see p. 122) and Na-H exchangers (NHEs; see pp. 123-124) and thereby oppose the inhibitory effects of extracellular acidosis.

# N37-3 Hyperkalemia During Hyperosmolality 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep

In the text, we introduce the example of hyperglycemia-induced hyperkalemia in diabetics. The insulin deficiency, by itself (even without cell shrinkage), will reduce $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake into cells by the Na-K pump and thus lead to hyperkalemia.

In addition, hypertonicity will contribute to hyperkalemia by two possible mechanisms, one likely to be minor and the other major. In the first mechanism (i.e., presumably the minor one), we assume no regulation of cell volume after cell shrinkage. In isosmolal solutions, the net driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in mammalian skeletal muscle is $\left(V_{m}-E_{k}\right)=(-80-[-95])=+15 \mathrm{mV}$ (see Fig. 6-10), where $V_{m}$ is membrane potential and $E_{k}$ is the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. An increase in extracellular osmolality from 300 to 315 mOsm (i.e., a $5 \%$ increase in osmolality)-for example, caused by raising plasma [glucose] from 100 to $400 \mathrm{mg} /$ dL (or from 5 to 20 mM ), which is a large increase-would cause the cell to shrink by $5 \%$ of its initial volume. As a result, intracellular [K] would rise by $5 \%$, thereby causing $E_{k}$ to shift by -1.3 mV in the negative direction and increasing the net electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(i.e., $V_{m}-E_{k}$ ) from +15 mV to +16.3 mV . Assuming $V_{m}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance are unaffected by shrinkage,* $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux would increase by an unimpressive $9 \%$. Thus, this direct effect of cell shrinkage on $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ is likely to be relatively small.

In the second mechanism, we assume that the skeletal muscle cell undergoes a regulatory volume increase (RVI; see p. 131). If the cell responds to the initial $5 \%$ shrinkage in 315 mOsm by returning cell volume to its initial level, the cell will gain 15 mOsm of NaCl (i.e., adding 7.5 mM of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and 7.5 mM of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$). Note that the normal $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ in mammalian skeletal muscle is only -4.2 mM (see Table 6-1) and $E_{O}$ is -89 mV (see Fig. 6-10). Thus, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ will rise from 4.2 mM to $(4.2+7.5)=11.7 \mathrm{mM}$, which is sufficient to shift $E_{O}$ from -89 mV to -61 mV . Because the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance of skeletal muscle is high (approximately one half of total membrane conductance), this shift in $E_{O}$ will cause a major depolarization of skeletal muscle and thereby promote the efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the ECF, contributing in a major way to hyperkalemia.

## The kidney excretes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by a combination of filtration, reabsorption, and secretion

At a normal glomerular filtration rate and at physiological levels of plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, the kidney filters $\sim 800 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, far more than the usual dietary intake of 60 to $80 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. Therefore, to achieve $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance, the kidneys normally need to excrete $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Under conditions of low dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake, the kidneys excrete $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ of filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, so that-with a normal- or low- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diet-the kidneys could in principle achieve $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance by filtration and reabsorption alone. Considering only the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load and external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance, we would have no reason to suspect that the kidneys would be capable of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. However, with a chronic high intake of dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, when the kidneys must rid the body of excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion may exceed $150 \%$ of the total amount of filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Therefore, even if the tubules reabsorb none of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, they must be capable of secreting an amount equivalent to at least $50 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load.

As discussed below, even in the absence of a large dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by the tubules is an important component of urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. Therefore, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$handling is a complex combination of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$filtration at the glomerulus as well as both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption and secretion by the renal tubules.

## POTASSIUM TRANSPORT BY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE NEPHRON

The proximal tubule reabsorbs most of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, whereas the distal nephron reabsorbs or secretes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, depending on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake

Figure 37-5 summarizes the pattern of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport along the nephron under conditions of low or normal/high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ intake. In either case, the kidney filters $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the glomerulus and then extensively reabsorbs it along the proximal tubule $(\sim 80 \%)$ and the loop of Henle ( $\sim 10 \%)$, so that only $\sim 10 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$enters the distal convoluted tubule (DCT). Moreover, in either case, the medullary collecting duct (MCD) reabsorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$handling depends critically on dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in five nephron segments: the DCT, the connecting tubule (CNT), the initial collecting tubule (ICT), the cortical collecting tubule (CCT), and the MCD.

Low Dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$When the body is trying to conserve $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the "classic distal tubule" (i.e., DCT, CNT, and ICT) and CCT all reabsorb $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, so that only a small fraction of the filtered load ( $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ ) appears in the urine (see Fig. 37-5A). In states of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion, this additional $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption can be lifesaving by retrieving from the tubule lumen precious $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ that escaped reabsorption along the proximal tubule and

![bo10621257579](bo10621257579.jpg)

In $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the numbered yellow boxes indicate the fraction of the filtered load that various nephron segments reabsorb, whereas the red box in $\mathbf{B}$ indicates the fraction of the filtered load secreted by the ICT and CCT. The green boxes indicate the fraction of the filtered load that remains in the lumen at these sites. The values in the boxes are approximations that reflect the joint contributions of both juxtamedullary and superficial nephrons.
loop of Henle. Despite the degree to which the kidneys can enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption, they cannot restrict $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loss in the urine as effectively as they can restrict $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$loss. Therefore, a negative $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance and hypokalemia may develop when $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake has been abnormally low for prolonged periods of time.

Normal or High Dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$When external $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance demands that the kidneys excrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the ICT, CCT, and the more proximal portion of the MCD secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the tubule lumen (see Fig. 37-5B). Together, these segments, known as the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretory system, account for most of the urinary excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. It is also this distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretory system that responds to many stimuli that modulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. Even at normal rates of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion ( $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the filtered load), the proximal tubules and loop of Henle first absorb very large amounts of $\mathrm{K}^{+}(\sim 90 \%$ of the filtered load), so that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$appearing in the urine may largely represent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secreted by more distal segments of the nephron.

## Medullary trapping of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$helps to maximize $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ excretion when $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake is high

The kidney traps $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the medullary interstitium, with the interstitial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$being highest at the tip of the papilla and falling toward the cortex. This medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping is the result of three steps along the nephron. First, because interstitial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$rises toward the tip of the papilla, juxtamedullary nephrons, whose long loops of Henle dip into the inner medulla (p. 724), secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$passively into the thin descending limb of the loop of Henle (tDLH). Indeed, analysis of fluid collected from the hairpin bend of the long loops of Henle of juxtamedullary nephrons shows that the amount of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$delivered to the collection site at the hairpin bend can exceed not only the amount of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$present at the end of the proximal tubule, but also the amount of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$filtered. This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion by the tDLH is the first step of a process known as medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling (Fig. 37-6).

The second step of medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling is $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption by the thin (tALH) and thick (TAL) ascending limbs,

![bo10721257579](bo10721257579.jpg)

Figure 37-6 Medullary recycling of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by juxtamedullary nephrons. (MCD, inner medullary collecting duct; OMCD, outer medullary collecting duct.
which deposit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the medullary interstitium. This newly deposited interstitial $\mathrm{K}^{+}$contributes to the high interstitial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. Together, the tALH and TAL of a juxtamedullary loop reabsorb more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$than the descending limb secretes, so that net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption occurs along the loop and thereby contributes to medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping.

The third step of medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling is the reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by the MCDs. Regardless of whether the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system (ICT, CCT, early MCD) reabsorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ (see Fig. 37-5A) or secretes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 37-5B), the medullary collecting ducts reabsorb some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and thereby contribute to medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping.

One would think that-with respect to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretionmedullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling is inefficient because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exits the ascending limb and MCD only to re-enter the nephron upstream, in the tDLH. However, medullary recycling and concomitant $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping may be important in maximizing the excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$when $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake is high. Under these conditions, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system is intense, so that luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the MCD may rise to $\geq 200 \mathrm{mM}$. Thus, enhanced $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping in the medullary interstitium minimizes the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$difference between the MCD
lumen and its peritubular environment, thus reducing the passive loss of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the MCD.

## POTASSIUM TRANSPORT AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVELS

## Passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption along the proximal tubule follows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid movements

The proximal tubule reabsorbs most of the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, a process occurring via two paracellular mechanisms (Fig. 37-7A): electrodiffusion and solvent drag. The passive paracellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by electrodiffusion (pp. 146-147) is very dependent on the luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$and transepithelial voltage $\left(V_{\mathrm{te}}\right)$. Water reabsorption tends to increase $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the lumen, generating a favorable transepithelial gradient that drives passive absorption by diffusion across the paracellular pathway from lumen to blood. Moreover, as fluid flows down the proximal tubule, $V_{\text {te }}$ shifts from lumen negative to lumen positive (see Table 35-1 and p. 759), which also favors $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ reabsorption by electrodiffusion via the low-resistance paracellular pathway.

In addition, some $\mathrm{K}^{+}$may be reabsorbed by solvent drag (p. 467) across tight junctions. The greater the fluid reabsorption along the proximal tubule, the greater the reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$via both electrodiffusion and solvent drag. Indeed, one of the distinguishing features of proximal-tubule $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ reabsorption is its strong dependence on net fluid reabsorption. Thus, interventions that depress fluid reabsorption almost always inhibit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption.

Although the proximal tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$via paracellular pathways, the proximal tubule has several cellular pathways for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement that do not directly participate in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption (see Fig. 37-7A): (1) a basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, a feature common to all tubule cells; (2) apical and basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels; and (3) a basolateral $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (KCC).

The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance of the basolateral membrane greatly exceeds that of the apical membrane, and it appears that different channels are responsible for the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductances in these two membranes. The open probability of the basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel increases sharply with the turnover rate of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. Accordingly, most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$taken up via the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump recycles across the basolateral membrane via $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and a KCC, and does not appear in the lumen. This basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel belongs to the class of inwardly rectifying $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels-ROMK-characterized by ATP sensitivity: a decrease in [ATP], enhances channel activity (p. 198). This regulation by [ATP], is most likely involved in the coupling between basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. An increase in pump rate-which could occur when increased apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry increases $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$-would lower [ATP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{v}}$ relieving inhibition of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Were it not for this crosstalk between the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$content of proximal-tubule cells would fluctuate dramatically during alterations in net $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ transport.

In contrast to the high state of activity of the basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are largely quiescent under normal conditions. They appear to become active, however, when tubule cells swell, possibly when entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the

lumen increases rapidly, such as by $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport. These channels, which may respond to membrane stretch, then allow $\mathrm{K}^{+}$to leave the cell, hyperpolarizing the apical membrane and thereby sustaining the driving force for inward $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport. (○) N37-4

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption along the TAL occurs predominantly via a transcellular route that exploits secondary active $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport

As discussed on page 796, the tDLH of the loops of Henle, particularly those originating from juxtamedullary nephrons, secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 37-6). This secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the medullary interstitium into the tDLH lumen is passive, driven by the high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the medullary interstitium and made possible by a substantial $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability. Both the tDLH lumen and the interstitium become increasingly $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ rich toward the tip of the papilla.

In the tALH, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$moves from lumen to interstitium passively, via the paracellular pathway. The major driving force for this passive reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is the lumen-tointerstitium $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient, which becomes progressively larger as the fluid moves toward the cortex because interstitial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$ becomes progressively lower toward the cortex.

The TAL of the loop of Henle reabsorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$predominantly by a transcellular mechanism (see Fig. 37-7B).

The lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ (pp. 757-758), (○) N37-9 together with the relatively high paracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability, could in principle allow passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption to occur via the paracellular pathway. However, the high interstitial $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$due to medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$trapping opposes this process. Thus, it is uncertain how much $\mathrm{K}^{+}$the TAL reabsorbs via the paracellular pathway.

Most of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption by the TAL occurs via a transcellular pathway using the apical NKCC2 (p. 122). The major evidence for such a mechanism is the mutual interdependence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport. Removing any of the three cotransported ions from the lumen abolishes transcellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption. However, because inhibiting NKCC2 also abolishes the lumen-positive $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ (p. 757), this inhibition also blocks passive, paracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption.

The apical NKCC2 is a typical example of a secondary active transporter (p. 115). Expressed in electrical terms, the apical membrane potential is some 10 to 12 mV more positive than the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$equilibrium potential, so that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$would tend to diffuse passively from cell to lumen. Because the combined inward gradients of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical membrane greatly exceed that of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the energy is adequate for the coupled uptake of all three ion species. Ultimately, a primary active transporter (i.e., Na-K pump) at the basolateral membrane drives the secondary active transport of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in the apical membrane. Inhibiting the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$

# N37-4 Absence of Transcellular $K^{+}$Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule 

Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, and Peter Aronson

Even if the apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels were open more often, uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$across the apical membrane would not occur, because the electrochemical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient favors $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement from cell to lumen. Because $\mathrm{K}^{+}$cannot enter across the apical membrane, no transcellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$can take place. Thus, proximal-tubule $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption must occur exclusively via the paracellular pathway.

pump leads to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$, so that apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ transport ceases. A characteristic feature of NKCC2 is its sensitivity to a class of diuretics that have their main site of action in the TAL. Therefore, administering so-called loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide blocks net reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

The apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance mentioned above-which mainly reflects ROMK (see Table 6-2, family No. 2) and $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ (see Table 6-2, family No. 2)-is also important for the function of NKCC2 (see Fig. 37-7B). The major function of the apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is to provide a mechanism for recycling much of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from cell to lumen, so that luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$does not fall so low as to jeopardize $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport (p. 757). Nevertheless, some of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$entering the cell via NKCC2 exits across the basolateral membrane, which accounts for transcellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption. The presence of apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels also explains why inhibiting $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport-either with loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) or by deletion from the lumen of any of the cotransported ions-causes the TAL to engage in net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake no longer opposes the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$leak from the cell to lumen.

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by principal and intercalated cells of the ICT and CCT involves active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake across the basolateral membrane

The early portion of the classic distal tubule (i.e., DCT) secretes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$but at a relatively low rate. However, a high rate of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion into the tubule fluid is one of the distinguishing features of late portions of the classic distal tubule (i.e., CNT and ICT) and of the CCT. Of the two cell types in the ICT and CCT, it is the principal cell that is mainly responsible for secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and it does so by a transcellular process (see Fig. 37-7C). The three key elements of the principal cell are (1) an $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump for active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake at the basolateral membrane, (2) a relatively high (and variable) apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability due to the ROMK channel, and (3) a favorable electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit across the apical membrane. In addition, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$may move from cell to lumen via an apical KCC (p. 123). The net effects are the active movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from blood to cell and the passive movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from cell to lumen. Changes in any of the three elements can affect the secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

States of high luminal flow (e.g., osmotic diuresis, or administration of thiazide or loop diuretic drugs) increase $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion via a transcellular mechanism involving $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-intercalated cells (p. 729) and principal cells. (5) N37-5 Most of this flow-dependent $\mathrm{K}^{+}$moves from cell to lumen via $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, which are more active when luminal flow increases. This flow dependence of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion helps explain the urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$wasting that frequently occurs during states of high distal flow.

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption by intercalated cells involves apical uptake via an H-K pump

Ultrastructurally, the ICT and CCT are nearly identical (p. 729); they are made up of $\sim 70 \%$ principal cells (which secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) and $\sim 30 \%$ intercalated cells (some of which reabsorb $\mathrm{K}^{+}$).

As discussed above, the ICT, CCT, and MCD reabsorb $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in response to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion (see Fig. 37-5A). This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ reabsorption is transcellular (see Fig. 37-7D), mediated by both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-intercalated cells in two steps: (1) an active step mediated by an apical ATP-driven H-K pump (pp. 117118) similar to that present at the apical membrane of parietal cells in gastric glands (pp. 865-866), and (2) a passive step mediated by a basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, which allows $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ to leak out. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion produces a marked increase in the abundance of H-K pumps, thereby enhancing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption. However, this increase in H-K pump activity tends to accelerate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, which contributes to the development of hypokalemic alkalosis.

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption along the MCD is both passive and active

The capacity for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion diminishes from the cortical to the MCD. Indeed, the MCD is responsible for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption, which contributes to medullary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling (see Fig. 37-6). This $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loss from the MCD lumen can occur by passive movement via the paracellular pathway-which has a significant $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability-driven by a favorable $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration gradient. The luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the MCD is high for two reasons. First, the segments just upstream (i.e., distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system) may have secreted $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Second, the continuing reabsorption of fluid in the medullary collecting tubules, particularly in the presence of high arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels, further increases luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. In addition to passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption, apical $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps (similar to those in intercalated cells, such as the $\alpha$-intercalated cell in Fig. 37-7D) may mediate active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption, especially during low $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake.

## REGULATION OF RENAL POTASSIUM EXCRETION

Table 37-2 summarizes factors that modulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. These may be grouped into luminal and peritubular (i.e., bathing basolateral membrane) factors.

## Increased luminal flow increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

One of the most potent stimuli of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is the rate of fluid flow along the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system (i.e., ICT and CCT). Under almost all circumstances, an increase in luminal flow increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (Fig. 37-8) and a similar relationship holds between final urine flow and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. Accordingly, the increased urine flow that occurs with extracellular volume expansion, osmotic diuresis, or administration of several diuretic agents (e.g., acetazolamide, furosemide, thiazides) leads to enhanced $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ excretion-kaliuresis.

The strong flow dependence of distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is a consequence of enhancements in both the cell-to-lumen $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ gradient and apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability of $\alpha$-intercalated cells (see Fig. 37-7D), $\beta$-intercalated cells, and principal cells (see Fig. 37-7C). When luminal flow is low, the movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ from cell to lumen causes luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$to rise, which opposes further $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diffusion from the cell and limits total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$

# N37-5 Basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Uptake by Intercalated Cells 

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Peter Aronson

In intercalated cells, basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake mainly takes place by $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport. Because these cells have a very low activity of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-independent Na pump may be involved in maintaining the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient needed to drive $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} /$ Cl cotransport at the basolateral membrane.

secretion. When luminal flow increases and sweeps newly secreted $\mathrm{K}^{+}$downstream, the resulting fall in luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$ steepens the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient across the apical membrane and consequently increases passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$flux from cell to lumen. In addition to producing this enhanced gradient, increased luminal flow activates apical $\mathrm{BK}_{\mathrm{Ca}}$ channels, which enhances apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability, as noted above (p. 799).

Increased luminal flow also increases the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to tubule cells, thus raising luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ uptake by principal cells (p. 765). This incremental supply of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the principal cell stimulates its $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, increases basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake, and further increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$sensitivity of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is most pronounced when
luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is $<35 \mathrm{mM}$, as is often the case in the CCT. Almost uniformly, increased urinary flow is associated with increased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (natriuresis), so that the urinary excretion of both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$increases.

## An increased lumen-negative transepithelial potential increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

The apical step of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the ICT and CCT occurs by diffusion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the principal cell to the lumen, a process that depends on the apical electrochemical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$gradient (see Fig. 37-7C). Increases in luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$-enhancing apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry through epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (ENaCs) (pp. 758-759)-depolarize the apical membrane, favoring the exit of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from cell to lumen (i.e., $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion). Conversely, a fall in luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$hyperpolarizes the apical membrane, thereby inhibiting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion.

The diuretic amiloride (pp. 758-759) has the same effect on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion as decreasing luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. By blocking apical ENaCs, amiloride hyperpolarizes the apical membrane and reduces the electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Moreover, by inhibiting apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry, amiloride lowers intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and reduces the activity of the basolateral Na-K pump. Thus, amiloride is a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretic.

## Low luminal [Cl-] enhances $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

Lowering luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-replacing it with an anion (e.g., $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) that the tubule reabsorbs poorly-promotes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ loss into the urine, independent of changes in the lumennegative $V_{\mathrm{ln}}$. Underlying this effect may be a KCC in the apical membrane of the principal cell of the ICT and CCT (see Fig. 37-7C). Lowering luminal $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$increases the cell-to-lumen $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$gradient, which presumably stimulates $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport, and thus $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. (5) N37-6

## Aldosterone increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

Both mineralocorticoids (p. 1026) and glucocorticoids (pp. 1018-1019) cause kaliuresis. Primary hyperaldosteronism leads to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$wasting and hypokalemia, whereas adrenocortical insufficiency (i.e., deficiency of both mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids) leads to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$retention and hyperkalemia.

Mineralocorticoids Aldosterone, the main native mineralocorticoid, induces $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the ICT and CCT, (5) N37-3 particularly when its effects are prolonged. Aldosterone and desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA), a powerful synthetic mineralocorticoid, increase the transcription of genes that enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption and, secondarily, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the principal cells of the ICT and CCT (p. 766). Three factors act in concert to promote $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion. First, over a period of a few hours, aldosterone increases the basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake by stimulating the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. Over a few days, elevated aldosterone levels also lead to a marked amplification of the area of the basolateral membrane of principal cells, as well as to a corresponding increase in the number of $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump molecules. Conversely, adrenalectomy causes a significant reduction in basolateral surface area and $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps in principal cells. Second,

## N37-6 Paradoxical Inhibition of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ Secretion by Thiazide Diuretics in Low- $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$States

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As noted on pages 799-800, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the distal nephron is strongly flow dependent as a result of the high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability of the apical membrane. Figure 37-8 illustrates this effect. Accordingly, all diuretics (e.g., furosemide, thiazides, and acetazolamide) that act proximal to the collecting duct-and thus increase the luminal flow at the level of the collecting ductenhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by the collecting duct. Thus, these diuretics enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion and are termed kaliuretic agents (i.e., they are not " $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing" diuretics).

An exception to this general rule is the administration of thiazide diuretics in low- $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$states (hypochloremia), in which the diuretic inhibits $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. The basis of this paradox is that because luminal $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$is low all along the nephronincluding the CCT-the apical K/Cl cotransporter (KCC) in the CCT (see Fig. 37-7C) makes an unusually large contribution to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in a low- $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$state. When a patient with hypochloremia takes a thiazide diuretic, the drug inhibits the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NCC) in the apical membrane of the DCT, which is illustrated in Figure 35-4C. As a result, luminal $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$is higher than it otherwise would be in the DCT and also downstream in the CCT. In the CCT, the higher-than-otherwise luminal $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$ now acts as a brake on the apical KCC, thereby decreasing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion.

## N37-7 Acute Effects of Intravenous Aldosterone

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

eFigure 37-1 shows the renal effects of intravenously administered aldosterone. The acute effects include significant decreases in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$excretion, as well as increases in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion. The reverse changes occur in adrenalectomy, and the administration of mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) promptly reverses these deficiencies.
![bo11021257579](bo11021257579.jpg)

mineralocorticoids stimulate apical ENaCs (p. 766), thus depolarizing the apical membrane and increasing the driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diffusion from cell to lumen. Third, aldosterone increases the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance of the apical membrane.

Given aldosterone's mechanisms of action, one would think that the renal excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$should always be inversely related. However, the extent to which aldosterone increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion depends strongly on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. For example, when $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake and excretion are low, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention induced by aldosterone reduces luminal flow and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to such low levels that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion fails to increase. In contrast, under high-flow conditions (e.g., with a high $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$load or following administration of diuretics that act on the TAL or the DCT), aldosterone increases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion.

Simultaneous elevation of both aldosterone and angioten$\sin$ II (ANG II) is another example of a case in which $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion are not inversely related. In hypovolemia, when both ANG II and aldosterone levels are high, intracellular kinases, including WNK4 and SPAK, cause activation of ENaC but inhibition of ROMK, so that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption is enhanced without a large increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion-an appropriate adaptive response that tends to restore $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ content with minimal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loss. In contrast, when it is hyperkalemia rather than hypovolemia that increases aldosterone secretion (pp. 1027-1029), ANG II levels do not rise. Here, cell-signaling mechanisms activate both ENaC and ROMK, and appropriately enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion.

Long-term administration of mineralocorticoids or untreated primary hyperaldosteronism leads to a sequence of events known as aldosterone escape. Aldosterone leads to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention and hence volume expansion. Eventually, the volume expansion causes proximal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption to fall (see Fig. 34-10), which increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the ICT and CCT, and ultimately raises $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion toward prealdosterone levels. Thus, the kidney can escape the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-retaining effect of aldosterone, albeit at the price of expanding the extracellular volume and causing hypertension. However, the increased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the principal cells continues to stimulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Once the body has become depleted of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, the aldosterone-stimulated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion eventually wanes, and the distal nephron may return to net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption, but at the price of continued hypokalemia.

Glucocorticoids Under physiological conditions, glucocorticoids enhance $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion (Fig. 37-9). Corticosterone and dexamethasone, a synthetic glucocorticoid, produce this effect largely by increasing flow along the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretory system (i.e., ICT and CCT). Because glucocorticoids increase the glomerular filtration rate and probably lower the water permeability of the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system, they increase the amounts of fluid and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$remaining in these segments. These two flow effects, by themselves, increase $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Indeed, when one perfuses the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$- secretory system at a constant rate, glucocorticoids have no effect on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport.

In addition, administering unphysiologically high doses of glucocorticoids may stimulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport directly as glucocorticoids bind to mineralocorticoid receptors, despite the presence of $11 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 in aldosterone target cells (p. 766).

## High $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake promotes renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

Dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Loading An increase in dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake causes, after some delay, an increase in urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion (see Fig. 37-5B). If the period of high- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake is prolonged, a condition of tolerance ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$adaptation) develops in which the kidneys become able to excrete large doses of

# BOX 37-1 Hyperkalemia and the Heart 

An electrocardiogram (ECG)-a measure of the electrical activity of the myocardial cells (pp. 493-496)-can be clinically useful for detecting rising plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$.

As plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$begins to rise (Fig. 37-9, ECG tracing for 6 mM ), the T wave becomes tall and peaked, assuming a symmetric, "tented" shape. The PR interval becomes prolonged, and the P wave gradually flattens. Eventually, the P wave disappears (see Fig. 37-9, tracing for 8 mM ). Moreover, the QRS complex, which represents depolarization of the ventricles, widens and merges with the $T$ wave, forming a sine-wave pattern. At higher concentrations, ventricular fibrillation, a lethal arrhythmia, may develop (see Fig. 37-9, tracing for 10 mM ). These ECG changes
do not always occur in this precise order, and some patients with hyperkalemia may progress very rapidly to ventricular fibrillation. Any change in the ECG resulting from hyperkalemia requires immediate clinical attention.

Decreases in plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$also affect the ECG. For example, moderate decreases in $\left[K^{+}\right]$to -3 mM cause the QT interval to lengthen and the T wave to flatten. Lower values of $\left[K^{+}\right]$lead to the appearance of a $U$ wave (see Fig. 37-9, tracing for 1.5 mM ), which represents the delayed repolarization of the ventricles. The most severe manifestation of hypokalemia is ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (not shown).

## BOX 37-2 Clinical Implications: Evaluating Hypokalemia and Hyperkalemia in the Patient

Wcan directly apply the physiological principles discussed in this chapter to understanding the common causes and treatment of hypokalemia and hyperkalemia.

## Hypokalemia

The body can lose $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from three sites: the kidneys, the GI tract, and the skin. Renal losses occur most commonly in patients taking diuretics (e.g., furosemide and thiazides) that act at sites upstream to the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system (i.e., ICT, CCT, and proximal portion of MCD). $\mathrm{K}^{+}$losses can also occur in individuals with renal tubule disorders or alterations in the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system (e.g., hyperaldosteronism). Because intestinal secretions have a high $\left[K^{+}\right]$, severe diarrhea is a common cause of hypokalemia. Significant $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion through the skin can occur in two situations: (1) strenuous exercise on a hot, humid day can cause dehydration and hypokalemia from the loss of many liters of perspiration; and (2) severe and extensive burns can result in the transudation of vast amounts of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-containing fluid through the skin. In both cases, the lost fluid is $\mathrm{K}^{+}$rich compared with plasma.

Low plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$can also develop as the result of altered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ distribution within the body without any net loss of whole-body $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Common causes include alkalosis, a catecholamine surge (e.g., as during any acute stress to the body, such as an acute myocardial infarction), and insulin administration without $\mathrm{K}^{+}$repletion during the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Patients may develop hypokalemia because of inadequate dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake. Patients receiving large amounts of intravenous saline (which lacks $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) may also waste $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Some persons in rural areas ingest clay (a behavior called pica), which binds $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the GI tract and prevents $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption.

## Hyperkalemia

Probably the most common cause of a high laboratory value for plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$is pseudohyperkalemia, a falsely elevated value that results from traumatic hemolysis of red blood cells during blood drawing. Red blood cells release their intracellular stores of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the blood sample, and the laboratory reports a falsely elevated plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$. Patients with myeloproliferative disorders associated with greatly increased numbers of platelets or white blood cells can also show a falsely elevated $\left[K^{+}\right]$because of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$released during clot formation within the blood-sample tube.

Excessive intake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$rarely causes hyperkalemia in persons with healthy kidneys. However, even in these individuals, a large $\mathrm{K}^{+}$bolus can cause transient hyperkalemia (see Fig. 37-2, top panel), often from ill-advised use of an inappropriate intravenous fluid. Altered distribution of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$can lead to elevated plasma levels in patients with acidosis and, rarely, as a result of $\beta$-adrenergic blockade. Intoxication with digitalis, a cardiac glycoside that inhibits the Na-K pump (p. 117), is another rare cause of hyperkalemia resulting from $\mathrm{K}^{+}$redistribution. Massive breakdown of cells can release large amounts of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$into the extracellular space. This release can occur in patients with intravascular hemolysis (e.g., from a mismatched blood transfusion), burns, crush injuries, rhabdomyolysis (massive muscle destruction such as can be seen with trauma or sepsis), GI bleeding with subsequent intestinal absorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-rich fluid, or destruction of tumor tissue or leukemic blood cells by chemotherapy.

Impaired renal excretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is the primary cause of a sustained increase in plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$. Hypoaldosteronism (5) N37-8 and high doses of amiloride can be responsible, but advanced renal failure itself, from any myriad of disorders, is the most common cause.

The treatment of hyperkalemia depends on the severity of the problem. For severe hyperkalemia (i.e., $\left[K^{+}\right]>8 \mathrm{mM}$ ) with accompanying ECG changes, the physician immediately infuses calcium gluconate intravenously to counter the electrophysiological effects of the hyperkalemia. (Ca ${ }^{2+}$ raises the threshold for action potentials and lessens membrane excitability). The simultaneous administration of glucose and insulin leads to the uptake of some of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the extracellular to the intracellular space. In addition, if the patient is acidotic, administration of $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ can promote cellular uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. These are all temporizing measures. To remove the excess $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the body, the physician administers an oral nonabsorbable Na-K cation exchange resin (e.g., sodium polystyrene sulfonate). The resin binds the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and carries it out of the body via the GI tract. However, the resin takes several hours to work. Thus, for patients with hyperkalemia and ECG changes, the temporizing measures buy time for the resin to act. For patients with renal failure, dialysis is often necessary to return the plasma $\left[K^{+}\right]$to normal.

# N37-8 Causes of Hypoaldosteronism 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The reason that hypoaldosteronism can cause hyperkalemia is that renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion largely depends on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by the CCT. There, aldosterone is responsible for maintaining high levels of the apical ENaC. Decreased expression of ENaC leads to decreased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$uptake across the apical membrane, less depolarization of the apical membrane, and thus less driving force for the passive diffusion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out across the apical membrane (see Fig. 37-7C).

Bear in mind that aldosterone is synthesized by the glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex (see Figs. 50-1 and 50-2 and the discussion of mineralocorticoids beginning on p. 1026). Causes of hypoaldosteronism include the following:

- Addison disease (in which part of the adrenal gland is destroyed)
- Congenital adrenal hypoplasia
- Deficiency in the enzyme aldosterone synthase (see Fig. 50-2)
- Low-renin states (because the renin-ANG II axis is the major stimulant for aldosterone secretion-see pp. 1027-1029). Examples of patients with low-renin states include otherwise normal older patients (who may have a reduced renin response to orthostasis) and diabetic patients. Another class of low-renin state is drug induced (e.g., secondary to the inhibition of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system, which is a major stimulant of renin release).
- Pseudohypoaldosteronism types 1 and 2. Both cases represent defects in the ability of aldosterone to exert its effects (e.g., defects in the mineralocorticoid receptor or ENaC). In these syndromes, plasma levels of aldosterone are actually higher than normal.

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$-even previously lethal doses-with only a small rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$.

The kaliuresis following an acute or chronic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load is the result of increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the ICT and CCT (compare the three curves in Fig. 37-8 at a single flow), a process that occurs by three mechanisms. First, a transient rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, even if maintained for only short periods, is an effective stimulus for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. The mechanism is increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake across the basolateral membrane of principal cells by the Na-K pump, a response shared by most of the cells of the body. As is the case with mineralocorticoid stimulation, the ultrastructure of the ICT and CCT correlates with changes in the rate of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport induced by high dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Therefore, a high- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diet-independent of the effects of aldosterone-causes surface amplification of the basolateral membrane of principal cells. Second, the increased plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$stimulates glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex to synthesize and release aldosterone (p. 1028). This mineralocorticoid is a potent stimulus for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion both in the kidney by principal cells (p. 799) and in the colon (p. 909). Third, acute $\mathrm{K}^{+}$loading inhibits proximal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid reabsorption and increases flow and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ delivery to the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system, processes that stimulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. In addition, independent of a rise in plasma $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or aldosterone, dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ingestion can stimulate renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion, which suggests a feed-forward mechanism, perhaps involving the sensing of ingested $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by the gut, and the release of humoral factors.

Dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Deprivation In response to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$restriction, the kidneys retain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$(see Fig. 37-5A). The rate of urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ excretion may fall to $1 \%$ to $3 \%$ of the filtered load, via three mechanisms.

First, the low plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$suppresses $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by the principal cells in the ICT and CCT (see Fig. 37-8, lower curve) both by reducing basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake by principal cells and by reducing aldosterone secretion.

Second, low plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$stimulates $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption via H-K pumps of intercalated cells of the ICT and CCT (see Fig. 37-7D). Whereas states of high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (i.e., aldosterone or high- $\mathrm{K}^{+}$diet) amplify the basolateral membrane area of principal cells, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$deprivation amplifies the apical membrane of $\alpha$-intercalated cells. Moreover, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion causes an increased incorporation of rod-shaped particles (presumably representing $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps) in the apical membrane of $\alpha$-intercalated cells, and the density of these particles correlates well with enhanced $\mathrm{K}^{+}$reabsorption.

Third, the MCD responds to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion by increasing its reabsorption of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by enhancing both the activity of its apical H-K pump and its paracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability. As a result, the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the final urine falls sharply, sometimes to levels below that of the plasma. Nevertheless, when the diet is extremely low in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, it may be impossible to maintain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ balance and a normal plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$because urinary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion cannot fall to less than $\sim 15 \mathrm{meq} /$ day.

## Acidosis decreases $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

Acid-base disturbances have marked effects on renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ transport. In general, either metabolic alkalosis (p. 635) or respiratory alkalosis (p. 634) leads to increased $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion.

Conversely, acidosis reduces $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion, although this response is more variable than that to alkalosis. Changes in systemic acid-base parameters affect $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport mainly by acting on the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system.

Alkalosis leads to hypokalemia (p. 794), owing to $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ uptake by cells throughout the body. Despite this fall in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$, alkalosis stimulates $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system, thereby worsening the hypokalemia. Conversely, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion falls acutely in acidosis despite the shift of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from cells to ECF and the concomitant rise in plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$.

The cellular events underlying the renal response to acid-base disturbances most likely involve effects of pH , on both the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and the apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels of the principal cells in the ICT and CCT. Tubule perfusion studies with ${ }^{42} \mathrm{~K}$ indicate that decreasing basolateral pH which also decreases $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ —inhibits the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and thus $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. A fall in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ also inhibits ENaC activity. Even more important is that the decrease in pH , also markedly decreases the open probability of apical ROMK (p. 198) $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (Fig. 37-10). The reverse changes occur in alkalosis.

Changes in tubule flow (i.e., fluid delivery to the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system) that occur in acid-base disturbances may modulate the effects of pH changes per se. For example, metabolic alkalosis increases the flow by delivering an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}^{-}$-rich solution to the ICT and CCT. By itself, this increased flow enhances $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion and thus potentiates the effect of alkalosis per se. Acidosis also increases distal flow, but in this case by inhibiting proximal fluid reabsorption, with the consequence that the tendency of increased flow to increase $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion opposes the effect of acidosis per se to decrease it. Indeed, chronic acidosis, as with inherited renal tubule defects in acid secretion, tends to cause renal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ wasting and hypokalemia (see Box 37-2).

## Epinephrine reduces and AVP enhances $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion

By both extrarenal and renal mechanisms, epinephrine lowers $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion. First, epinephrine enhances $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake by extrarenal tissues (p. 794), thereby lowering plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$ and reducing the filtered $\mathrm{K}^{+}$load. Second, catecholamines directly inhibit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in nephron segments downstream of the ICT.

Although it is not a major regulator of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion, AVP (also known as antidiuretic hormone, or ADH ) can stimulate the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system by two mechanisms (see Fig. 37-7C): (1) AVP increases the apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conductance, thus depolarizing the apical membrane and providing a larger driving force for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux from cell to lumen; and (2) AVP increases apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$permeability. However, AVP also reduces urine flow, and thus inhibits $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Therefore, the two opposing effects-a direct stimulation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion and a flow-related reduction of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion-may cancel each other.

## Opposing factors stabilize $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion

The net effect of a specific disturbance on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion in the final urine often represents a result of two or more interacting factors. Changes in flow often indirectly amplify or

attenuate the direct response of the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system to a given stimulus.

Attenuating Effects Figure 37-11 shows four examples of disturbances affecting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion, the first three of which (acidosis, volume expansion, and high water intake) are characterized by the competition between a direct inhibitory effect on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion and an indirect stimulatory effect of increased flow (see Fig. 37-11A-C). The fourth example, extracellular volume contraction (see Fig. 37-11D), also has two effects on $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. First, volume contraction increases ANG II levels, which in turn increases aldosterone release and hence $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. However, the combination of high angiotensin with high aldosterone (p. 801) may lower ROMK activity, resulting in less $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion than when
aldosterone alone is elevated. Second, hypovolemia decreases distal flow and distal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery, which inhibits the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system. Thus, during hypovolemia, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion tends to remain constant despite the high aldosterone level.

Additive Effects In the following three examples, the direct actions of an agent and flow-related effects are additive.

First, metabolic alkalosis-as discussed-directly stimulates the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system. In addition, the delivery of the poorly reabsorbable $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in metabolic alkalosis increases distal flow, thereby potentiating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion.

Second, hyperkalemia directly stimulates the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretory system. In addition, because increased plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$

inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule, distal flow increases, again potentiating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$excretion.

Third, administration of diuretics that act on a site upstream of the ICT and CCT increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the distal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-secretory system and thereby stimulates $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. In addition, the volume contraction induced by the diuretic raises aldosterone levels, which again potentiates $\mathrm{K}^{+}$
excretion. Hypokalemia is thus a possible harmful side effect of diuretic treatment.

# N37-9 Electrical Profile Across an Epithelial Cell in the TAL 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 5-20B shows the electrical profile typical of a cell from the renal proximal tubule. There, $V_{\mathrm{m}}$ (the transepithelial potential difference) is -3 mV with reference to the interstitial space because the membrane potential of -67 mV across the apical membrane $\left(V_{a}\right)$ is less negative than the membrane potential of -70 mV across the basolateral membrane $\left(V_{b}\right)$.

The situation in the TAL is a right-to-left mirror image of that in Figure 5-20B. A typical $V_{m}$ in the TAL would be +15 mV (see Table 35-1) with reference to the interstitial space. The reason for this lumen-positive $V_{m}$ is that the membrane potential across the apical membrane (e.g., -70 mV ) is more negative than the membrane potential across the basolateral membrane (e.g., -55 mV ).

# URINE CONCENTRATION AND DILUTION 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

## WATER BALANCE AND THE OVERALL RENAL HANDLING OF WATER

The kidney can generate a urine as dilute as 40 mOsm (one seventh of plasma osmolality) or as concentrated as 1200 mOsm (four times plasma osmolality)
In the steady state, water intake and output must be equal (Table 38-1). The body's three major sources of water are (1) ingested water, (2) water contained in the foods eaten, and (3) water produced by aerobic metabolism as mitochondria convert foodstuffs and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see p. 1185).

The major route of water loss is usually through the kidneys, the organs that play the central role in regulating water balance. The feces are usually a minor route of water output (see p. 901). Although the production of sweat can increase markedly during exercise or at high temperatures, sweat production is geared to help regulate body core temperature (see p. 1201), not body water balance. Water also evaporates from the skin and is lost in the humidified air exhaled from the lungs and air passages. The figures summarized in Table 38-1 will obviously vary, depending on diet, physical activity, and the environment (e.g., temperature and humidity).

The kidney adjusts its water output to compensate for either abnormally high or abnormally low water intake, or for abnormally high water losses via other routes. The kidney excretes a variable amount of solute, depending especially on salt intake. However, with consumption of a normal diet, the excreted solute is $\sim 600$ milliosmoles/day. For average conditions of water and solute intake and output, these 600 milliosmoles are dissolved in a daily urine output of 1500 mL . A key principle is that, regardless of the volume of water they excrete, the kidneys must excrete $\sim 600$ milliosmoles/day. Stated somewhat differently, the product of urine osmolality and urine output is approximately constant:

$$
\text { Osmoles excreted } / \text { day }=\underbrace{\mathrm{U}_{\text {Osm }}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Urine } \\
\text { osmolality }
\end{array}} \times \underbrace{\dot{\mathrm{V}}}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Urine } \\
\text { output/day }
\end{array}}
$$

Therefore, to excrete a wide range of water volumes, the human kidney must produce urine having a wide range of osmolalities. For example, when the kidney excretes the 600 milliosmoles dissolved in 1500 mL of urine each day, urine osmolality must be 400 milliosmolar (i.e., 400 mOsm ):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}} & =\frac{\text { osmoles excreted } / \text { day }}{\dot{\mathrm{V}}}=\frac{600 \text { milliosmoles/day }}{15 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }} \\
& =400 \mathrm{mOsm}
\end{aligned}
$$

When the intake of water is especially high, the human kidney can generate urine having an osmolality as low as $\sim 40 \mathrm{mOsm}$. Because the kidneys must still excrete 600 milliosmoles of solutes, the urine volume in an extreme water diuresis would be as high as $\sim 15 \mathrm{~L} /$ day.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathrm{V}} & =\frac{\text { osmoles excreted/day }}{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}}}=\frac{600 \text { milliosmoles/day }}{40 \mathrm{mOsm}} \\
& =15 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }
\end{aligned}
$$

However, when it is necessary to conserve water (e.g., with restricted water intake or excessive loss by sweat or stool), the kidney is capable of generating urine with an osmolality as high as $\sim 1200 \mathrm{mOsm}$. Therefore, with an average solute load, the minimal urine volume can be as low as $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathrm{V}} & =\frac{\text { osmoles excreted/day }}{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}}}=\frac{600 \text { milliosmoles/day }}{1200 \mathrm{mOsm}} \\
& =0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, the kidney is capable of diluting the urine $\sim 7$-fold with respect to blood plasma, but it is capable of concentrating the urine only $\sim 4$-fold. Renal failure reduces both the concentrating and diluting ability.

Free-water clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$ is positive if the kidney produces urine that is less concentrated than plasma and negative if the kidney produces urine that is more concentrated than plasma
A urine sample can be thought of as consisting of two moieties: (1) the volume that would be necessary to dissolve all the excreted solutes at a concentration that is isosmotic with blood plasma, and (2) the volume of pure or solute-free water-or, simply, free water-that one must add (or subtract) to the previous volume to account for the entire urine volume. As discussed below, the kidney generates free water

in the tubule lumen by reabsorbing solutes, mainly NaCl , in excess of water along nephron segments with low water permeability. When the kidney generates free water, the urine becomes dilute (hypo-osmotic). Conversely, when the kidney removes water from an isosmotic fluid, the urine becomes concentrated (hyperosmotic). When the kidney neither adds nor subtracts free water from the isosmotic moiety, the urine is isosmotic with blood plasma.

The urine output is the sum of the rate at which the kidney excretes the isosmotic moiety of urine (osmolal clearance, $\mathrm{C}_{\text {Osm }}$ ) and the rate at which it excretes free water-free-water clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$ :

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}=\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}+\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}
$$

Of course, $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is negative (i.e., excretion of negative free water) if the kidney removes free water and produces a concentrated urine. We compute $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ in the same way we would compute the clearance of any substance from the blood (see p. 731):

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}}
$$

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ is the osmolality of blood plasma. The osmolal clearance is the hypothetical volume of blood that the kidneys fully clear of solutes (or osmoles) per unit time. For example, if the daily solute excretion ( $\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}$ ) is fixed at 600 milliosmoles/day, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ is 300 milliosmoles/L, then Equation 38-6 tells us that $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ has a fixed value of $2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day.

We can obtain the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ only by subtraction:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=\dot{\mathrm{V}}-\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}
$$

Indeed, $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ does not conform to the usual definition of "clearance" because $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is not $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}\right) / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$. Nevertheless, this apparent misnomer has been accepted by renal physiologists and nephrologists. (5) N38-1

The range of $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ values for the human kidney is related to the extremes in urine osmolality, as shown in the three examples that follow.

Isosmotic Urine If the osmolalities of the urine and plasma are the same $\left(\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}\right)$, then osmolal clearance equals urine flow:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}} & =\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}}=\frac{300 \text { milliosmoles } / \mathrm{L} \times 2 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }}{300 \text { milliosmoles } / \mathrm{L}} \\
& =2 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }=\dot{\mathrm{V}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Therefore, Equation 38-7 tells us that the $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ must be zero.
Dilute Urine If the urine is more dilute than plasma ( $\dot{\mathrm{V}}>$ $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ ), the difference between $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ is the positive $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{H}_{2} \mathbf{O}}$. When the kidney maximally dilutes the urine to $\sim 40 \mathrm{mOsm}$, the total urine flow $(\dot{\mathrm{V}})$ must be $\sim 15 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is a positive $13 \mathrm{~L} /$ day (see Equation 38-3):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}} & =\dot{\mathrm{V}}-\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \\
\text { Maximal dilution: } \quad \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}} & =15 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }-2 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day } \\
& =+13 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }

Concentrated Urine If the urine is more concentrated than plasma ( $\dot{\mathrm{V}}<\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ ), then the difference between $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}$ is a negative number, the negative $\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{H}_{2} \mathbf{O}}$. When the kidney maximally concentrates the urine to 1200 mOsm , the total urine flow must be $0.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is a negative $1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day (see Equation 38-4):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}} & =\dot{\mathrm{V}}-\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \\
\text { Maximal concentration: } \quad \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}} & =0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }-2 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day } \\
& =-1.5 \mathrm{~L} / \text { day }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the kidneys can generate a $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ of as much as +13 L/day under maximally diluting conditions, or as little as $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day under maximally concentrating conditions. This wide range of $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ represents the kidneys' attempt to stabilize the osmolality of extracellular fluid in the face of changing loads of solutes or water.

## WATER TRANSPORT BY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE NEPHRON

## The kidney concentrates urine by driving water via osmosis from the tubule lumen into a hyperosmotic interstitium

The kidney generates dilute urine by pumping salts out of the lumen of tubule segments that are relatively impermeable to water. What is left behind is tubule fluid that is hypo-osmotic (dilute) with respect to the blood.

How does the kidney generate concentrated urine? One approach could be to pump water actively out of the tubule lumen. However, water pumps do not exist (see pp. 127128). Instead, the kidney uses osmosis as the driving force

# N38-1 "Effective Osmolal-less" versus "Osmolal-less" Water Clearance 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the text, we define free-water clearance as the clearance of water that is devoid of all solutes. However, if you were interested in how a gain or loss of water would affect cell volume, you would really be interested in the clearance of water that is devoid of impermeant or effective solutes (see discussion of effective osmolality on pp. 132-133). These effective osmoles do not include urea because cells are generally highly permeable to urea, owing to the presence of transport pathways for urea (see p. 770). Therefore, it may be useful to consider the clearance of water that is devoid of all effective osmoles. We will-tongue in cheek-define this as effective osmolal-less water clearance, to distinguish it from classical free-water clearance, which is osmolal-less water clearance.

Urea can be one of the major contributors to urine osmolality $\left(U_{\text {Osm }}\right)$ and thus an important contributor to osmolal clearance $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {Osm }}\right):$

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{Osm}}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\mathrm{Osm}} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{~V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Osm}}}
$$

(NE 38-1)
Equation NE 38-1 above is also Equation 38-6. Because urea equilibrates freely across cell membranes, it does not influence the effective plasma osmolality ( $\mathrm{P}_{\text {effective-Osm }}$ ) nor the distribution of water between cells and the extracellular fluid. Thus, we could
convert Equation NE 38-1 to an expression for effective osmolal clearance by substituting $U_{\text {effective-Osm }}$ for $U_{\text {Osm }}$ and $P_{\text {effective-Osm }}$ for $P_{\text {Osm }}$ in Equation NE 38-1. The resulting new expression for effective osmolal clearance ( $\mathrm{C}_{\text {effective-Osm }}$ ) is

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\text {effective-Osm }}=\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\text {effective-Osm }} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\text {effective-Osm }}}
$$

Note that in both the numerator and the denominator, we are considering only the effective osmoles in urine and plasma.

By analogy to Equation 38-7, the effective osmolal-less water clearance is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{spO}}^{\star}=\dot{\mathrm{V}}-\mathrm{C}_{\text {effective-Osm }} \\
& \text { or } \\
& \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{spO}}^{\star}=\dot{\mathrm{V}}-\frac{\mathrm{U}_{\text {effective-Osm }} \cdot \dot{\mathrm{V}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\text {effective-Osm }}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because plasma levels of urea are generally quite low (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\text {effective-Osm }} \cong \mathrm{P}_{\text {Osm }}$ ), the important issue is the extent to which urea contributes to the total osmolality of the urine (i.e., the extent to which $U_{\text {Osm }}$ exceeds $U_{\text {effective-Osm }}$ ).

Plotted on the $y$-axis is the ratio of the osmolality of the tubule fluid $\left(\mathrm{TF}_{\text {Osm }}\right)$ to the osmolality of the plasma $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\text {Osm }}\right)$, plotted on the $x$-axis is a representation of distance along the nephron.

to concentrate the contents of the tubule lumen. The kidney generates the osmotic gradient by creating a hyperosmotic interstitial fluid in a confined compartment, the renal medulla. The final step for making a hyperosmotic urinecontrolled by regulated water permeability-is allowing the lumen of the medullary collecting duct (MCD) to equilibrate with the hyperosmotic interstitium, resulting in a concentrated urine.

Although net absorption of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ occurs all along the nephron, not all segments alter the osmolality of the tubule fluid. The proximal tubule, regardless of the final osmolality of the urine, reabsorbs two thirds of the filtered fluid isosmotically (i.e., the fluid reabsorbed has nearly the same osmolality as plasma). The loop of Henle and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) reabsorb salt in excess of water, so that the tubule fluid leaving the DCT is hypo-osmotic. Whether the final urine is dilute or concentrated depends on whether water reabsorption occurs in more distal segments: the initial and cortical collecting tubules (ICT and CCT) and the outer and inner medullary collecting ducts (OMCD and IMCD). Arginine vasopressin (AVP)-also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-regulates the variable fraction of water reabsorption in these four nephron segments. Figure $13-9$ shows the structure of AVP.

Tubule fluid is isosmotic in the proximal tubule, becomes dilute in the loop of Henle, and then either remains dilute or becomes concentrated by the end of the collecting duct

Figure 38-1 shows two examples of how tubule-fluid osmolality (expressed as the ratio $\mathrm{TF}_{\text {Osm }} / \mathrm{P}_{\text {Osm }}$ ) changes along the nephron. The first is a case of water restriction, in which the kidneys maximally concentrate the urine and excrete a minimal volume of water (antidiuresis). The second is a case of ingestion of excess water, in which the kidneys produce a large volume of dilute urine (water diuresis). In both cases, the tubule fluid does not change in osmolality along the proximal tubule, and it becomes hypotonic to plasma by the end of the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL), also known as the diluting segment (see pp. 757-758). The fluid exiting the DCT is hypo-osmotic with respect to plasma, regardless of the final urine osmolality (see Fig. 38-1).

Under conditions of restricted water intake or hydropenia, elevated levels of AVP increase the water permeability of the nephron from the ICT to the end of the IMCD. As a result, the osmolality of the tubule fluid increases along the ICT (see Fig. 38-1, red curve), achieving the osmolality of the cortical interstitium-which is the same as the osmolality

of plasma ( $\sim 290 \mathrm{mOsm}$ )-by the end of this nephron segment (also the end of the classic distal tubule in Fig. 38-1). No additional increase in osmolality occurs along the CCT, because the tubule fluid is already in osmotic equilibrium with the surrounding cortical interstitium. However, in the MCDs, the luminal osmolality rises sharply as the tubule fluid equilibrates with the surrounding medullary interstitium, which becomes increasingly more hyperosmotic from the corticomedullary junction to the papillary tip. Eventually the tubule fluid reaches osmolalities that are as much as four times higher than the plasma. Thus, the MCDs are responsible for concentrating the final urine.

In summary, the two key elements in producing a concentrated urine are (1) the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium that provides the osmotic gradient, and (2) the AVP that raises the water permeability of the distal nephron. How the kidney generates this interstitial hyperosmolality is discussed in the next subchapter, and the role of AVP is discussed in the last subchapter.

Under conditions of water loading, depressed AVP levels cause the water permeability of the distal nephron to remain low. However, the continued reabsorption of NaCl along the distal nephron effectively separates salt from water and leaves a relatively hypo-osmotic fluid behind in the tubule lumen. Thus, the tubule fluid becomes increasingly hypoosmotic from the DCT throughout the remainder of the nephron (see Fig. 38-1, blue curve).

## GENERATION OF A HYPEROSMOTIC MEDULLA AND URINE

Understanding the mechanisms involved in forming a hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic urine requires knowing (1) the solute and water permeability characteristics of each tubule segment, (2) the osmotic gradient between the tubule lumen and its surrounding interstitium, (3) the active transport mechanisms that generate the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium, and (4) the "exchange" mechanisms that sustain the hyperosmotic medullary compartment.

## The renal medulla is hyperosmotic to blood plasma during both antidiuresis (low urine flow) and water diuresis

The loop of Henle plays a key role in both the dilution and the concentration of the urine. The main functions of the loop are to remove $\mathrm{NaCl}-$ more so than water-from the lumen and deposit this NaCl in the interstitium of the renal medulla. By separating tubule NaCl from tubule water, the loop of Henle participates directly in forming dilute urine. Conversely, because the TAL deposits this NaCl into the medullary interstitium, thus making it hyperosmotic, the loop of Henle is indirectly responsible for elaborating concentrated urine. As discussed below, urea also contributes to the hyperosmolality of the medulla.

Figure 38-2A shows approximate values of osmolality in the tubule fluid and interstitium during an antidiuresis produced, for example, by water restriction. Figure 38-2B illustrates the comparable information during a water diuresis produced, for example, by high water intake. In both
conditions, interstitial osmolality progressively rises from the cortex to the tip of the medulla (corticomedullary osmolality gradient). The difference between the two conditions is that the maximal interstitial osmolality during antidiuresis, $\sim 1200 \mathrm{mOsm}$ (see Fig. 38-2A), is more than twice that achieved during water diuresis, $\sim 500 \mathrm{mOsm}$ (see Fig. 38-2B).

Because of the NaCl pumped out of the rather waterimpermeable TAL, the tubule fluid at the end of this segment is hypo-osmotic to the cortical interstitium during both antidiuresis and water diuresis. However, beyond the TAL, luminal osmolalities differ considerably between antidiuresis and diuresis. In antidiuresis, the fluid becomes progressively more concentrated from the ICT to the end of the nephron (see Fig. 38-2A). In contrast, during water diuresis, the hypoosmolality of the tubule fluid is further accentuated as the fluid passes along segments from the DCT to the end of the nephron segments that are relatively water impermeable and continue to pump NaCl out of the lumen (see Fig. 38-2B). During antidiuresis, the tubule fluid in the ICT, CCT, OMCD, and IMCD more or less equilibrates with the interstitium, but it fails to do so during water diuresis. This marked difference in osmotic equilibration reflects the action of AVP, which increases water permeability in each of the previously mentioned four segments.

## NaCl transport generates only a $\sim 200-\mathrm{mOsm}$ gradient across any portion of the ascending limb, but countercurrent exchange can multiply this single effect to produce a $900-\mathrm{mOsm}$ gradient between cortex and papilla

Developing and maintaining the hyperosmolality of the medullary interstitium depends on the net transport of NaCl across the rather water-impermeable wall of the ascending limb of the loop of Henle, from lumen to interstitium. This salt reabsorption increases the osmolality of the interstitium and decreases the osmolality of the fluid within the lumen. The limiting NaCl concentration gradient that the tubule can develop at any point along its length is only $\sim 200 \mathrm{mOsm}$, and this concentration alone could not explain the ability of the kidney to raise the osmolality of the papilla to 1200 mOsm . The kidney can achieve such high solute levels only because the hairpin loops of Henle create a countercurrent flow mechanism that multiplies the "single" transverse gradient of 200 mOsm . The result is an osmotic gradient of 900 mOsm along both the axis of the lumen of the ascending limb and the corticomedullary axis of the interstitium. In addition to the hairpin shape of the loop of Henle, a distinct pattern of salt and water permeabilities along the loop of Henle also contributes to osmotic multiplication.

Figure 38-3 illustrates a simplified, schematized model of a countercurrent-multiplier system. (T) N38-2 The kidney in this example establishes a longitudinal osmotic gradient of 300 mOsm from cortex ( 300 mOsm ) to the papilla ( 600 mOsm ) by iterating (i.e., multiplying) a single effect that is capable of generating a transepithelial osmotic gradient of only 200 mOsm . Of course, if we had used more cycles, we could have generated a corticomedullary gradient that was even greater. For example, after 39 cycles in our example, the interstitial osmolality at the tip of the loop of Henle would be $\sim 1200 \mathrm{mOsm}$. Therefore, the countercurrent

# N38-2 Simplifications in the Countercurrent-Multiplier Model in Figure 38-3 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The model shown in Figure 38-3 is simplified in several respects.

- Perhaps the most significant simplification is that we regard the ascending limb as being functionally uniform from bottom to top. In fact, the bottom of the ascending limb is "thin" (tALH), whereas the top is "thick" (TAL). Both the tALH and the TAL separate salt from water, but by very different mechanisms. As discussed in the text, the "single effect" is the result of passive NaCl reabsorption in the thin and active NaCl reabsorption in the thick ascending limb (see p. 811).
- We assume that at every site, the ascending limb establishes a transepithelial gradient of 200 mOsm .
- In Figure 38-3, we separate the generation of the single effect (left column) from the axial movement of fluid along the loop (right column). In fact, the two occur simultaneously.
- Figure 38-3 considers only four cycles rather than the essentially limitless number of cycles in the real kidney. Thus, in our example, we reached an osmolality of only 600 mOsm at the tip of the loop, whereas 1200 mOsm would be a more realistic maximal value. More iterations would generate a larger tip osmolality.
- The model does not include any dissipation of the gradient along the corticomedullary axis by either diffusion or by washout via medullary blood flow. In the text, we noted that after 39 cycles of our model, we would eventually achieve an osmolality of 1200 mOsm at the tip of the loop. What we did not say is that if we had continued with even more iterations, we would have achieved even higher, unrealistic osmolalities. In the real kidney, a balance between the single effect and washout would create a stable corticomedullary gradient of osmolality.

In the last panel of Figure 38-3, we include the collecting duct in the model to show the final event of urine concentration: allowing the fluid in the collecting duct to equilibrate osmotically with the hyperosmotic interstitium produces a concentrated urine.

## The single effect is the result of passive NaCl reabsorption in the thin ascending limb and active NaCl reabsorption in the TAL

So far, we have treated the ascending limb as a functionally uniform epithelium that is capable of generating a 200mOsm gradient between lumen and interstitium across a relatively water-impermeable barrier. However, the bottom of the ascending limb is "thin" (tALH), whereas the top is "thick" (TAL). Both the tALH and the TAL separate salt from water, but they transport the NaCl by very different mechanisms. The TAL moves NaCl from lumen out to interstitium via transcellular and paracellular pathways (see Fig. 35-4B). For the transcellular pathway, the TAL cell takes up $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$via an apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter and exports these ions to the blood using basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels. For the paracellular pathway, the lumen-positive transepithelial voltage drives $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from lumen to blood via the tight junctions. Using these two pathways, the TAL can generate a single effect as large as 200 mOsm .

In contrast, the movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$from the lumen to the interstitium of the tALH appears to be an entirely passive process. During the debate on the mechanism of NaCl reabsorption in the tALH, several investigators pointed out that it was difficult to imagine how the extraordinarily thin cells of the tALH, with their paucity of mitochondria, could perform intensive active solute transport. Because the concentration of NaCl in the lumen exceeds that of the interstitium of the inner medulla, NaCl is reabsorbed passively. The key question for this model is: How did the luminal $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ in the tALH become so high?

The work of concentrating the NaCl in the lumen was performed earlier, when the fluid was in the thin descending limb (tDLH) of juxtamedullary nephrons. This tDLH has three features that allow it to concentrate luminal $\mathrm{NaCl}:$ (1) the tDLH has a high water permeability owing to a high expression of aquaporin 1 (AQP1), (2) the tDLH has a very low permeability to NaCl and a finite urea permeability resulting from the presence of the UT-A2 urea transporter, and (3) the interstitium of the inner medulla has a very high $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ and [urea]. The high interstitial concentrations of NaCl and urea provide the osmotic energy for passively
reabsorbing water, which secondarily concentrates NaCl in the lumen of the tDLH.

In the interstitium, $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right],\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, and [urea] all rise along the axis from the cortex to the papillary tip of the renal medulla (Fig. 38-4). In the outer medulla, a steep rise in interstitial $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$-owing to the pumping of NaCl out of the TAL (see p. 731)-is largely responsible for producing the hyperosmolality. Although urea makes only a minor contribution in the outermost portion of the outer medulla, [urea] rises steeply from the middle of the outer medulla to the papilla. At the tip of the papilla, urea and NaCl each contribute half of the interstitial osmolality. As discussed in the next section, this steep interstitial [urea] profile in the inner medulla (see Fig. 38-4) is the result of the unique water and urea permeabilities of the collecting tubules and ducts (see Fig. 38-2A).

Knowing that NaCl and urea contribute to the high osmolality of the inner medullary interstitium, we can understand how the tDLH passively elevates $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ in the lumen above that in the interstitium. NaCl is the main solute in the lumen at the tip of the papilla but urea contributes to the luminal osmolality. As the luminal fluid turns the corner and moves up the tALH, it encounters a very different epithelium, one that is now impermeable to water but permeable to NaCl . The $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel $\mathrm{ClC}-\mathrm{K} 1$, selectively localized to the tALH, likely plays a pivotal role in this passive NaCl reabsorption. Indeed, mice lacking this channel have a urinary concentration defect. At the tip of the papilla interstitial $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$are each $\sim 300 \mathrm{mM}$ (see Fig. 38-4). Luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, each in excess of 300 mM , provide a substantial gradient for passive transcellular reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. As we see in the next section, urea enters the tALH passively due to a favorable urea gradient and a urea permeability of the tALH larger than that of the tDLH. The entry of urea opposes the osmotic work achieved by the passive reabsorption of NaCl . Even though the mechanism and magnitude of the single effect is different in the tALH and the TAL, the result is the same. At any level, osmolality in the lumen of the ascending limb is lower than it is in the interstitium.

## The IMCD reabsorbs urea, producing high levels of urea in the interstitium of the inner medulla

Because urea comes from protein breakdown, urea delivery to the kidney-and, therefore, the contribution of urea to the medullary hyperosmolality-is larger with consumption of protein-rich diets. Indeed, investigators have long known that the higher the dietary protein content, the greater the concentrating ability.

Urea Handling The renal handling of urea is complex (see pp. 770-772). The kidney filters urea in the glomerulus and reabsorbs about half in the proximal tubule (Fig. 38-5, step

# N38-3 Spectrum of Urinary Concentrating Abilities among Different Mammals 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

The countercurrent-multiplication theory accounts for the observation that the osmolality of the final urine in different species is roughly proportional to the relative length of the loop of Henle. Comparing the absolute lengths of loops of Henle is a gross simplification because of the large variation in the absolute size of kidneys in different species. A better correlation exists between maximal concentrating ability and the ratio of medullary thickness to cortical thickness. For instance, the beaver, whose kidney has no papilla, maximally concentrates the final urine to $\sim 600 \mathrm{mOsm}$ and has a medullary/cortical ratio of 1.3. Humans, on the other hand, achieve a maximal concentration of $\sim 1200 \mathrm{mOsm}$ and have a medullary/cortical ratio of 3.0. Finally, the desert rodent Psammomys, which can achieve a urine osmolality of almost 6000 mOsm , has a medullary/cortical ratio of 10.7 .

Another important factor for explaining interspecies differences in concentrating ability is the fraction of nephrons that have long loops of Henle. This fraction varies from 0\% (i.e., long loops are totally absent) in the beaver to $\sim 14 \%$ in humans to $100 \%$ in the desert rodent Psammomys.

Figure 38-3 Stepwise generation of a high interstitial osmolality by a countercurrent multiplier. This example illustrates in a stepwise fashion how a countercurrent-multiplier system in the loop of Henle increases the osmolality of the medullary interstitium. Heavy boundaries of ascending limb and early DCT indicate that these nephron segments are rather impermeable to water, even in the presence of AVP. The numbers refer to the osmolality (in mOsm) of tubule fluid and interstitium. The top panel shows the starting condition (step 0) with isosmotic fluid ( $\sim 300 \mathrm{mOsm}$ ) throughout the ascending and descending limbs and in the interstitium. Each cycle comprises two steps. N38-2 Step 1 is the "single effect": NaCl transport from the lumen of the ascending limb to the interstitium, which instantaneously equilibrates with the lumen of the descending limb (steps 1, 3, 5, and 7). Step 2 is an "axial shift" of tubule fluid along the loop of Henle (steps 2, 4, and 6), with an instantaneous equilibration between the lumen of the descending limb and the interstitium. Beginning with the conditions in step 0 , the first single effect is NaCl absorption across the rather water-impermeable ascending limb. At each level, we assume that this single effect creates a 200 mOsm difference between the ascending limb (which is water impermeable) and a second compartment: the combination of the interstitium and descending limb (which is water permeable). Thus, the osmolality of the ascending limb falls to 200 mOsm , whereas the osmolality of the interstitium and descending limb rise to 400 mOsm (step 1). The shift of new isosmotic fluid ( $\sim 300 \mathrm{mOsm}$ ) from the proximal tubule in the cortex into the descending limb pushes the column of tubule fluid along the loop of Henle, decreasing osmolality at the top of the descending limb and increasing osmolality at the bottom of the ascending limb. Through instantaneous equilibration, the interstitium-with an assumed negligible volume-acquires the osmolality of the descending limb, thereby diluting the top of the interstitium (step 2). A second cycle starts with net NaCl transport out of the ascending limb (step 3), which again generates an osmotic gradient of 200 mOsm -at each transverse level-between the ascending limb on the one hand and the interstitium and descending limb on the other. After the axial shift of tubule fluid and instantaneous equilibration of the descending limb with the interstitium (step 4), osmolality at the bottom of the ascending limb exceeds that in the preceding cycle. With successive cycles, interstitial osmolality at the tip of the loop of Henle rises progressively from 300 (step 0) to 400 (step 1) to 500 (step 3) to 550 (step 5) and then to 600 mOsm (step 7). Thus, in this example, the kidney establishes a longitudinal osmotic gradient of 300 mOsm from the cortex ( 300 mOsm ) to the papilla ( 600 mOsm ) by iterating (i.e., multiplying) a single effect that is capable of generating a transepithelial osmotic gradient of only 200 mOsm . Step 7A adds the collecting duct and shows the final event of urine concentration: allowing the fluid in the collecting duct to osmotically equilibrate with the hyperosmotic interstitium, which produces a concentrated urine.

1). In juxtamedullary nephrons, the tDLH and the tALH secrete urea into the tubule lumen (see Fig. 38-5, step 2). Some urea reabsorption occurs along the TAL up through the CCT (see Fig. 38-5, step 3). Finally, the IMCD reabsorbs urea (see Fig. 38-5, step 4). The net effect is that the kidney excretes less urea into the urine than it filters. Depending on urine flow (see Fig. 36-2), the fractional excretion may be as low as $\sim 15 \%$ (minimal urine flow) or as high as $\sim 65 \%$ or more (maximal urine flow). Because we are interested in understanding the role of urea in establishing a hyperosmotic medullary interstitium, in Figure 38-5 we consider an example in which maximal AVP produces minimal urine flow (i.e., antidiuresis), a condition already illustrated in Figure 38-2A.

As the tubule fluid enters the TAL, the [urea] is severalfold higher than it is in the plasma because $\sim 100 \%$ of the filtered load of urea remains, even though earlier nephron segments have reabsorbed water. All nephron segments from the TAL to the OMCD, inclusive, have low permeabilities to urea. In the presence of AVP, however, all segments from the ICT to the end of the nephron have high water permeabilities and continuously reabsorb fluid. As a result, luminal [urea] gradually rises, beginning at the ICT and reaching a concentration as much as 8 -fold to 10 -fold higher than that in blood plasma by the time the tubule fluid reaches the end of the OMCD.

The IMCD differs in an important way from the three upstream segments: Although AVP increases only water permeability in the ICT, CCT, and OMCD, AVP increases water and urea permeability in the IMCD. In the IMCD, the high luminal [urea] and the high urea permeabilities of the apical membrane (via the urea transporter UT-A1; see p. 770) and basolateral membrane (via UT-A3) promote the outward
facilitated diffusion of urea from the IMCD lumen, through the IMCD cells, and into the medullary interstitium (see Fig. 38-5, step 4). As a result, urea accumulates in the interstitium and contributes about half of the total osmolality in the deepest portion of the inner medulla. In addition, in the outer portion of the inner medulla, active urea reabsorption occurs via an $\mathrm{Na} /$ urea cotransporter in the apical membrane of the early IMCD.

Because of the accumulation of urea in the inner medullary interstitium, [urea] is higher in the interstitium than it is in the lumen of the tDLH and tALH of juxtamedullary (i.e., long-loop) nephrons. This concentration gradient drives urea into the tDLH via UT-A2 and into the tALH via an unidentified transporter (see Fig. 38-5, step 2). The secretion of urea into the tDLH and tALH accounts for two important observations: First, more urea (i.e., a greater fraction of the filtered load) emerges from the tALH than entered the tDLH. Second, as noted above, [urea] in the TAL is considerably higher than that in blood plasma.

Urea Recycling The processes that we have just described-(1) absorption of urea from IMCD into the interstitium (see Fig. 38-5, step 4), (2) secretion of urea from the interstitium into the thin limbs (see Fig. 38-5, step 2), and (3) delivery of urea up into the cortex and back down via nephron segments from the TAL to the IMCD-are the three elements of a loop. This urea recycling is responsible for the buildup of a high [urea] in the inner medulla. A small fraction of the urea that the IMCD deposits in the interstitium moves into the vasa recta (see Fig. 38-5, step 5), which removes it from the medulla and returns it either to superficial nephrons or to the general circulation.

The preceding discussion focused on the situation in antidiuresis, in which AVP levels are high and the kidney concentrates urea in the inner medulla. The converse situation pertains in water diuresis, when circulating levels of AVP are low. The kidney reabsorbs less water along the ICT, CCT, OMCD, and IMCD. Furthermore, with low AVP levels, the IMCD has lower permeability to both urea and water. In addition, urea may be actively secreted by an apical Na -urea exchanger located in the apical membrane of the most distal portions of the IMCD. Therefore, during water diuresis, the interstitial [urea] is lower, and more urea appears in the urine.

## The vasa recta's countercurrent exchange and relatively low blood flow minimize washout of medullary hyperosmolality

The simplified scheme for the countercurrent multiplier presented in Figure 38-3 did not include blood vessels. If we were simply to introduce a straight, permeable blood vessel running from papilla to cortex, or vice versa, the blood flow would soon wash away the papillary hyperosmolality that is critical for concentrating urine. Figure 38-6A shows a hypothetical kidney with only descending vasa recta. Here, blood would flow from cortex to papilla and then exit the kidney. Because the blood vessel wall is permeable to small solutes and water, the osmolality of the blood would gradually increase from 300 to 1200 mOsm during transit from cortex to papilla, reflecting a loss of water or a gain of

solutes. Because these movements occur at the expense of the medullary interstitium, the blood would wash out the interstitium's hyperosmolality. The greater the blood flow through this straight/unlooped blood vessel, the greater would be the medullary washout.

The kidney solves the medullary-washout problem in two ways. First, compared with the blood flow in the renal cortex, which is one of the highest (per gram of tissue) of any tissue in the body, the blood flow through the medulla is relatively low, corresponding to no more than $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of total renal plasma flow. This low flow represents a compromise between the need to deliver nutrients and oxygen to the medulla and the need to avoid washout of medullary hyperosmolality.

Second, and far more significant, the kidney uses a hairpin configuration, with the descending and ascending vasa recta both entering and leaving through the same region, which creates an efficient countercurrent exchange mechanism (see Fig. 38-6B) in the blood vessels. The vasa recta have a hairpin configuration, but no capacity for active transport.

We start with the osmotic stratification in the medullary interstitium that the countercurrent multiplier generated in the presence of high AVP levels. This osmotic stratification results in part from a gradient of $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, but also from a similarly directed cortex-to-papilla gradient of [urea] (see Fig. 38-4). As isosmotic blood enters the hyperosmotic milieu of the medulla, which has high concentrations of NaCl and urea, NaCl and urea diffuse into the lumen of the descending vasa recta, whereas water moves in the opposite direction. This entry of urea into the descending vasa recta occurs via facilitated diffusion, mediated by the UT-B1 and UT-B2 urea transporters (see p. 770). The result is that the osmolality of the blood increases as the blood approaches the tip of the hairpin loop. As the blood rounds the curve and heads up toward the cortex inside the ascending vasa recta, that blood eventually develops a higher solute concentration than the surrounding interstitium. As a consequence, NaCl and urea now diffuse from the lumen of the vasa recta into the interstitium, whereas water moves into the ascending vasa recta.

# N38-8 Urea Reabsorption in the Distal Nephron 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Of the urea filtered in the glomerulus, the proximal tubule reabsorbs $\sim 50 \%$ by solvent drag (see p. 770), leaving $\sim 50 \%$ remaining in the nephron lumen as the fluid enters the tDLH. As the thin limbs of juxtamedullary nephrons (which make up $\sim 10 \%$ of all nephrons) dip into the inner medulla (remember, these are the only nephrons whose loops of Henle dip into the inner medullasee Figure 33-2), they secrete-under maximal antidiuretic conditions-an amount of urea equivalent to $\sim 50 \%$ of the total filtered load of urea summed over all of the nephrons. In other words, by the time the luminal fluid of juxtamedullary nephrons reaches the beginning of the TAL, the luminal urea content must be an extremely high fraction of the filtered load of these nephrons. The superficial nephrons, on the other hand, have $\sim 50 \%$ of their filtered load of urea remaining (the fraction not reabsorbed by their proximal tubules) by the time their fluid reaches the beginning of their TAL. Averaging over all nephrons-the juxtamedullary nephrons with high urea levels and superficial nephrons with low urea levels-the fluid entering the "average" TAL has an amount of urea that corresponds to $100 \%$ of the total filtered load of urea for the entire kidney. This is the $100 \%$ in the green box that points to the TAL in Figure 38-5.

Figure 38-5 indicates that, by time the tubule fluid reaches the junction of the outer and inner medulla, only $70 \%$ of the total filtered load of urea remains. Because the TAL, DCT, CNT, and CCT all have low urea permeabilities, it is perhaps somewhat surprising that $30 \%$ should have disappeared. Box 3 in the figure shows $30 \%$ of the total filtered load of urea being reabsorbed. Two events contribute to this $30 \%$ : (1) In the relatively few nephrons that are juxtamedullary, the [urea] in the TAL and CCT is very high, providing a gradient for passive urea loss in the cortex, where the interstitial [urea] is little more than that in plasma (i.e., $\sim 5 \mathrm{mM}$ ). (2) In the collecting-duct system, fluid from the many superficial nephrons (each of which has a relatively low amount of its filtered load of urea remaining) admixes with that from the few juxtamedullary nephrons (each of which has far more than its filtered load of urea remaining), producing a blend with an intermediate level of urea remaining. Thus, the admixture of a few hundred percent remaining (from the juxtamedullary nephrons) with $50 \%$ remaining (from the superficial nephrons) contributes to the overall decrease in the percent of urea remaining to $70 \%$.

Figure 38-6 Model of countercurrent exchange. A, If blood simply flows from the cortex to the medulla through a straight tube, then the blood exiting the medulla will have a high osmolality ( 750 mOsm), washing out the osmolality gradient of the medullary interstitium. The numbers in the yellow boxes indicate the osmolality (in mOsm) inside the vasa recta, and the numbers in the green boxes indicate the osmolality of the interstitial fluid. B, If blood flows into and out of the medulla through a hairpin loop, then the water will leave the vessel and solute will enter along the entire descending vessel and part of the ascending vessel. Along the rest of the ascending vessel, the fluxes of water and solute are reversed. The net effect is that the blood exiting the medulla is less hyperosmotic than that in $\mathbf{A}(450$ versus 750 mOsm$)$, so that the kidney better preserves the osmotic gradient in the medulla. The values in the boxes are approximations. (Data from a model in Pitts RF: Physiology of the Kidney and Body Fluids. Chicago, Year Book, 1974.)

Viewed as a whole, these passive exchange processes not only cause the descending vasa recta to gain solute and lose water, but also cause the ascending vessels to lose solute and gain water. Thus, at any level, the descending and ascending vessels exchange solutes and water viaand at the expense of-the medullary interstitium. Solute recirculates from the ascending vessel, through the interstitium, to the descending vessel. Conversely, the countercurrent exchange mechanism also "short-circuits" the water but in the opposite direction, from the descending vessel, through the interstitium, to the ascending vessel. The net effect is that the countercurrent exchanger tends to trap solutes in and exclude water from the medulla, thereby minimizing dissipation of the corticomedullary osmolality gradient. (T) N38-4

The total mass of solute and water leaving the medulla each minute via the ascending vasa recta must exceed the total inflow of solute and water into the medulla via the descending vasa recta. With regard to solute balance, the renal tubules continuously deposit NaCl and urea in the medullary
interstitium. Thus, in the steady state, the vasa recta must remove these solutes lest they form crystals of NaCl and urea in the medullary interstitium. Almost all the urea in the interstitium of the inner medulla comes from the IMCD (see Fig. 38-5, step 4), and in the steady state most of this leaves the interstitium by way of the tALH (see Fig. 38-5, step 2). The blood of the vasa recta carries away the balance or excess urea (see Fig. 38-5, step 5). The vasa recta also carry off the excess NaCl that enters the interstitium from the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and, to some extent, from the MCDs (see Fig. 38-2).

With regard to water balance within the medulla, the descending limb of the loop of Henle and-in the presence of AVP-the MCD continuously give up water to the medullary interstitium (see Fig. 38-2). The ascending vasa recta carry off this excess water from the medulla.

The net effect of managing both solute and water balance in the medulla is that the ascending vasa recta carry out more salt and more water than the descending vasa recta carry in. (T) N38-5

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Although in some species, the ascending and descending vasa recta are closely intermingled in vascular bundles within the medulla, such close contact between the ascending and descending vessels is not necessary to create an effective countercurrent exchanger. It is only necessary that vessels at the same level equilibrate with the same interstitial fluid.

## N38-5 Osmolality of the Ascending versus Descending Vasa Recta

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Eric Windhager

As shown in Figure 38-2A, the net effect of managing both solute and water balance in the medulla is that the ascending vasa recta carry out greater amounts of salt and water than the descending vasa recta carry in. Although no precise measurements have been made, it is likely that the salt concentration-and therefore osmolality-of blood leaving the ascending vasa recta exceeds that of the blood entering the descending vessels by a fairly small amount, perhaps 10 to 30 mOsm .

## The MCD produces a concentrated urine by osmosis, driven by the osmotic gradient between the medullary interstitium and the lumen

Whereas the loop of Henle acts as a countercurrent multiplier and the loop-shaped vasa recta act as a countercurrent exchanger, the MCD acts as an unlooped or straight-tube exchanger. The wall of the MCD has three important permeability properties: (1) in the absence of AVP, it is relatively impermeable to water, urea, and NaCl along its entire length; (2) AVP increases its water permeability along its entire length; and (3) AVP increases its urea permeability along just the terminal portion of the tube (IMCD). The collecting duct traverses a medullary interstitium that has a stratified, everincreasing osmolality from the cortex to the tip of the papilla. Thus, along the entire length of the tubule, the osmotic gradient across the collecting-duct epithelium favors the reabsorption of water from lumen to interstitium.

A complicating factor is that two solutes-NaCl and urea-contribute to the osmotic gradient across the tubule wall. As fluid in the collecting-duct lumen moves from the corticomedullary junction to the papillary tip, the [ NaCl$]$ gradient across the tubule wall always favors the osmotic reabsorption of water (Fig. 38-7). For urea, the situation is just the opposite. However, because the ICT, CCT, and OMCD are all relatively impermeable to urea, water reabsorption predominates in the presence of AVP and gradually

Figure 38-7 Opposing effects of NaCl and urea gradients on urine concentrating ability during antidiuresis. The numbers in the green boxes indicate the osmolalities (in mOsm) of the interstitial fluid.
causes luminal [urea] to increase in these segments. Because the interstitial [urea] is low in the cortex, a rising luminal [urea] in the ICT and CCT opposes water reabsorption in these segments. Even when the tubule crosses the corticomedullary junction, courses toward the papilla, and is surrounded by interstitial fluid with an ever-increasing [urea], the transepithelial urea gradient still favors water movement into the lumen, which is a handicap for the osmotic concentration of the tubule fluid.

The IMCD partially compensates for this problem by acquiring, in response to AVP, a high permeability to urea. The result is a relatively low reflection coefficient for urea ( $\sigma_{\text {urea }} ;$ see p. 468), which converts any transepithelial difference in [urea] into a smaller difference in effective osmotic pressure (see pp. 132-133). Thus, water reabsorption continues from the IMCD even though [urea] in tubule fluid exceeds that in the interstitium. The combination of a high interstitial $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ and high $\sigma_{\mathrm{NaCl}}\left(\sigma_{\mathrm{NaCl}}=1.0\right)$, along with a low $\sigma_{\text {urea }}\left(\sigma_{\text {urea }}=0.74\right)$, promotes NaCl -driven water reabsorption. The high AVP-induced urea permeability has the additional effect of raising interstitial [urea], which further reduces the adverse effect of the high luminal [urea] on water reabsorption.

If luminal urea opposes the formation of a concentrated urine, why did the mammalian kidney evolve to have high levels of urea in the lumen of the collecting tubules and ducts? At least two reasons are apparent. First, because urea is the body's major excretable nitrogenous waste, the kidney's ability to achieve high urinary [urea] reduces the necessity to excrete large volumes of water to excrete nitrogenous waste. Second, as we have already seen, the kidney actually takes advantage of urea-indirectly-to generate maximally concentrated urine. In the presence of AVP, the permeability of the IMCD to urea is high, so that large amounts of urea can enter the medullary interstitium. The high interstitial [urea] energizes the increase in luminal $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ in the tDLH, which, in turn, fuels the single effect in the tALH, thus creating the high inner-medullary $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ that is directly responsible for concentrating the urine.

As discussed above in this section, the composition of the inner medullary interstitium determines the composition of the final urine. However, to some extent, the composition of the final urine, as well as the rate of urine flow, also influences the composition of the interstitium. Figure 38-2 shows that the medullary interstitial osmolality is much lower, and the stratification of osmolality from cortex to papillary tip is much less, during water diuresis than during antidiuresis. Two factors contribute to the lesser degree of osmotic stratification under conditions of water diuresis, when levels of AVP are low. First, less urea moves from the IMCD lumen to the interstitium, both because of the low urea permeability of the IMCD and because of the low water permeability of the upstream segments that would otherwise concentrate urea. Second, the MCDs reabsorb some water despite the low AVP levels, and this water dilutes the medullary interstitium. The reasons for this apparent paradox are as follows: (1) even when AVP is low, the water permeability is not zero; (2) the ICT and CCT present a much larger fluid volume to the MCD, because they reabsorb less water when AVP levels are low; and (3) the tubule fluid is more hypo-osmotic, which results in a larger osmotic gradient for transepithelial water

movement. With low AVP levels, this larger osmotic gradient overrides the effect of the lower water permeability.

Table 38-2 summarizes factors that modulate urinary concentration ability.

## REGULATION BY ARGININE VASOPRESSIN

Large-bodied neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus synthesize AVP, a nonapeptide also known as ADH. These neurons package the AVP and transport it along their axons to the posterior pituitary, where they release AVP through a breech in the blood-brain barrier into the systemic circulation (see pp. 844-845). In Chapter 40, we discuss how increased plasma osmolality and decreased effective circulating volume increase AVP release. AVP has synergistic effects on two target organs. First, at rather high circulating levels, such as those seen in hypovolemic shock, AVP acts on vascular smooth muscle to cause vasoconstriction (see p. 553) and thus to increase blood pressure. Second, and more importantly, AVP acts on the kidney, where it is the major regulator of water excretion. AVP increases water reabsorption by increasing (1) the water permeabilities of the collecting tubules and ducts, (2) NaCl reabsorption in the TAL, and (3) urea reabsorption by the IMCD.

## AVP increases water permeability in all nephron segments beyond the DCT

Of the water remaining in the DCT, the kidney reabsorbs a variable fraction in the segments from the ICT to the end of the nephron. Absorption of this final fraction of water is under the control of circulating AVP.

Figure 38-8 summarizes the water permeability of various nephron segments. The water permeability is highest in the

## TABLE 38-2 Factors that Modulate Urinary Concentration and Dilution

1. Osmotic gradient of medullary interstitium from corticomedullary junction to papilla:
a. Length of loops of Henle: Species with long loops (e.g., desert rodents) concentrate more than those with short loops (e.g., beaver).
b. Rate of active NaCl reabsorption in the TAL: Increased luminal Na ${ }^{+}$delivery to the TAL (high GFR or filtration fraction, and low proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption) enhances NaCl reabsorption, whereas low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery (low GFR, increased proximal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid reabsorption) reduces concentrating ability. High Na-K pump turnover enhances NaCl reabsorption, whereas inhibiting transport (e.g., loop diuretics) reduces concentrating ability.
c. Protein content of diet: High-protein diet, up to a point, promotes urea production and thus accumulation in the inner medullary interstitium, and increased concentrating ability.
2. Medullary blood flow: Low blood flow promotes high interstitial osmolality. High blood flow washes out medullary solutes.
3. Osmotic permeability of the collecting tubules and ducts to water: AVP enhances water permeability and thus water reabsorption.
4. Luminal flow in the loop of Henle and the collecting duct: High flow (osmotic diuresis) diminishes the efficiency of the countercurrent multiplier, and thus reduces the osmolality of the medullary interstitium. In the MCD, high flow reduces the time available for equilibration of water and urea.
5. Pathophysiology: Central diabetes insipidus (DI) reduces plasma AVP levels, whereas nephrogenic DI reduces renal responsiveness to AVP (see Box 38-1).

proximal tubule and tDLH. The constitutively high water permeability in these segments reflects the abundant presence of AQP1 water channels (see p. 110) in the apical and basolateral cell membranes.

In marked contrast to the proximal tubule and tDLH, the following few segments-from the tALH to the connecting tubule-constitutively have very low water permeabilities. In the absence of AVP, the next tubule segments, the ICT and CCT, have rather low water permeabilities, whereas the MCDs are virtually impermeable to water. However, AVP dramatically increases the water permeabilities of the collecting tubules (ICT and CCT) and ducts (OMCD and IMCD) by causing AQP2 water channels to insert into the apical membrane (see below). A third type of water channel, AQP3, is present in the basolateral cell membranes of MCDs. Like AQP1, AQP3 is insensitive to AVP.

Given the favorable osmotic gradients discussed in the preceding subchapter, high levels of AVP cause substantial water reabsorption to occur in AVP-sensitive nephron segments. In contrast, when circulating levels of AVP are low, for instance after ingestion of large amounts of water, the water permeability of these nephron segments remains low. Therefore, the fluid leaving the DCT remains hypo-osmotic as it flows down more distal nephron segments. In fact, in the absence of AVP, continued NaCl absorption makes the tubule fluid even more hypo-osmotic, which results in a large volume of dilute urine (see Fig. 38-1).

## AVP, via cAMP, causes vesicles containing AQP2 to fuse with apical membranes of principal cells of collecting tubules and ducts

AVP binds to $\mathrm{V}_{2}$ receptors in the basolateral membrane of the principal cells from the ICT to the end of the nephron (Fig. 38-9). Receptor binding activates the G, heterotrimeric G protein, stimulating adenylyl cyclase to generate cAMP (see pp. 56-57). The latter activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates AQP2 and additional proteins that play a role in the trafficking of intracellular vesicles containing AQP2 and the fusion of these vesicles with the apical membrane. These water channels are AVP sensitive, not in the sense that AVP increases their single channel water conductance, but rather that it increases their density in the apical membrane. (5) N38-6 In conditions of low AVP, AQP2 water channels are mainly in the membrane of intracellular vesicles just beneath the apical membrane. In the membrane of these vesicles, the AQP2 water channels are present as aggregophores-aggregates of AQP2 proteins. Under the influence of AVP, the vesicles containing AQP2 move to the apical membrane of principal cells of the collecting tubules and ducts. By exocytosis (see pp. 34-35), these vesicles fuse with the apical membrane, thus increasing the density of AQP2. When AVP levels in the blood decline, endocytosis retrieves the water channel-containing aggregates from the apical membrane and shuttles them back to the cytoplasmic vesicle pool.

The apical water permeability of principal cells depends not only on AVP levels but also on certain other factors. For example, high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, and high $\left[\mathrm{Li}^{+}\right]$both inhibit adenylyl cyclase, thus decreasing [cAMP] $\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{c}}$ reducing water permeability, and producing a diuresis. A similar inhibition of AQP2

insertion, and hence a decrease in water permeability, occurs when agents such as colchicine disrupt the integrity of the cytoskeleton. Conversely, inhibitors of phosphodiesterase (e.g., theophylline), which increase [cAMP] $\mathrm{c}_{\mathrm{c}}$ tend to increase the osmotic water permeability. In addition to regulating AQP2 trafficking in and out of the apical membrane in the short term, AVP regulates AQP2 protein abundance over the longer term.

## AVP increases NaCl reabsorption in the outer medulla and urea reabsorption in the IMCD, enhancing urinary concentrating ability

AVP promotes water reabsorption not only by increasing the water permeability of the collecting tubules and ducts, but also by enhancing the osmotic gradients across the walls of the IMCD and perhaps the OMCD. In the outer medulla, AVP acts through the cAMP pathway to increase NaCl reabsorption by the TAL. AVP acts by stimulating apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling across the apical membrane (see p. 768). The net effect is to increase the osmolality of the outer medullary interstitium and thus enhance the osmotic gradient favoring water reabsorption by the OMCD. In addition, AVP stimulates the growth of TAL cells in animals that are genetically devoid of AVP. This hormone also stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the CCT, largely by activating apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (ENaCs). These

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

On page 818, we mentioned that AVP acts through cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) to phosphorylate AQP2 and other proteins. One result of these phosphorylation events is to increase the trafficking of AQP2 from vesicular pools to the apical membrane of the collecting-duct cells. Thus, AVP increases AQP2 density in the apical membrane; that is, the number of water channels per unit area of apical membrane.

In addition, PKA also phosphorylates AQP2 itself as well as cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB; see p. 89). The phosphorylation of CREB, in the longer term, stimulates AQP2 synthesis, as indicated in Figure 38-9.

# BOX 38-1 Diabetes Insipidus 

Diabetes insipidus (DI) is a fairly rare disorder that occurs in two varieties. The first, neurogenic or central DI, is caused by failure of AVP secretion. The lesion can be at the level of either the hypothalamus (where neurons synthesize AVP) or the pituitary gland (where neurons release AVP). Central DI can be idiopathic, familial, or caused by any disorder of the hypothalamus or pituitary, such as injury, a tumor, infection, or autoimmune processes. In the second variety, nephrogenic DI (NDI), the kidneys respond inadequately to normal or even elevated levels of circulating AVP due to familial or acquired defects. Ninety percent of the familial cases are due to mutations in the X-linked AVPR2 gene that encodes the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{X}}$ receptor, and $10 \%$, to mutations in the AQP2 gene. Acquired NDI may be associated with electrolyte abnormalities (e.g., states of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion or high plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ (14), the renal disease associated with sickle cell anemia, and various drugs (notably $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$salts and colchicine).

In both central and nephrogenic DI, patients present with polyuria and polydipsia. If patients cannot gain access to water on their own (e.g., infants, bedridden elderly), the disorder can result in marked hypernatremia, hypotension, and shock. Often the physician first suspects the diagnosis when the patient is deprived of access to water or other fluids. The patient may then quickly become dehydrated, and a random determination of plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$may yield a very high value.

The physician can confirm the diagnosis of DI most easily by a fluid-deprivation test. The patient will continue to produce a large output of dilute urine, despite the need to conserve fluids.

If the patient has central DI, administering a subcutaneous dose of AVP will rapidly increase urine osmolality by $>60 \%$. In patients with nephrogenic DI, on the other hand, the increase in urine osmolality will be less.

The treatment for central DI is desmopressin acetate (DDAVP) (see Fig. 56-10), a synthetic AVP analog that patients can take intranasally. Nephrogenic DI, in which the kidneys are resistant to the effects of the hormone, does not respond to DDAVP therapy. In these patients, it is best to treat the underlying disease. It can also be helpful to administer a diuretic (to produce natriuresis) and restrict dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to induce a state of volume depletion, which in turn enhances proximal NaCl and water reabsorption and thereby moderates the polyuria.

The high urine flow in DI is associated with low rates of solute excretion. Therefore, the physician must distinguish DI from states of polyuria accompanied by high rates of solute excretion in the urine (osmotic diuresis). The most frequent cause of the latter is untreated diabetes mellitus. In that case, the polyuria occurs because the high plasma (glucose) leads to the filtration of an amount of glucose that exceeds the capacity of the proximal tubule to retrieve it from the lumen (see pp. 772-773). Another cause of osmotic diuresis is the administration of poorly reabsorbable solutes, such as mannitol.

In an entirely distinct class of polyurias is primary polydipsia, a psychoneurotic disorder in which patients drink large amounts of fluid. Whereas simple water deprivation benefits a patient with primary polydipsia, it aggravates the condition of a patient with DI.

## BOX 38-2 Role of Aquaporins in Renal Water Transport

$W$hereas AQP1 is the water channel responsible for a large amount of transcellular fluid movement in the proximal tubule and the tDLH, three related isoforms of the water channel protein-AQP2, AQP3, and AQP4-are present in the principal cells of the collecting ducts. These channels regulate water transport in collecting tubules and ducts. Apical AQP2 is the basis for AVP-regulated water permeability. AQP3 and AQP4 are present in the basolateral membrane of principal cells, where they provide an exit pathway for water movement into the peritubular fluid.

Short-term and long-term regulation of water permeability depends on an intact AQP2 system. In short-term regulation, AVP-via cAMP—causes water channel-containing vesicles from a subapical pool to fuse with the apical membrane (see Fig. 38-9). As a result, the number of channels and the water permeability sharply increase. In long-term regulation, AVP-by enhancing transcription of the AQP2 gene-increases the abundance of AQP2 protein in principal cells.

Mutations of several AQP genes lead to loss of function and marked abnormalities of water balance. Examples include sharply decreased fluid absorption along the proximal tubule in AQP1 knockout animals and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (see Box 38-1) in patients with mutations of the gene for AQP2. An interesting situation may develop during the third trimester of pregnancy, when elevated plasma levels of vasopressinasea placental aminopeptidase that degrades AVP-may lead to a clinical picture of central diabetes insipidus.

An acquired increase of AQP2 expression often accompanies states of abnormal fluid retention, such as congestive heart failure, hepatic cirrhosis, nephrotic syndrome, and pregnancy. In addition, some conditions-including acute and chronic renal failure, primary polydipsia, consumption of a low-protein diet, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (see Box 38-3)—are associated with increased AQP2 levels in the apical membrane.
observations on the TAL and CCT were all made on rodents. In humans these TAL and CCT mechanisms may have only minor significance.

In the inner medulla, AVP enhances the urea permeability of the terminal two thirds of the IMCD (see pp. 811813). The AVP-dependent increase in [cAMP], that triggers the apical insertion of AQP2-containing vesicles also leads
to a phosphorylation of apical UT-A1 and basolateral UT-A3 urea transporters (see p. 770), increasing their activity. The result is a substantial increase in urea reabsorption and thus the high interstitial [urea] that is indirectly responsible (see p. 816) for generating the osmotic gradient that drives water reabsorption in the inner medulla (Boxes 38-1, 38-2, and 38-3).

The syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH) is the opposite of diabetes insipidus. Patients with SIADH secrete ADH (i.e., AVP) or AVP-like substances at levels that are inappropriately high, given the low plasma osmolality and lack of hypovolemia. Thus, the urine osmolality is inappropriately high and patients are unable to excrete ingested water loads normally. As a result, total-body water increases, the blood becomes hypo-osmolar, plasma [ $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$] drops (hyponatremia), and cells swell. If plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$falls substantially, cell swelling can cause headaches, nausea, vomiting, and behavioral changes. Eventually, stupor, coma, and seizures may ensue.

Before making the diagnosis of SIADH, the physician must rule out other causes of hyponatremia in which AVP levels may be appropriate. In Chapter 40, we discuss how plasma osmolality (see p. 844) and effective circulating volume (see p. 843) appropriately regulate AVP secretion. SIADH has four major causes:

1. Certain malignant tumors (e.g., bronchogenic carcinoma, sarcomas, lymphomas, and leukemias) release AVP or AVP-like substances.
2. Cranial disorders (e.g., head trauma, meningitis, and brain abscesses) can increase AVP release.
3. Nonmalignant pulmonary disorders (e.g., tuberculosis, pneumonia, and abscesses) and positive-pressure ventilation also can cause SIADH. N38-7
4. Several drugs can either stimulate AVP release (e.g., clofibrate, phenothiazines), increase the sensitivity of renal tubules to AVP (e.g., chlorpropamide), or both (e.g., carbamazepine).
Treatment is best directed at the underlying disorder, combined, if necessary and clinically appropriate, with fluid restriction. Patients with severe hyponatremia and marked symptoms must receive urgent attention. Infusion of hyperosmotic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is usually effective, but the correction must be gradual or severe neurological damage can result owing to rapid changes in the volume of neurons, especially in the pontine area of the brainstem.

# N38-7 Pulmonary Disorders Causing Syndrome of Inappropriate Antidiuretic Hormone Secretion 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Several chronic, nonmalignant pulmonary conditions, including positive-pressure ventilation, impede venous return. The result is reduced stretch of the atrial receptors (see Fig. 23-7). As discussed on page 547, the afferent fibers from these stretch receptors project not only to the medulla (where they produce cardiovascular effects) but also to the hypothalamic neurons that synthesize and release AVP. Decreased atrial stretch increases AVP release. Thus, the aforementioned pulmonary conditions result in a syndrome of inappropriate AVP (ADH) release-SIADH.

# TRANSPORT OF ACIDS AND BASES 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

The lungs and the kidneys are largely responsible for regulating the acid-base balance of the blood (see Chapter 28). They do so by independently controlling the two major components of the body's major buffering system: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ (Fig. 39-1). Chapter 31 focuses on how the lungs control plasma $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$. In this chapter we see how the kidneys control plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$.

## ACID-BASE BALANCE AND THE OVERALL RENAL HANDLING OF ACID

## Whereas the lungs excrete the large amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed by metabolism, the kidneys are crucial for excreting nonvolatile acids

The kidneys play a critical role in helping the body rid itself of excess acid that accompanies the intake of food or that forms in certain metabolic reactions. By far, the largest potential source of acid is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production (Table 39-1, section A), which occurs during oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and most amino acids (see pp. 1185-1187). An adult ingesting a typical Western diet produces $\sim 15,000 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would act as an acid if it went on to form $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see p. 630). Fortunately, the lungs excrete this prodigious amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by diffusion across the alveolar-capillary barrier (see p. 673), preventing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from forming $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

However, metabolism also generates nonvolatile acidssuch as sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, and various organic acids-that the lungs cannot handle (see Table 39-1, section B). In addition, metabolism generates nonvolatile bases, which end up as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Table 39-1, section C). Subtracting the metabolically generated base from the metabolically generated acid leaves a net endogenous $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ production of $\sim 40 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day for a person weighing 70 kg . The strong acids contained in a typical Western acid-ash diet ( $20 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gained) and the obligatory loss of bases in stool ( $10 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$lost) represent an additional acid load to the body of $30 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. Thus, the body is faced with a total load of nonvolatile acids (i.e., not $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) of $\sim 70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day-or $\sim 1 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight-derived from metabolism, diet, and intestinal losses. The kidneys handle this acid load by "dividing" $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$ : excreting $\sim 70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the urine and simultaneously transporting $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of new
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the blood. Once in the blood, this new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ neutralizes the daily load of 70 mmol of nonvolatile acid.

Were it not for the tightly controlled excretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by the kidney, the daily load of $\sim 70 \mathrm{mmol}$ of nonvolatile acids would progressively lower plasma pH and, in the process, exhaust the body's stores of bases, especially $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The result would be death by relentless acidification. Indeed, one of the characteristic symptoms of renal failure is severe acidosis caused by acid retention. (2) N39-1 The kidneys continuously monitor the acid-base parameters of the extracellular fluid (ECF) and adjust their rate of acid secretion to maintain the pH of ECF within narrow limits.

In summary, although the lungs excrete an extremely large amount of a potential acid in the form of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the kidneys play an equally essential role in the defense of the normal acid-base equilibrium, because they are the sole effective route for neutralizing nonvolatile acids.

## To maintain acid-base balance, the kidney must not only reabsorb virtually all filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$but also secrete generated nonvolatile acids

In terms of acid-base balance, the major task of the kidney is to secrete acid into the urine and thus to neutralize the nonvolatile acids that metabolism produces. However, before the kidney can begin to achieve this goal, it must deal with a related and even more serious problem: retrieving from the tubule fluid virtually all $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$filtered by the glomeruli.

Each day, the glomeruli filter 180 L of blood plasma, each liter containing 24 mmol of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, so that the daily filtered load of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is $180 \mathrm{~L} \times 24 \mathrm{mM}=4320 \mathrm{mmol}$. If this filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$were all left behind in the urine, the result would be equivalent to an acid load in the blood of 4320 mmol , or a catastrophic metabolic acidosis (see p. 635). The kidneys avoid this problem by reclaiming virtually all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$through secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the tubule lumen and titration of the $4320 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

After the kidney reclaims virtually all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ (i.e., $4320 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day), how does it deal with the acid load of $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day produced by metabolism, diet, and intestinal losses? If we simply poured 70 mmol of nonvolatile acid into the $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of "unbuffered" urine produced each day, urinary $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$would be $0.070 \mathrm{~mol} / 1.5 \mathrm{~L}=0.047 \mathrm{M}$, which would correspond to a pH of $\sim 1.3$. The lowest urine pH that the kidney

# N39-1 Acidoses of Renal Origin 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Any overall decrease in the ability of the kidneys to excrete the daily load of $\sim 70 \mathrm{mmol}$ of nonvolatile acids will lead to metabolic acidosis. In the strict sense of the term, renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is an acidosis that develops secondary to the dysfunction of renal tubules. In addition, an overall decrease in useful renal mass and GFR-as occurs in endstage renal disease-also leads to an acidosis of renal origin. One system of organizing these maladies recognizes five types of RTAs:

- Uremic acidosis or RTA of glomerular insufficiency. The fundamental problem is a decrease in the total amount of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ that the proximal tubule can synthesize from glutamine (see pp. 829-831).
- Proximal (type 2) RTA. A specific dysfunction of the proximal tubule reduces the total amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that these nephron segments reabsorb.
- Classical distal (type 1) RTA. A specific dysfunction of the distal tubule reduces the total amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that these nephron segments reabsorb. The mechanisms can include mutations of key proteins involved in distal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, such as H pumps and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers.
- Generalized (type 4) RTA. A global dysfunction of the distal tubule-secondary to aldosterone deficiency or aldosterone resistance (see p. 835)-leads to a reduced net excretion of acid.
- Type 3 RTA. Rare defects in CAII lead to defects in both proximal and distal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

## TABLE 39-1 Metabolic Sources of Nonvolatile Acids and Bases

## A. Reactions Producing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (merely a potential acid)

1. Complete oxidation of neutral carbohydrate and fat $\rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$
2. Oxidation of most neutral amino acids $\rightarrow$ Urea $+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

## B. Reactions Producing Nonvolatile Acids

can achieve is $\sim 4.4$, which corresponds to an $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$that is three orders of magnitude lower than required to excrete the $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of nonvolatile acids. The kidneys solve this problem by binding the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to buffers that the kidney can excrete within the physiological range of urinary pH values. Some of these buffers the kidney filters-for example,
phosphate, creatinine, and urate. Because of its favorable $\mathrm{p} K$ of 6.8 and its relatively high rate of excretion, phosphate is the most important nonvolatile filtered buffer. The other major urinary buffer is $\mathrm{NH}_{3} / \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, which the kidney synthesizes. After diffusing into the tubule lumen, the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ reacts with secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. Through adaptive increases in the synthesis of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, the kidneys can respond to the body's need to excrete increased loads of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

The kidney does not simply eliminate the $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of nonvolatile acids by filtering and then excreting them in the urine. Rather, the body deals with the $70-\mathrm{mmol} /$ day acid challenge in three steps:

Step 1: Extracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$neutralizes most of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$load:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\underset{\text { Acid load }}{\mathrm{H}^{+}} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Thus, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$decreases by an amount that is equal to the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$it consumes, and an equal amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is produced in the process. Non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers (see p. 635) in the blood neutralize most of the remaining $\mathrm{H}^{+}$load:

$$
\mathrm{B}^{-}+\underset{\text { Acid load }}{\mathrm{H}^{+}} \rightarrow \mathrm{BH}
$$

Thus, $\mathrm{B}^{-}$, too, decreases by an amount that is equal to the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$it consumes. A very tiny fraction of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$load ( $<0.001 \%$; see Fig. 28-7, panel 2A) escapes buffering by either $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or $\mathrm{B}^{-}$. This remnant $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is responsible for a small drop in the extracellular pH .

TABLE 39-2 Components of Net Urinary Acid Excretion

|  | 1 |  | 2 |  | 3 |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Net urinary acid excretion | Excreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$bound to phosphate (as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}$ ), creatinine, and uric acid | $+$ | Excreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$bound to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$) | - | Excretion of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ |

Step 2: The lungs excrete the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed by the process in Equation 39-1. The body does not excrete the BH generated by the process in Equation 39-2, but rather converts it back into $\mathrm{B}^{-}$, as discussed below.
Step 3: The kidneys regenerate the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{B}^{-}$in the ECF by creating new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at a rate that is equal to the rate of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$production (i.e., $\sim 70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day). Thus, over the course of a day, 70 mmol more $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exits the kidneys via the renal veins than entered via the renal arteries. Most of this new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$replenishes the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$consumed by the neutralization of nonvolatile acids, so that extracellular $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is maintained at $\sim 24 \mathrm{mM}$. The remainder of this new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$regenerates $\mathrm{B}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{BH} \rightarrow \underset{\substack{\text { Regenerated } \\ \text { base }}}{\mathrm{B}^{-}}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

Again, the lungs excrete the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed as indicated in Equation 39-3, just as they excrete the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed by the process in Equation 39-1. Thus, by generating new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the kidneys maintain constant levels of both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and the deprotonated forms of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers ( $\mathrm{B}^{-}$) in the ECF.

Table 39-2 lists the three components of net urinary acid excretion. Historically, component 1 is referred to as titratable acid, the amount of base one must add to a sample of urine to bring its pH back up to the pH of blood plasma. The titratable acid does not include the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$the kidneys excrete as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, which is component 2 . Because the $\mathrm{p} K$ of the $\mathrm{NH}_{3} / \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$equilibrium exceeds 9 , almost all of the total ammonium buffer in the urine is in the form of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, and titrating urine from an acid pH to a pH of 7.4 will not appreciably convert $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. If no filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$were lost in component 3, the generation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$by the kidneys would be the sum of components 1 and 2 . To the extent that filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is lost in the urine, the new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$must exceed the sum of components 1 and 2. (5) N39-2

The kidneys also can control $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{B}^{-}$following an alkaline challenge, produced, for example, by ingesting alkali or by vomiting (which leads to a loss of HCl , equivalent to a gain in $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ). The kidney responds by decreasing net acid excretion-that is, by sharply reducing the excretion rates of titratable acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. The result is a decrease in the production of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. With an extreme alkali challenge, the excretion of urinary $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$also increases and may exceed the combined rates of titratable acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion. In other words, component 3 in Table 39-2 exceeds the sum of components 1 and 2 , so that "net acid excretion" becomes negative, and the kidney becomes a net excretor of alkali. In this case, the kidneys return less $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ to the ECF via the renal veins than entered the kidneys via the renal arteries.

## Secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$titrates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right.$reabsorption) and also titrates filtered non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers and endogenously produced $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$

As we have seen, the kidney can reabsorb nearly all of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and excrete additional acid into the urine as both titratable acid and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. The common theme of these three processes is $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion from the blood into the lumen. Thus, the secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$can have three fates. It can titrate (1) filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, (2) filtered phosphate (or other filtered buffers that contribute to the "titratable acid"), and (3) $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, both secreted and, to a lesser extent, filtered.

Titration of Filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(" $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Reabsorption") Extensive reabsorption reclaims almost all of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ( $>99.9 \%$ ). As discussed beginning on page 825 , the kidney reabsorbs $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at specialized sites along the nephron. However, regardless of the site, the basic mechanism of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption is the same (Fig. 39-2A): $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transported into the lumen by the tubule cell titrates filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ plus $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. One way that this titration can occur is by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ interacting with $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to form $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which in turn dissociates to yield $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. However, the reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ $\rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is far too slow to convert the entire filtered load of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ plus $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA) (5) N18-3-which is present in many tubule segments-bypasses this slow reaction by splitting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ into $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$(see Table 39-1). The secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$neutralizes this $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$so that the net effect is to accelerate the production of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

The apical membranes of these $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-secreting tubules are highly permeable to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, so that the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced in the lumen, as well as the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, diffuses into the tubule cell. Inside the tubule cell, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ regenerate intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$with the aid of CA. Finally, the cell exports these two products, thereby moving the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$out across the apical membrane into the tubule lumen and the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out across the basolateral membrane into the blood. Thus, for each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the lumen, one $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ disappears from the lumen, and one $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$appears in the blood. However, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that disappears from the lumen and the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that appears in the blood are not the same molecule! To secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and yet keep intracellular pH within narrow physiological limits (see pp. 644-645), the cell closely coordinates the apical secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and the basolateral exit of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

Two points are worth re-emphasizing. First, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption does not represent net $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion into the urine. It merely prevents the loss of the filtered alkali. Second, even though $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption is simply a reclamation effort, this process consumes by far the largest fraction of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secreted into the tubule lumen. For example, reclaiming the 4320 mmol of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$filtered each day requires 4320 mmol

# N39-2 Urinary Excretion of Carboxylates 

## Contributed by Peter Aronson and Gerhard Giebisch

In addition to the loss of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the urine, the excretion of organic anions that can undergo conversion to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ (e.g., lactate, citrate) would represent a loss of alkali into the urine, which in principle would need to be taken into account in computing net renal acid excretion. Because the proximal tubule normally reabsorbs nearly all of these carboxylates (see p. 779), this component of alkali loss is minor under most circumstances.

of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, far more than the additional $70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion necessary for neutralizing nonvolatile acids.

Titration of Filtered Non-HCO ${ }_{3}^{-}$Buffers (Titratable-Acid Formation) The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted into the tubules can interact with buffers other than $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. The titration of the non$\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers $\left(\mathrm{B}^{-}\right)$-mainly $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, creatinine, and urate-to their conjugate weak acids (HB) constitutes the titratable acid discussed on page 823.

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{-} \rightarrow \underset{\text { Titratable acid }}{\mathrm{BH}}
$$

The major proton acceptor in this category of buffers excreted in the urine is $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, although creatinine also makes an important contribution; urate and other buffers contribute to a lesser extent. Figure 39-2B shows the fate of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as it protonates phosphate from its divalent form $\left(\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right)$ to its monovalent form $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}\right)$. Because low luminal pH inhibits the apical Na/phosphate cotransporter ( NaPi ) in the proximal tubule, and NaPi carries $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$less effectively than $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ (see pp. 785-786), the kidneys tend to excrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}-$ bound phosphate in the urine. For each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$it transfers to the lumen to titrate $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, the tubule cell generates one new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and transfers it to the blood (see Fig. 39-2B).

How much does the "titratable acid" contribute to net acid excretion? The following three factors determine the rate at which these buffers act as vehicles for excreting acid:

1. The amount of the buffer in the glomerular filtrate and final urine. The filtered load (see p. 732) of $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$, for example, is the product of plasma $\left[\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right]$ and glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Plasma phosphate levels may range from 0.8 to 1.5 mM (see p. 1054). Therefore, increasing plasma $\left[\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}\right]$ allows the kidneys to excrete more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the urine as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$. Conversely, decreasing the GFR (as in chronic renal failure) reduces the amount of $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ available for buffering, lowers the excretion of titratable acid, and thus contributes to metabolic acidosis. Ultimately, the key parameter is the amount of buffer excreted in the urine. In the case of phosphate, the fraction of the filtered load that the kidney excretes increases markedly as plasma [phosphate] exceeds the maximum saturation ( $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{m}}$; see p. 786). For a plasma [phosphate] of 1.3 mM , the kidneys reabsorb $\sim 90 \%$, and $\sim 30 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day appear in the urine.
2. The $\mathbf{p} \boldsymbol{K}$ of the buffer. To be most effective at accepting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the buffer (e.g., phosphate, creatinine, urate) should have a $\mathrm{p} K$ value that is between the pH of the glomerular filtrate and the pH of the final urine. For example, if blood plasma has a pH of 7.4 , then only $\sim 20 \%$ of its phosphate $(\mathrm{p} K=6.8)$ will be in the form of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$(Table 39-3). Even if the final urine were only mildly acidic, with a pH of $6.2, \sim 80 \%$ of the phosphate in the urine would be in the form of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$. In other words, the kidney would

| pH | PHOSPHATE <br> $(\mathrm{p} K=6.8)$ | URATE <br> $(\alpha K=5.8)$ | CREATININE <br> $(\mathrm{p} K=5.0)$ |
| 7.4 | 20.1 | 2.5 | 0.4 |
| 6.2 | 79.9 | 28.5 | 5.9 |

have titrated $\sim 60 \%$ of the filtered phosphate from $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ to $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{+}$. Because creatinine has a $\mathrm{p} K$ of 5.0 , lowering the pH of the tubule fluid from 7.4 to 6.2 increases the fractional protonation of creatinine from $\sim 0.4 \%$ to only $\sim 6 \%$. However, urate has a pK of 5.8 , so lowering pH from 7.4 to 6.2 would increase its fractional protonation from $2.5 \%$ to $28.5 \%$.
3. The $\mathbf{p H}$ of the urine. Regardless of the $\mathrm{p} K$ of the buffer, the lower is the urinary pH , the more protonated is the buffer and the greater is the amount of acid excreted with this buffer. As discussed, lowering the pH of the tubule fluid from 7.4 to 6.2 increases the protonation of creatinine from $0.4 \%$ to only $\sim 6 \%$. However, if the pH of the final urine is 4.4 , the fractional protonation of creatinine increases to $\sim 80 \%$ (see Table 39-3). Thus, creatinine becomes a much more effective buffer during acidosis, when the kidney maximally acidifies the urine.

Titration of Filtered and Secreted $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (Ammonium Excretion) The third class of acceptors of luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. However, unlike either $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or the bases that give rise to "titratable acid" (e.g., $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ ), glomerular filtration contributes only a negligible quantity of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ because plasma $\left[\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]$ concentration is exceedingly low. Instead, urinary $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ derives mainly from diffusion into the lumen from the proximal-tubule cell (see Fig. 39-2C), with some $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ entering the lumen directly via the apical $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger NHE3. In the case of the proximal tubule, the conversion of glutamine to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate $(\alpha-\mathrm{KG})$ generates two $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ ions, which form two $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and two $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions. In addition, the metabolism of $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ generates two $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$ions, which CA converts to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions. This new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$then enters the blood. (5) N39-3

In summary, when renal-tubule cells secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the lumen, this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$simultaneously titrates three kinds of buffers: (1) $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, (2) $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ and other buffers that become the "titratable acid," and (3) $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. Each of these three buffers competes with the other two for available $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. In our example, the kidneys secrete $4390 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the tubule lumen. The kidneys use most of this secreted acid$4320 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day or $\sim 98 \%$ of the total-to reclaim filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The balance of the total secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}, 70 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, the kidneys use to generate new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

## ACID-BASE TRANSPORT BY DIFFERENT SEGMENTS OF THE NEPHRON

Most nephron segments secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to varying degrees.

The nephron reclaims virtually all the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ in the proximal tubule ( $\sim 80 \%$ ), thick ascending limb $(\sim 10 \%)$, and distal nephron ( $\sim 10 \%$ )

The kidney reabsorbs the largest fraction of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ $(\sim 80 \%)$ along the proximal tubule (Fig. 39-3A). By the end of the proximal tubule, luminal pH falls to $\sim 6.8$, which represents only a modest transepithelial $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient compared with the plasma pH of 7.4. Thus, the proximal tubule is a high-capacity, low-gradient system for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. The thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) reabsorbs an additional $10 \%$ of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, so that by the time the tubule fluid reaches the distal convoluted tubule (DCT), the kidney has reclaimed $\sim 90 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The rest of the distal nephron-from the DCT to the inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD)-reabsorbs almost all the remaining $\sim 10 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Although the latter portion of the nephron reabsorbs only a small fraction of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, it can lower luminal pH to $\sim 4.4$. Thus, the collecting tubules and ducts are a low-capacity, high-gradient system for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transport.

The amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$lost in the urine depends on urine pH . If the $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in the urine were the same as that in the blood, and if urine pH were 5.4 , the $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$in the urine would be 0.24 mM , which is $1 \%$ of the 24 mM in blood (see p. 630). For a urine production of $1.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, the kidneys would excrete $0.36 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. For a filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ load of $4320 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, this loss represents a fractional excretion of $\sim 0.01 \%$. In other words, the kidneys reclaim $\sim 99.99 \%$ of the filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Similarly, at a nearly maximally acidic urine pH of 4.4 , urine $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would be only 0.024 mM . Therefore, the kidneys would excrete only $36$ $\mu \mathrm{mol} /$ day of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and would reabsorb $\sim 99.999 \%$.

## The nephron generates new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, mostly in the proximal tubule

The kidney generates new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in two ways (see Fig. 39-3B). It titrates filtered buffers such as $\mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-}$ to produce "titratable acid," and it titrates secreted $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ to $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. In healthy people, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion is the more important of the two and contributes $\sim 60 \%$ of net acid excretion or new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

Formation of Titratable Acid The extent to which a particular buffer contributes to titratable acid (see Fig. 39-2B) depends on the amount of buffer in the lumen and luminal pH . The titratable acid due to phosphate is already substantial at the end of the proximal tubule (Table 39-4), even though the proximal tubule reabsorbs $\sim 80 \%$ of the filtered phosphate. The reason is that the luminal pH equals the $\mathrm{p} K$ of the buffer at the end of the proximal tubule. The titratable acid due to phosphate rises only slightly along the classical distal tubule (i.e., DCT, connecting tubule [CNT], and initial collecting tubule [ICT]), because acid secretion slightly exceeds phosphate reabsorption. The titratable acid due to phosphate rises further as luminal pH falls to 4.4 along the collecting ducts in the absence of significant phosphate reabsorption.

Although the late proximal tubule secretes creatinine, the titratable acid due to creatinine (see Table 39-4) is minuscule at the end of the proximal tubule, because luminal pH is so

# N39-3 Ammonium Secretion by the Medullary Collecting Duct 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager, Gerhard Giebisch, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Ammonium secretion by the medullary collecting duct is critical for renal $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion. As described in Figure 39-5C, the TAL of juxtamedullary nephrons reabsorbs some $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and deposits this $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$in the medullary interstitium, where it is partitioned between ammonium and ammonia according to the equilibrium $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}=$ $\mathrm{NH}_{3}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$. As pointed out in Figure 39-5D, this interstitial $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ) can have three fates: (1) some recycles back to the late proximal tubule and descending thin limb of Henle, (2) some bypasses the cortex by being secreted into the medullary collecting duct, and (3) some is washed out by the blood for export to the liver.

The mechanism of pathway (2) is depicted in Figure 39-5E. $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffuses from the medullary interstitium, through the tubule cell and into the lumen. The $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ moves via members of the Rh family at both the basolateral and apical membranes. The parallel extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the apical membrane of the collecting-duct cell provides the luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that then titrates the luminal $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ to $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, which is excreted. This luminal H pumping also generates $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$inside the cells. Although not shown in Figure 39-5E, intracellular CA converts this newly created $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$(along with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers then export this
newly created $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to the interstitium. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, of course, ultimately is washed out by the blood. Thus, for each $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$formed in the lumen of the collecting duct by this route, the tubule cell transfers one "new" $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to the blood.

Figure 39-5E also shows that the Na-K pump can also transport $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$directly into the collecting-duct cell. This intracellular $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$can then dissociate into $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (which can diffuse into the lumen) and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(which moves into the lumen via the apical H pump), with the ultimate formation of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$in the lumen. The $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ that enters the collecting-duct lumen by this route does not generate a new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion.
eFigure 39-1 shows the most recent model for how the TAL handles $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

much higher than creatinine's pK. However, the titratable acidity due to creatinine increases substantially along the collecting ducts as luminal pH plummets. The urine contains the protonated form of other small organic acids (e.g., uric, lactic, pyruvic, and citric acids) that also contribute to titratable acid.

excretion (see Fig. 39-3B), which is the result of five processes: (1) the proximal tubule actually secretes slightly more than $\sim 40 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, (2) the TAL reabsorbs some $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and deposits it in the interstitium, (3) some of this interstitial $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$recycles back to the proximal tubule and thin descending limb (tDLH), (4) some of the interstitial $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$enters the lumen of the collecting duct, and finally, (5) some of the interstitial $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$enters the vasa recta and leaves the kidney.

## ACID-BASE TRANSPORT AT THE CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR LEVELS

The secretion of acid from the blood to the lumen-whether for reabsorption of filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, formation of titratable acid, or $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion-shares three steps: (1) transport of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(derived from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) from tubule cell to lumen, which leaves behind intracellular $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$; (2) conversion of intracellular $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, catalyzed by CA ; and (3) transport of newly formed $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from tubule cell to blood. In addition, because the buffering power of filtered non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers is not high enough for these buffers to accept sufficient luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the adequate formation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$requires that the kidney generate buffer de novo. This buffer is $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$.

## $\mathrm{H}^{+}$moves across the apical membrane from tubule cell to lumen by Na-H exchange, electrogenic H pumping, and K-H pumping

Although the kidney could, in principle, acidify the tubule fluid either by secreting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or by reabsorbing $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the secretion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$appears to be solely responsible for acidifying tubule fluid. At least three mechanisms can extrude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the apical membrane; not all of these are present in any one cell.

Na-H Exchanger Of the known NHE isoforms (see p. 124), NHE3 is particularly relevant for the kidney because it moves more $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from tubule cell to lumen than any other transporter. ( $\mathbf{N 3 9 - 4}$ NHE3 is present not only throughout the proximal tubule (Fig. 39-4A, B) but also in the TAL (see Fig. 39-4C) and DCT.

The apical NHE3 secretes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in exchange for luminal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Because a steep lumen-to-cell $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient drives this exchange process (see p. 115), apical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion ultimately depends on the activity of the basolateral Na-K pump.

The carboxyl termini of the NHEs have phosphorylation sites for various protein kinases. For example, protein kinase

A (PKA) phosphorylates apical NHE in the proximal tubule, inhibiting it. Both parathyroid hormone and dopamine inhibit NHE3 via PKA.

Electrogenic H Pump A second mechanism for apical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion by tubule cells is the electrogenic H pump, a vacuolar-type ATPase (see pp. 118-119). The ATP-driven H pump can establish steep transepithelial $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration gradients, thus lowering the urine pH to $\sim 4.0$ to 5.0 . In contrast, NHE3, which depends on the 10 -fold $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient across the apical membrane, cannot generate an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient in excess of $\sim 1 \mathrm{pH}$ unit.

The apical electrogenic H pumps are located mainly in a subpopulation of intercalated cells ( $\alpha$ cells) of the CNT, ICT, and cortical collecting tubule (CCT) and in cells of the IMCD and outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD; Fig. $39-4 D$ ). However, H pumps are also present in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule (see Fig. 39-4A, B), the TAL (see Fig. 39-4C), and the DCT. In addition, an electrogenic H pump is also present in the basolateral membrane of $\beta$-intercalated cells. ( $\mathbf{N 3 9 - 5}$ Mutations in genes encoding subunits of this H pump cause a metabolic acidosis (see p. 635) in the blood-a distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA).

The regulation of the apical H pump involves several mechanisms. First, the transepithelial electrical potential may modulate the H pump rate. For instance, aldosterone induces increased apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$uptake by the principal cells in the CCT (see pp. 765-766), thus causing an increase in the lumen-negative potential, which in turn stimulates the H pump. Second, aldosterone stimulates the H pump independently of changes in voltage. Third, acidosis increases the recruitment and targeting of pump molecules to the apical membranes of $\alpha$-intercalated cells in the CNT, ICT and CCT, whereas alkalosis has the opposite effect.

H-K Exchange Pump A third type of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-secretory mechanism is present in the ICT, the CCT, and the OMCD (see Fig. 39-4D): an electroneutral H-K pump (see pp. 117-118) that is related to the Na-K pump. Several isoforms of the H-K pump are present in the kidney and exhibit differential sensitivities to inhibition by drugs such as omeprazole, SCH-28080, and ouabain. The H-K pump probably does not contribute significantly to acid secretion under normal conditions.

## N39-4 Renal NHEs

As described on page 124 of the text, several related genes encode NHEs. (3) NS-20

In the renal proximal tubule, $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange is blocked by the removal of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the lumen. Although all NHEs are far less sensitive to amiloride than the ENaC epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels (see pp. 758-759 and Fig. 35-4D), the apical NHE3 isoform in the proximal tubule is even less amiloride sensitive than the ubiquitous or "housekeeping" NHE1. The NHE1 isoform is present in the basolateral membranes of several nephron segments. The role of basolateral NHEs in acidsecreting nephron segments, such as the proximal tubule, is unclear; they may help regulate pH , independently of transepithelial $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

Given a 10:1 concentration gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the proximal tubule lumen to the cell interior, a maximal pH gradient of 1 pH unit can be achieved by this gradient. Indeed, the late proximal tubule may have a luminal pH as low as $\sim 6.4$.

The NHE2 isoform is present at the apical membrane of the DCT, where it may participate in the apical step of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion.

## N39-5 The $\beta$-Intercalated Cell

## Contributed by Walter Boron, Peter Aronson, and Emile Boulpaep

Electrogenic H pumps are present in $\beta$-intercalated cells (see Fig. 39-9B), which, to a first approximation, are backward $\alpha$-intercalated cells (see Fig. 39-4D). We discuss $\beta$-intercalated cells ( $\beta$-ICs) in the text on page 834.

In $\beta$-ICs, the electrogenic H pump is present in the basolateral membrane, and the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is in the apical membrane. Thus, unlike the $\alpha$-ICs, which engage in net $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ reabsorption, the $\beta$-ICs engage in net $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion.

An interesting difference between the $\alpha$-ICs and the $\beta$-ICs is that in the $\alpha$ cells, the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is a variant of AE1 (the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger in red blood cells, and a member of the SLC4 family), whereas in the $\beta$ cells the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is molecularly quite different, being a member of the SLC26 family.

In addition to the switch from $\alpha$-IC to $\beta$-IC, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion can also be stimulated by increased luminal delivery of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, which promotes the exchange of luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$via the apical $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger.

A molecule by the name of hensin controls the conversion from $\beta$ - to $\alpha$-intercalated cells. Genetic deletion of hensin in the tubule causes a distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) because the mice secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$inappropriately and therefore become $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$deficient in the blood.

However, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion (see p. 803) induces expression of the H-K pump, which retrieves luminal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and, as a side effect, enhances $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. This $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion contributes to the metabolic alkalosis often observed in patients with hypokalemia-hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis.

## CAs in the lumen and cytosol stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by accelerating the interconversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

The CAs (T) N18-3 play an important role in renal acidification by catalyzing the interconversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Inhibition of CAs by sulfonamides, such as acetazolamide, profoundly slows acid secretion. CAs may act at three distinct sites of acid-secreting tubule cells (see Fig. 39-4): the extracellular face of the apical membrane, the cytoplasm, and the extracellular face of the basolateral membrane. Two CAs are especially important for tubule cells. The soluble CA II is present in the cytoplasm, whereas CA IV is coupled via a GPI linkage (see p. 13) to the outside of the apical and basolateral membranes, predominantly in proximal-tubule cells.

Apical CA (CA IV) In the absence of apical CA, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secreted accumulates in the lumen, and $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion are inhibited. By promoting the conversion of luminal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ plus $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, apical CA prevents the lumen from becoming overly acidic and thus substantially
relieves this inhibition. Thus, CA promotes high rates of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption along the early proximal tubule (see Fig. 39-4A).

In the distal nephron (see Fig. 39-4D), $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is less dependent on luminal CA than it is in the early proximal tubule for two reasons. First, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion rate is lower than that in the proximal tubule. Thus, the uncatalyzed conversion of luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ can more easily keep up with the lower $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion rate. Second, in the collecting tubules and ducts the electrogenic H pump can extrude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$against a very high gradient. Therefore, even in the absence of CA, the collecting ducts can raise luminal $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$substantially, thereby accelerating the uncatalyzed reaction by mass action.

Cytoplasmic CA (CA II) Cytoplasmic CA accelerates the conversion of intracellular $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 39-4). As a result, CA II increases the supply of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$for apical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$extrusion and the supply of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$for the basolateral $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exit step. In the CNT, ICT, and CCT, the intercalated cells (which engage in acid-base transport) contain CA II, whereas the principal cells do not.

Basolateral CA (CA IV and CA XII) The role played by basolateral CA IV and CA XII (an integral membrane protein with an extracellular catalytic domain) is not yet understood. (T) N29-6

# N39-6 Carbonic Anhydrase at the Basolateral Membrane 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Although it has been known for years that carbonic anhydrases (CAs) are present at the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule (CA IV, CA XII), only recently has research begun to shed light on the significance of this observation. Two distinct classes of CAs are present near or at the basolateral membrane: (1) the cytosolic or soluble CA II, and (2) one or more membrane-bound CAs (e.g., CA IV, CA XII) with the catalytic domain facing the interstitial fluid. Renal CA XIV is abundant in rodents but is virtually undetectable in human and rabbit kidneys. The role of CA XIV in rodents may be an adaptation to the relatively low activity of rodent CA IV, owing to a G63Q substitution.

## CA II

According to several reports, the soluble CA II binds reversibly to a site on the cytosolic carboxyl termini of certain $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters in the SLC4 family. Among these is the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} /$ $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter NBCe1, which is responsible for the vast majority of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$efflux across the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule (see Fig. 39-4A). According to one viewpoint, the function of the bound CA II is to provide $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$as a substrate for the NBCe1 to export to the basolateral side of the tubule cell according to the reaction

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{CA} \mathrm{II}} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

Published data are consistent with the hypothesis that bound—but not free-CA II increases $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transport.

According to an alternate view that is emerging from the laboratory of Walter Boron, the role of CA II is very different. Preliminary data suggest that NBCe1 transports $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$. Thus, when operating with an apparent $\mathrm{Na}^{+} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of $1: 3$, as it appears to do in the proximal tubule, NBCe1 might actually transport $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, and $1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out of the cell across the basolateral membrane. You might imagine that $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $3 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ ions approach the basolateral membrane from the bulk cytosol. NBCe1 directly extrudes the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The second $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ dissociates to provide the $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ that NBCe1 will export:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

The third $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, in a reaction catalyzed by CA II, produces an $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$,

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{CAII}} \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

(NE 39-3)
and this $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$neutralizes the newly formed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

(NE 39-4)
As a result, NBCe1 would export $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$. Of the original $3 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions that approached the basolateral membrane, 1 carbon atom, 2 hydrogen atoms, and 3 oxygen atoms would be left behind in the cytosol in the form of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. According to the alternate view proposed by the Boron laboratory, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ would exit across the basolateral membrane via another route. Also according to the alternate view, the role of the bound CA II would be to buffer the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions that accumulate on the intracellular side of the membrane as $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ forms from $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Preliminary data from the Boron laboratory indicate that the presence of CA II does not stimulate the electrical current carried by NBCe1, at least as expressed in Xenopus oocytes.

## Extracellular CAs

According to the classical view, the role of CAs that face the basolateral ECF would be to consume the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exported by NBCe1 according to the following reaction:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \xrightarrow{\mathrm{CA}} \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}
$$

(NE 39-5)
According to this view, in consuming the newly exported $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the CA would stimulate the NBCe1.

According to the alternate hypothesis put forward by the Boron laboratory, the role of these extracellular CAs is just the opposite of that of the cytoplasmic CA II. Recall that this hypothesis proposes that NBCe1 directly exports $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}, 1 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, and that $1 \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $1 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ exit by a parallel route. The extracellular CA would assist in the reassembly of $1 \mathrm{CO}_{2}, 1 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, and $1 \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ to form $2 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions, which would then diffuse away from the membrane into the bulk ECF. Indeed, preliminary data show that expressing CA IV on the surface of a Xenopus oocyte greatly reduces the magnitude of the alkalinization produced as NBCe1 exports " $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$" from the cell. Moreover, blocking the CA IV with acetazolamide increases the magnitude of the alkalinization by more than twofold. Finally, preliminary data show that blockade of the CA IV has virtually no effect on the current carried by NBCe1. Thus, it may be that the role of the extracellular CA is not to stimulate NBCe1, but to minimize the size of pH changes on the extracellular surface of the cell.

Inhibition of CA The administration of drugs that block CAs, such as acetazolamide, strongly inhibits $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption along the nephron, leading to the excretion of an alkaline urine. Because acetazolamide reduces the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and water, this drug is also a diuretic (i.e., it promotes urine output). (5) N39-7 However, a small amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption remains despite the complete inhibition of CA. This remaining transport is related in part to the slow uncatalyzed hydration-dehydration reactions and in part to a buildup of luminal $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, which may diffuse into the cell across the apical membrane (mimicking the uptake of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ).

## $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$efflux across the basolateral membrane takes place by electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange

The regulation of the intracellular pH of acid-secreting tubule cells requires that $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion across the apical membrane be tightly linked to, and matched by, the extrusion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$across the basolateral membrane. Two mechanisms are responsible for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transport from the cell into the peritubular fluid: electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange.

Electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Cotransport In proximal-tubule cells, the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter NBCe1 (see p. 122) is responsible for much of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transport across the basolateral membrane. NBCe1 (SLC4A4) is expressed at highest levels in the S1 portion of the proximal tubule (see Fig. 39-4A) and gradually becomes less abundant in the more distal proximal-tubule segments (see Fig. 39-4B). NBCe1 is a 1035 -amino-acid protein with a molecular weight of $\sim 130 \mathrm{kDa} .4,4^{\prime}$-Diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'disulfonate (DIDS), an inhibitor of most $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters, also inhibits NBCe1. Because, in proximal-tubule cells, this transporter usually transports three $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions for each $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion, the electrochemical driving forces cause it to carry these ions from cell to blood. Renal NBCe1 carries two net negative charges and is thus electrogenic. Human mutations that reduce either NBCe1 activity or NBCe1 targeting to the basolateral membrane cause a severe metabolic acidosis-proximal renal tubular acidosis (pRTA). (6) N39-8

Chronic metabolic and respiratory acidosis, hypokalemia, and hyperfiltration all increase NBCe1 activity. As would be expected, several factors cause parallel changes in the activities of the apical NHE3 and basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter, minimizing changes in cell pH and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$. Thus, angiotensin II (ANG II) and protein kinase C (PKC) stimulate both transporters, whereas parathyroid hormone and PKA markedly inhibit both.

CI- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Exchange In the S3 segment of the proximal tubule, as well as in the TAL and collecting tubules and ducts, $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers participate in transepithelial acid-base transport. The AE1 anion exchanger (see pp. 124-125) is found in the basolateral membranes of $\alpha$-intercalated cells of the CNT, the ICT, and the CCT (see Fig. 39-4D). Basolateral AE2 is present in the TAL (see Fig. 39-4C) and the DCT.

## $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$is synthesized by proximal tubules, partly reabsorbed in the loop of Henle, and secreted passively into papillary collecting ducts

As we saw in our discussion of the segmental handling of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(see pp. 826-827 and Fig. 39-3B), the proximal tubule is the main site of renal $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$synthesis, although almost all other tubule segments have the capacity to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. The proximal tubule forms $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$largely from glutamine (Fig. 39-5A), which enters tubule cells both from luminal and peritubular fluid via $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransporters. Inside the mitochondria, glutaminase splits glutamine into $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and glutamate, and then glutamate dehydrogenase splits the glutamate into $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ and a second $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. Ammonium is a weak acid that can dissociate to form $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$. Because the $\mathrm{p} K$ of the $\mathrm{NH}_{3} / \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$equilibrium is $\sim 9.2$, the $\mathrm{NH}_{3} / \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ratio is $1: 100$ at a pH of 7.2 . Whereas the cationic $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$does not rapidly cross most cell membranes, the neutral $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ readily diffuses through most, but not all, cell membranes via gas channels. (7) N39-3 When $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffuses from a relatively alkaline proximal-tubule or collecting-duct cell into the more acidic lumen, the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ becomes "trapped" in the lumen after buffering the newly secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form the relatively impermeant $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(see Fig. 39-5A). Not only does $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffuse across the apical membrane, but the apical NHE3 directly secretes some $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$into the proximal tubule lumen (with $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$taking the place of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$).

A second consequence of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$synthesis is that the byproduct $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$ participates in gluconeogenesis, which indirectly generates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions. As shown in Figure 39-5A, the metabolism of two glutamines generates four $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and two $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$. Gluconeogenesis of these two $\alpha-\mathrm{KG}$, along with four $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, forms one glucose and four $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions. Accordingly, for each $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$secreted into the tubule lumen, the cell secretes one new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the peritubular fluid.

In juxtamedullary nephrons, which have long loops of Henle, the tDLH may both reabsorb and secrete $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, with the secretion dominating. Tubule fluid may become alkaline along the tDLH, titrating $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and promoting $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ reabsorption. On the other hand, reabsorption of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$by the TAL (see following paragraph) creates a gradient favoring $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffusion from the interstitium into the lumen of the tDLH. Modeling of these processes predicts net secretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ into the tDLH in the outer medulla (see Fig. 39-5D). In the thin ascending limb, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$reabsorption may occur by diffusion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$into the interstitium.

In contrast to the earlier segments, the TAL reabsorbs $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(see Fig. 39-5C). Thus, much of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$secreted by the proximal tubule and tDLH does not reach the DCT. Because the apical membrane of the TAL is unusual in having a very low $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ permeability, the TAL takes up $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ across the apical membrane by using two transport mechanisms, the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter and the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Indeed, inhibiting the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter blocks a significant fraction of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$reabsorption, which suggests that $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$can replace $\mathrm{K}^{+}$on the cotransporter. Ammonium leaves the cell across the basolateral membrane-probably as $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, via a gas channel, and as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$carried by the NHE-which leads to accumulation of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$in the renal medulla.

The $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$that has accumulated in the interstitium of the medulla has three possible fates (see Fig. 39-5D). First,

# N39-7 Diuretic Action of the CA Inhibitor Acetazolamide 

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

As described in Box 40-3 and in Table 40-3, the drug acetazolamide (a potent inhibitor of CAs) produces diuresis by inhibiting the component of proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption that is coupled to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption.

For further discussion of CAs, consult $\bigcirc$ N18-3.

## N39-8 The Electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ Cotransporter NBCe1

## Contributed by Walter Boron

NBCe1 is a member of the SLC4 family of solute transporters. It is believed that all of the family members have the same topology: (1) a large cytoplasmic N terminus ( Nt ) that comprises about $40 \%$ of the protein, (2) a large transmembrane domain (TMD) that includes 10 to 14 transmembrane segments (TMs) and comprises $\sim 50 \%$ of the protein, and (3) a short cytoplasmic $C$ terminus (Ct) that comprises $\sim 10 \%$ of the protein.

The gene SLC4A4 encodes three known variants of NBCe1, which differ from one another at their extreme Nt and Ct . The proximal tubule expresses the variant NBCe1-A, which has a very high functional activity. The other variants-the more ubiquitous NBCe1-B and the "brain" form NBCe1-C-have a different Nt. This difference endows these transporters with a low functional activity-due to either reduced trafficking to the membrane or reduced intrinsic activity. However, a soluble protein called IRBIT appear to reverse this inhibition. The NBCe1-A variant in the proximal tubule, however, is the fast variant.

In the proximal tubule, NBCe1-A appears to operate with a stoichiometry of $1 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$for $3 \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions. Thus, each transport event moves two negative charges out of the cell and thereby makes the basolateral membrane potential $\left(V_{b}\right)$ more positive. The reversal potential for NBCe1-A is very close to $V_{b}$. Accordingly, cell depolarization inhibits $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ efflux or can even reverse the direction of transport and cause basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ uptake.

At least 10 naturally occurring human mutations of NBCe1 are known. From a molecular perspective, these mutations cause
poor function or poor targeting to the appropriate plasma membrane (i.e., the basolateral membrane in the case of NBCe1-A in the proximal-tubule cell). From a clinical perspective, these naturally occurring mutations have a devastating effect on the patient, causing a severe pRTA and other problems that maydepending on the mutation-lead to short stature, mental retardation, and ocular deficits.

Figure 39-6 Cooperation between the liver and kidney in excreting nitrogen derived from amino-acid breakdown. In this example, we assume a release of $940 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of amino groups, resulting in the urinary excretion of $450 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of urea ( $900 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of amino nitrogen) and $40 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. The values in the boxes are approximations.
some dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, which then enters the lumen of the late proximal tubule and the early tDLH (see Fig. 39-5D). This $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ probably diffuses across the aquaporin 1 (AQP1) water channel (see Chapter 5) that is present in both the basolateral and apical membranes of these tubules. Luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$then traps the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(see Fig. 39-5B).

Thus, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$recycles between the proximal tubule/tDLH and the TAL.

Second, some of the interstitial $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, which then enters the lumen of the medullary collecting ducts (see Fig. 39-5D). $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ diffuses into the cell across the basolateral membrane via the gas channels RhBG and RhCG, and then enters the lumen via RhCG, where the $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ combines with secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ (see Fig. 39-5E). In addition, the Na-K pump may carry $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(in place of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$) into cells of the medullary collecting ducts. To the extent that $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$moves directly from the TAL to the medullary collecting duct, it engages in a bypass of the cortical portions of the distal nephron. This bypass prevents cortical portions of the distal nephron from losing $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ by diffusion from the lumen into the cortical interstitium, and thus minimizes the entry of the toxic $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ into the circulation.

Third, a small fraction of medullary $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$enters the vasa recta. This $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$washout returns the nitrogen to the systemic circulation for eventual detoxification by the liver. In the steady state, the buildup of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$in the medulla leads to a sharp increase in $\left[\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right]$along the corticomedullary axis.

Because the liver synthesizes glutamine (see p. 965), the main starting material for $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$production in the kidney, hepatorenal interactions are important in the overall process of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion (Fig. 39-6). The liver disposes of $\sim 1000 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of amino groups during the catabolism of amino acids. Some of these amino groups become $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$via deamination reactions, and some end up as amino groups on either glutamate or aspartate via transamination reactions.

Of the $\sim 1000 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day of catabolized amino groups, the liver detoxifies $\sim 95 \%$ by producing urea (see p. 965), which the kidneys excrete (see p. 770). One $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ in urea comes from an $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$that had dissociated to form $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the other $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ comes from aspartate, and the $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ comes from $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 39-6). The net result is the generation of urea and-considering that the generated $\mathrm{H}^{+}$consumes another $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-the consumption of two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

The liver detoxifies the remaining $\sim 5 \%$ of catabolized amino groups by converting $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and glutamate to glutamine (see Fig. 39-6). This reaction does not generate acidbase equivalents. The proximal-tubule cells take up this hepatic glutamine and use it as the source of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$that they secrete into the tubule lumen as they generate one new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 39-5A).

Thus, the two hepatorenal mechanisms for disposing of catabolized amino groups have opposite effects on $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. For each catabolized amino group excreted as urea, the liver consumes the equivalent of one $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. For each catabolized amino group excreted as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$via the glutamine pathway, the proximal tubule produces one new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 39-6). To the extent that the kidney excretes $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, the liver consumes less $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$as it synthesizes urea (Box 39-1). 05-9

# N39-9 Net Renal Ammonium Excretion 

## Contributed by Peter Aronson and Gerhard Giebisch

As noted in the text, one component of the "new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ " created by the proximal tubule parallels the generation of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$in the proximal-tubule lumen. However, this generation of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is reversed to the extent that the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$reabsorbed by the TAL into the medullary interstitium is then picked up by the vasa recta and carried back to the liver for urea production (see Fig. 39-6). Thus, the resecretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ from the medullary interstitium into the collecting-duct lumen (for excretion into the urine) is crucial to optimize the efficiency of new- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$generation by the kidney and thus to balance net acid production.

# BOX 39-1 Renal Tubular Acidosis 

## Contributed by Mark D. Parker

Renal tubular acidosis (RTA) is a broad label applied to a group of disorders that compromise renal acid-base handling. RTA is characterized by a reduced ability to eliminate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the urine or by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$wasting, both of which can result in a lowered plasma pH (i.e., metabolic acidosis) and, in children, severe impairment of physical and intellectual development. RTA can follow a more generalized disruption of renal function (e.g., as a side effect of medication, autoimmune disease, multiple myeloma) or can result from mutations in genes that encode renal acid-base-handling proteins. RTA is classified into four types, each of which has a different set of causes and clinical manifestations. In addition, we can define a fifth type of RTA that is associated with end-stage renal disease.

## Type 1 or Distal RTA

Distal RTA (dRTA) results from defective $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by distal segments of the nephron. Consequently, dRTA patients cannot appropriately acidify their urine and may exhibit a metabolic acidosis. Genetic causes of dRTA include mutations in the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger AE1 and in subunits of the $\mathbf{H}$ pump, both of which are key components of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-secretory machinery in $\alpha$-intercalated cells (see Fig. 39-4D). In patients with incomplete dRTA, blood pH is unaffected because compensatory mechanisms (e.g., proximal-tubule function) remain intact; in these individuals, metabolic acidosis occurs only following an acid load. Manifestations of dRTA can include hypokalemia, kidney stones, hemolytic anemia (due to loss of AE1 function in red cells), and hearing loss (due to loss of H pump function in the cochlea).

## Type 2 or Proximal RTA

Proximal RTA (pRTA) results from the inability of proximal-tubule cells to reabsorb filtered $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or to generate new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Consequently, pRTA patients exhibit a severe metabolic acidosis and a wasting of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the urine. Genetic defects in the $\mathbf{N a} / \mathbf{H C O}_{3}$ cotransporter NBCe1 cause pRTA because of the key role of
that protein in mediating $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$movement into the bloodstream (see Fig. 39-4A). Other causes include Fanconi syndrome (e.g., due to multiple myeloma, lead poisoning) and acetazolamide toxicity. Manifestations of pRTA can include hypokalemia and-in children-developmental defects, including ocular problems and poor dentition (considered in part to be due to loss of NBCe1 function in the eye and enamel organ).

## Type 3 RTA

Type 3 RTA is a rare combination of type 1 and type 2 RTAs and is associated with defects in CA II, a shared component of the acid-base-handling mechanisms in the distal and proximal tubules. Clinical manifestations include osteopetrosis due to loss of CA II function in osteoclasts (see p. 1056).

## Type 4 or Hyperkalemic RTA (Hypoaldosteronism)

Hyperkalemic RTA is a mild form of acidosis caused by aldosterone insufficiency or renal insensitivity to aldosterone. Insufficient stimulation of mineralocorticoid receptors in $\alpha$-intercalated cells reduces $\mathrm{H}^{+}$directly (see p. 835); insufficient stimulation of these receptors in principal cells reduces $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, leading to hyperkalemia, which causes metabolic acidosis by several mechanisms (see p. 835).

## Uremic Acidosis

In end-stage renal disease, a loss of functional renal mass compromises total ammoniagenesis. (5) N39-1

## Treatment

Treatments for RTA vary depending on the clinical signs in each case but generally focus on correcting the metabolic acidosis by administration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or citrate salts (oral base therapy). Additional therapies include administration of diuretics (e.g., hydrochlorothiazide) to stimulate renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

## REGULATION OF RENAL ACID SECRETION

A variety of physiological and pathophysiological stimuli can modulate renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion as well as $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ synthesis. Most of these factors produce coordinated changes in apical and basolateral acid-base transport, as well as in $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ production.

## Respiratory acidosis stimulates renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion

The four fundamental pH disturbances are respiratory acidosis and alkalosis, and metabolic acidosis and alkalosis (see Fig. 28-11A). In each case, the initial and almost instantaneous line of defense is the action of buffers-both in the extracellular and intracellular compartments-to minimize the magnitude of the pH changes (see pp. 628-629). However, restoring the pH to a value as close to "normal" as possible requires slower compensatory responses from the lungs or kidneys.

In respiratory acidosis, in which the primary disturbance is an increase in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, the compensatory response
is an increase in renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, which translates to increased production of new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$via $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion. The opposite occurs in respiratory alkalosis. These changes in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion tend to correct the distorted $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] /$ $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ ratios that occur in primary respiratory acid-base derangements.

Respiratory acidosis stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in at least three ways. First, an acute elevated $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ directly stimulates proximal-tubule cells to secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, as shown by applying solutions in which it is possible to change $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ without altering basolateral pH or $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$. 10 10 Thus, proximaltubule cells directly sense basolateral $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In part, the mechanism is the exocytotic insertion of H pumps into the apical membranes of proximal-tubule cells. Second, acute respiratory acidosis also causes exocytotic insertion of H pumps into the apical membranes of intercalated cells in distal nephron segments. Third, chronic respiratory acidosis leads to adaptive responses that upregulate acid-base transporters. For example, respiratory acidosis increases the activities of apical NHE3 and basolateral NBCe1 in proximal tubule. These adaptive changes allow the kidney to

# N39-10 Use of Out-of-Equilibrium Solutions to Probe the Chemosensitivity of the Proximal Tubule 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

As described in (1) N28-4, the laboratory of Walter Boron developed a rapid-mixing technique that makes it possible to generate out-of-equilibrium (OOE) $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solutions with virtually any combination of $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right],\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}\right]$, and pH-as long as the desired pH is not more than a few pH units from neutrality.

Recently, the laboratory has applied the $\mathrm{OOE} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solutions to learn more about how the proximal tubule senses acute acid-base disturbances and translates that information to alter the rate at which the tubule reabsorbs $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(i.e., moves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from the lumen to the basolateral side of the tubule). The approach was to isolate a single proximal tubule and perfuse its lumen with a solution of $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2} / 22 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{HCO}_{3} / \mathrm{pH} 7.4$ as well as ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}$-methoxyinulin as a volume marker. By collecting the fluid after it had flowed down the lumen and then analyzing this fluid for $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and $\left[{ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\right.$-methoxyinulin], the investigators were able to compute the rate of volume reabsorption ( $J_{\mathrm{V}}$-that is, the rate at which the tubule moves water from the lumen to the basolateral surface of the tubule, measured in nanoliters per minute per millimeter of tubule length) and the rate of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption ( $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$-measured in picomoles per minute per millimeter of tubule length). The investigators superfused the basolateral (bl) surface of the tubule with a rapidly flowing solution that was either the "standard" equilibrated $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2} / 22 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{HCO}_{3} / \mathrm{pH}$ 7.4 solution or an OOE solution in which they varied-one at a time- $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{br}},\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{br}}$, or $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{bl}}$. Thus, they were able to observe the effects of altering basolateral acid-base composition on $J_{V}$ and $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$.

What they found was rather striking. When the investigators raised $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {bl }}$ from 0 to 4.8 mM -at a fixed $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {bl }}$ of 22 mM and a fixed $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {bl }}$ of 7.40 -they found that $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ increased in a graded fashion. This result is what one might expect from what we learned about a metabolic compensation to a respiratory acidosis (see p. 641). That is, the kidney ought to respond to a rise in $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {br }}$-the "respiratory" part of a respiratory acidosisby reabsorbing more $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and thereby tending to restore blood pH to a more alkaline value. However, the investigators were quite surprised to find that increases in $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ were not accompanied by the expected increases in $J_{V}$ (i.e., the extra $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorbed by the proximal tubule should have been accompanied by osmotically obligated water, which should have raised $J_{V}$ appreciably).

When the investigators raised $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {bl }}$ from 0 to 44 mM at a fixed $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {bl }}$ of 1.2 mM and a fixed $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {bl }}$ of 7.40 -they found
that $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ decreased in a graded fashion. This result is what one might expect for the kidney's response to a metabolic alkalosis caused by an abnormality outside of the kidney. That is, the kidney ought to respond to a rise in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {bl }}$-the "metabolic" part of a metabolic alkalosis-by reabsorbing less $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and thereby tending to restore blood pH to a more acidic value. However, the investigators were quite surprised to find that decreases in $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ were not accompanied by the expected decreases in $J_{V}$ (i.e., because the tubule reabsorbed less $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, it should also have reabsorbed less osmotically obligated water, so that $J_{V}$ should have fallen appreciably).

Finally, when the investigators raised $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {bl }}$ from 6.8 to 8.0 mM -at a fixed $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {br }}$ of 1.2 mM and a fixed $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {bl }}$ of 22 mM-they found that $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ did not change! One might have expected that a basolateral alkalosis (the "alkalosis" part of a respiratory or metabolic alkalosis) would have caused the tubule to reabsorb less $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and thereby tend to restore blood pH to a more acidic value. In these experiments, the intracellular pH of the tubule cells changed appreciably, but neither change in pH , intracellular or basolateral, triggered a change in $J_{\mathrm{HCO}_{3}}$ or $J_{\mathrm{V}}$.

These experiments led the investigators to conclude that the proximal tubule cannot sense pH per se. Instead, they propose that the proximal-tubule cell has sensors for both basolateral $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and basolateral $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. In other words, the proximal tubule seems to regulate blood pH by sensing the body's two most important buffers. When activated, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sensors would trigger an increase in $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption but a compensating increase in the reabsorption of other solutes. When activated, the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$sensors would trigger a decrease in $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption but a compensating increase in the reabsorption of other solutes. The compensating effects on the other solutes would serve to stabilize blood pressure.

produce a metabolic compensation to the respiratory acidosis (see p. 641).

## Metabolic acidosis stimulates both proximal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion and $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ production

The first compensatory response to metabolic acidosis is increased alveolar ventilation, which blows off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see p. 710) and thus corrects the distorted $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] /\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ ratio in a primary metabolic acidosis. The kidneys can also participate in the compensatory response-assuming, of course, that the acidosis is not the consequence of renal disease. Proximal-tubule cells can directly sense an acute fall in basolateral $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, which results in a stimulation of proximal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. N39-10 In intercalated cells in the distal nephron, metabolic acidosis stimulates apical membrane H pump insertion and activity. The mechanism may be protonsensitive G protein-coupled receptors on the basolateral membrane of intercalated cells, and an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-sensitive soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC) in the cytosol.

In chronic metabolic acidosis, the adaptive responses of the proximal tubule are probably similar to those outlined above for chronic respiratory acidosis. These include upregulation of apical NHE3 and electrogenic H pumps, as well as basolateral NBCe1 (Fig. 39-7), perhaps reflecting increases in the number of transporters on the surface membranes. The parallel activation of apical and basolateral transporters may minimize changes in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ while increasing transepithelial $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption. This upregulation appears to involve intracellular protein kinases, including the Src family of receptor-associated tyrosine kinases (see p. 70). Endothelin appears to be essential for the upregulation of NHE3 in chronic metabolic acidosis.

In addition to increased $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, the other ingredient needed to produce new $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is enhanced $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ production. Together, the two increase $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion. Indeed, the excretion of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$into the urine increases markedly as a result of the adaptive response to chronic metabolic acidosis

(Fig. 39-8). Thus, the ability to increase $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ synthesis is an important element in the kidney's defense against acidotic challenges. Indeed, as chronic metabolic acidosis develops, the kidneys progressively excrete a larger fraction of urinary $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. As a consequence, the excretion of titratable acid becomes a progressively smaller fraction of total acid excretion.

The adaptive stimulation of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ synthesis, which occurs in response to a fall in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ involves a stimulation of both glutaminase and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). The stimulation of mitochondrial glutaminase increases the conversion of glutamine to $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$and glutamate (see Fig. 39-5A). The stimulation of PEPCK enhances gluconeogenesis and thus the conversion of $\alpha$-KG (the product of glutamate deamination) to glucose.

## Metabolic alkalosis reduces proximal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion and, in the CCT, may even provoke $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion

Figure 39-9A illustrates the response of the proximal tubule to metabolic alkalosis. As shown in the upper curve, when the peritubular capillaries have a physiological $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, increasing the luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$causes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion to increase steeply up to a luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of -45 mM . The reason is that the incremental luminal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is an additional buffer that minimizes the luminal acidification in the vicinity of the apical $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transporters.

As shown in the lower curve in Figure 39-9A, when $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$in the peritubular blood is higher than normalthat is, during metabolic alkalosis- $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion is lower for any luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$. The likely explanation is that the proximal-tubule cell directly senses the increase in plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, depressing the rates at which NHE3 moves $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from cell to lumen and NBCe1 moves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from cell to blood.

B CORTICAL COLLECTING TUBULE (CCT): $\beta$ INTERCALATED CELL
![bo14221257579](bo14221257579.jpg)

Figure 39-9 Effect of chronic metabolic alkalosis on renal acid-base transport. (Data from Alpern RJ, Cogan MG, Rector FC: Effects of extracellular fluid volume and plasma bicarbonate concentration on proximal acidification in the rat. J Clin Invest 71:736-746, 1983.)

So far, we have discussed the effect of metabolic alkalosis on $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by the proximal tubule. In the ICT and CCT, metabolic alkalosis can cause the tubule to switch from secreting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the lumen. The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-intercalated cells in the ICT and CCT secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by using an apical H pump and a basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger, which is AE1 (SLC4A1; see Fig. 39-4D). Metabolic alkalosis, over a period of days, shifts the intercalated-cell population, increasing the proportion of $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-intercalated cells (see Fig. 39-9B) $\bigcirc$ N39-5 at the expense of $\alpha$ cells. Because $\beta$ cells have the opposite apical-versus-basolateral distribution of H pumps and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers, they secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the lumen and tend to correct the metabolic alkalosis. The apical $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger in $\beta$ cells is pendrin (SLC26A4; see Table 5-4).

In contrast to chronic alkalosis, chronic acidosis alters the distribution of intercalated cell types in the distal nephron in favor of acid-secreting $\alpha$ cells (see Fig. 39-4D) over the base-secreting $\beta$-intercalated cells.

## A rise in GFR increases $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$delivery to the tubules, enhancing $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption (glomerulotubular balance for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$)

Increasing either luminal flow or luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$significantly enhances $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption, (○) N39-11 probably by raising effective $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$(and thus pH$)$ in the microenvironment of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transporters in the brush-border microvilli. Because a high luminal pH stimulates NHE3 and the H pumps located in the microvilli of the proximal tubule, increased flow translates to enhanced $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. This flow dependence, an example of glomerulotubular (GT) balance (see p. 763), is important because it minimizes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$loss, and thus the development of a metabolic acidosis, when GFR increases. Conversely, this GT balance of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption also prevents metabolic alkalosis when GFR decreases. The flow dependence of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption also accounts for the stimulation of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transport that occurs after uninephrectomy (i.e., surgical removal of one kidney), when GFR in the remnant kidney rises in response to the loss of renal tissue.

## Extracellular volume contraction-via ANG II, aldosterone, and sympathetic activity—stimulates renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion

A decrease in effective circulating volume stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption by four parallel pathways (see pp. 838-840), including activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (and thus an increase in ANG II levels) and stimulation of renal sympathetic nerves (and thus the release of norepinephrine). Both ANG II and norepinephrine stimulate $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange in the proximal tubule. Because the proximal tubule couples $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$transport, volume contraction increases not only $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption but also $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. Similarly, ANG II stimulates acid secretion by $\alpha$-intercalated cells in the distal nephron. Volume expansion has the opposite effect. On a longer time scale, volume depletion also increases aldosterone levels, thereby enhancing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in cortical and medullary collecting ducts (see below). Thus, the regulation of effective circulating volume takes precedence over the regulation of plasma pH . (○) N39-12

## Hypokalemia increases renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion

As discussed on page 803, acid-base disturbances can cause changes in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$homeostasis. The opposite is also true. Because a side effect of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion is increased renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion is frequently associated with metabolic alkalosis. Several lines of evidence indicate that, in the proximal tubule, hypokalemia leads to a marked increase in apical $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport. As in other cells, in tubule cells the pH falls during $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion (see p. 645). The resulting chronic cell acidification may lead to adaptive responses that activate $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange and electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport, presumably by the same mechanisms that stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in chronic acidosis (see Fig. 39-7). In the proximal tubule, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion also markedly increases $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ synthesis and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion, thus increasing urinary $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion as $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$. Finally, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion stimulates apical $\mathrm{K}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange in $\alpha$-intercalated cells

## N39-11 Flow Dependence of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Reabsorption

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

In the text, we point out that raising either luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or luminal flow increases $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption. One likely mechanism is mentioned in the text: The higher the flow or the higher the bulk luminal $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, the higher the pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ in the unstirred layer that surrounds the microvilli on the apical membrane. In addition, increasing the flow also increases the shear force that acts on the central cilium present on every proximal-tubule cell. It is believed that the more the cilium bends with flow, the greater the signal to increase the reabsorption of solutes (including $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ) and water. This hypothesis would account for at least a portion of the glomerulotubular balance for both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption (see p. 834) and fractional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (see p. 763).

## N39-12 Effect of Dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Intake on Proximal-Tubule NHE3 Activity

Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager
Decreased dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake causes a decrease in effective circulating volume (i.e., volume contraction), resulting in increased activity of the apical NHE3. This effect is evident even if one assesses the activity in brush-border membrane vesicles removed from the animal. Consumption of a high- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ diet has the opposite effect.

of the ICT and CCT (see p. 799) and enhances $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion as a side effect of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$retention.

Just as hypokalemia can maintain metabolic alkalosis, hyperkalemia is often associated with metabolic acidosis. A contributory factor may be reduced $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion, perhaps because of lower synthesis in proximal-tubule cells, possibly due to a higher intracellular pH . In addition, with high luminal $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the TAL, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$competes with $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$for uptake by apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporters and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, thereby reducing $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$reabsorption. As a result, the reduced $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$ levels in the medullary interstitium provide less $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ for diffusion into the medullary collecting duct. Finally, with high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the medullary interstitium, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$competes with $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$for uptake by basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps in the medullary collecting duct. The net effects are reduced $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$excretion and acidosis.

## Both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids stimulate acid secretion

Chronic adrenal insufficiency (see p. 1019) leads to acid retention and, potentially, to life-threatening metabolic acidosis. Both glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, but at different sites along the nephron.

Glucocorticoids (e.g., cortisol) enhance the activity of $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange in the proximal tubule and thus stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion. In addition, they inhibit phosphate reabsorption, raising the luminal availability of buffer anions for titration by secreted $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

Mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion by three coordinated mechanisms-one direct and two indirect. First, mineralocorticoids directly stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in the collecting tubules and ducts by increasing the activity of the apical electrogenic H pump and basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see Fig. 39-4D). Second, mineralocorticoids indirectly stimulate $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the collecting ducts (see p. 766), which increases the lumen-negative voltage. This increased negativity may stimulate the apical electrogenic H pump in $\alpha$-intercalated cells to secrete acid. Third, mineralocorticoids-particularly when administered for longer periods of time and accompanied by high $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ intake-cause $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion and indirectly increase $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion (see pp. 834-835).

## Diuretics can change $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, depending on how they affect transepithelial voltage, ECF volume, and plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$

The effects of diuretics on renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion (1) N39-13 vary substantially from one diuretic to another, depending on both the site and the mechanism of action. From the point of view of acid-base balance, diuretics fall broadly into two groups: those that promote the excretion of a relatively alkaline urine and those that have the opposite effect.

To the first group belong CA inhibitors and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics. The CA inhibitors lead to excretion of an alkaline urine by inhibiting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. Their greatest effect is in the proximal tubule, but they also inhibit $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by the TAL and intercalated cells in the distal nephron. $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing diuretics-including amiloride, triamterene, and the spironolactones-also reduce acid excretion. Both amiloride and triamterene inhibit the apical epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels (ENaCs; see pp. 758-759) in the collecting tubules and ducts, rendering the lumen more positive so that it is more difficult for the electrogenic H pump to secrete $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions into the lumen. Spironolactones decrease $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion by interfering with the action of aldosterone.

The second group of diuretics-those that tend to increase urinary acid excretion and often induce alkalosis-includes loop diuretics such as furosemide (which inhibits the apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter in the TAL) and thiazide diuretics such as chlorothiazide (which inhibits the apical $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter in the DCT). These diuretics act by three mechanisms. First, all cause some degree of volume contraction, and thus lead to increased levels of ANG II and aldosterone (see pp. 841-842), both of which enhance $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion. Second, these diuretics enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to the collecting tubules and ducts, thereby increasing the electrogenic uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, raising lumen-negative voltage, and enhancing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion. Third, this group of diuretics causes $K^{+}$wasting; as discussed on pages $834-835, \mathrm{~K}^{+}$depletion enhances $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion.

# CHAPTER 40 

## INTEGRATION OF SALT AND WATER BALANCE

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

Two separate but closely interrelated control systems regulate the volume and osmolality of the extracellular fluid (ECF). It is important to regulate the ECF volume to maintain blood pressure, which is essential for adequate tissue perfusion and function. The body regulates ECF volume by adjusting the total-body content of NaCl . It is important to regulate the extracellular osmolality because hypotonic (see pp. 131-132) or hypertonic (see p. 131) osmolalities cause changes in cell volume that seriously compromise cell function, especially in the central nervous system (CNS). The body regulates extracellular osmolality by adjusting totalbody water content. These two homeostatic mechanismsfor ECF volume and osmolality-use different sensors, different hormonal transducers, and different effectors (Table 40-1). However, they have one thing in common: some of their effectors, although different, are located in the kidney. In the case of the ECF volume, the control system modulates the urinary excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In the case of osmolality, the control system modulates the urinary excretion of solutefree water or simply free water (see pp. 806-807).

Sodium Balance The maintenance of the ECF volume, or $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance, depends on signals that reflect the adequacy of the circulation-the so-called effective circulating volume, discussed below. Low- and high-pressure baroreceptors send afferent signals to the brain (see pp. 536-537), which translates this "volume signal" into several responses that can affect ECF volume or blood pressure over either the short or the long term. The short-term effects (over a period of seconds to minutes) occur as the autonomic nervous system and humoral mechanisms modulate the activity of the heart and blood vessels to control blood pressure. The long-term effects (over a period of hours to days) consist of nervous, humoral, and hemodynamic mechanisms that modulate renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (see pp. 763-769). In the first part of this chapter, we discuss the entire feedback loop, of which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ excretion is the effector.

Why is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content of the body the main determinant of the ECF volume? $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, with its associated anions, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, is the main osmotic constituent of the ECF volume; when Na salts move, water must follow. Because the body generally maintains ECF osmolality within narrow limits (e.g., $\sim 290$ milliosmoles $/ \mathrm{kg}$, or 290 mOsm ), it follows that whole-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content-which the kidneys control-must be the major determinant of the ECF volume. A simple example illustrates the point. If the kidney were to enhance
the excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and its accompanying anions by 145 milliequivalents (meq) each-the amount of solute normally present in 1 L of ECF-the kidneys would have to excrete an additional liter of urine to prevent a serious fall in osmolality. Alternatively, the addition of 145 mmol of "dry" NaCl to the ECF obligates the addition of 1 L of water to the ECF; this addition can be accomplished by ingestion of water or reduction of renal excretion of free water. Relatively small changes in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion lead to marked alterations in the ECF volume. Thus, precise and sensitive control mechanisms are needed to safeguard and regulate the body's content of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

Water Balance The maintenance of osmolality, or water balance, depends on receptors in the hypothalamus that detect changes in the plasma osmolality. These receptors send signals to areas of the brain that (1) control thirst and thus regulate free-water intake and (2) control the production of arginine vasopressin (AVP)-also known as antidiuretic hormone (ADH)-and thus regulate free-water excretion by the kidneys. We discuss renal water excretion beginning on page 806. In the second part of this chapter, we discuss the entire feedback loop, of which water excretion is merely the end point.

Why is the water content of the body the main determinant of osmolality? Total-body osmolality is defined as the ratio of total-body osmoles to total-body water (see p. 102). Although the ECF volume control system can regulate the amount of extracellular osmoles, it has little effect on totalbody osmoles. Total-body osmoles are largely a function of the intracellular milieu because the intracellular compartment is larger than the ECF and its solute composition is highly regulated. Total-body osmoles do not change substantially except during growth or during certain disease states, such as diabetes mellitus (in which excess glucose increases total-body osmolality). Only by controlling water independent of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$control can the body control osmolality.

## CONTROL OF EXTRACELLULAR FLUID VOLUME

In the steady state, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake via the gastrointestinal tract equals $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ output from renal and extrarenal pathways
The two principal solutes in the ECF are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Sodium is one of the most abundant ions in the body, totaling

$\sim 58 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight. Approximately $65 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is located in the ECF, and an additional $5 \%$ to $10 \%$, in the intracellular fluid (ICF). Extracellular and intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, comprising $70 \%$ to $75 \%$ of the total-body pool, is readily exchangeable, as determined by its ability to equilibrate rapidly with injected radioactive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The remaining $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ of the body's $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$pool is bound as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-apatites in bone. The concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the plasma and interstitial fluid typically ranges between 135 and 145 mM .

Chloride totals $\sim 33 \mathrm{meq} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight. Approximately $85 \%$ is extracellular, and the remaining $15 \%$ is intracellular. Thus, all $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is readily exchangeable. The $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$of plasma and interstitial fluid normally varies between 100 and 108 mM . Changes in total-body $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are usually influenced by the same factors, and in the same direction, as changes in total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Exceptions arise during acid-base disturbances, when $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$metabolism may change independently of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

By definition, in the steady state, the total-body content of water and electrolytes is constant. For $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, this concept can be expressed as

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Oral } \mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {intake }= & \text { Renal } \mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {output }+ \\
& \text { Extrarenal } \mathrm{Na}^{+} \text {output }
\end{aligned}
$$

Under normal circumstances, extrarenal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$output is negligible. However, large fluid losses from the gastrointestinal tract (e.g., vomiting, diarrhea) or skin (e.g., excessive sweating, extensive burns) can represent substantial extrarenal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$losses. The kidney responds to such deficits by reducing renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. Conversely, in conditions of excessive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake, the kidneys excrete the surfeit of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

## The kidneys increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion in response to an increase in ECF volume, not to an increase in extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration

In contrast to many other renal mechanisms of electrolyte excretion, the renal excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$depends on the amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in the body and not on the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration in ECF. Because the amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is the product of ECF volume and the extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration, and because the osmoregulatory system keeps plasma osmolality constant within very narrow limits, it is actually the volume of ECF that acts as the signal for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$homeostasis.

Figure 40-1A demonstrates the renal response to an abrupt step increase and step decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake. A subject weighing 70 kg starts with an unusually low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
intake of $10 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, matched by an equally low urinary output. When the individual abruptly increases dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ intake from 10 to $150 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day-and maintains it at this level for several days-urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$output also increases, but at first it lags behind intake. This initial period during which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake exceeds $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$output is a state of positive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ balance. After $\sim 5$ days, urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$output rises to match dietary intake, after which total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$does not increase further. In this example, we assume that the cumulative retention of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$amounts to 140 mmol .

The abrupt increase in dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$initially elevates plasma osmolality, thus stimulating thirst and release of AVP. Because the subject has free access to water, and because the kidneys salvage water in response to AVP (see pp. 817-819), the volume of free water rises. This increase in free water not only prevents a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$and osmolality, but also produces a weight gain that, in this example, is 1 kg (see Fig. 40-1A). This weight gain corresponds, in our example, to the accumulation of 140 mmol of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and the accompanying free water, which makes 1 L of isotonic saline. In the new steady state, only the extracellular compartment has increased in volume. Intracellular volume does not change because, in the end, no driving force exists for water to cross cell membranes (i.e., extracellular osmolality is normal). Instead, the slight expansion of ECF volume signals the kidney to increase its rate of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. The extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration is unchanged during this period and thus cannot be the signal to increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion.

When the subject in our example later reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake to the initial level of $10 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day (see Fig. 40-1A), $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ excretion diminishes until the initial balanced state (input $=$ output) is established once again. Immediately after the reduction in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is temporarily out of balance. This time, we have a period of negative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance, in which output exceeds input. During this period, the ECF volume falls by 1 L , and body weight returns to normal. Again, the extracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration is unchanged during this transient period.

Ingestion of increasingly larger amounts of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$results in retention of progressively larger amounts in the steady state and thus accumulation of progressively more ECF volume. Urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion increases linearly with this rise in retained $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, as shown in Figure 40-1B. The control system that so tightly links urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion to ECF volume is extremely sensitive. In our hypothetical example (see Fig. $40-1 A$ )-a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ individual with an initial ECF volume of 17 L -expanding ECF volume by 1 L , or $\sim 6 \%$, triggers a

The gold area between the two curves at the beginning of the experiment corresponds to the accumulated total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$of 140 mmol . This additional $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, dissolved in $\sim 1 \mathrm{~L}$ of ECF, accounts for the 1-kg gain in body weight (blue curve). (B, Data from Walser M: Phenomenological analysis of renal regulation of sodium and potassium balance. Kidney Int 27:837-841, 1985.)

15-fold increase in steady-state urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (i.e., from $10 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day to $150 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day in Fig. 40-1A). Physiologically normal individuals can be in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance on a nearly $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-free diet ( 1 to $2 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day) without overt signs of ECF volume depletion. Conversely, even with consumption of a high- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diet ( $200 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day versus the "normal" $\sim 100 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day for a Western diet), clinical signs of ECF volume excess, such as edema, are absent.

## It is not the ECF volume as a whole, but the effective circulating volume, that regulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion

Although we have referred to the overall expansion of the ECF volume as the signal for increased urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion, this is an oversimplification. Only certain regions of the ECF compartment are important for this signaling. For an expansion in ECF volume to stimulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion-either acutely or chronically-the expansion must make itself evident in parts of the ECF compartment where the ECF volume sensors are located, namely, in blood-filled compartments. ECF volume per se is not the critical factor in regulating renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion.

The critical parameter that the body recognizes is the effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555)—not something that we can identify anatomically. Rather, effective circulating volume is a functional blood volume that reflects the extent of tissue perfusion in specific regions, as evidenced by the fullness or pressure within their blood vessels. Normally, changes in effective circulating volume parallel those in total ECF volume. However, this relationship may be distorted in certain diseases, such as congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, or liver cirrhosis. In all three cases, total ECF volume is grossly expanded (e.g., edema or ascites). In contrast, the effective circulating volume is low, resulting
in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention. For example, in congestive heart failure, particularly when edema is extensive, the total ECF volume is greatly increased. However, the low cardiac output fails to expand the key blood-filled compartments. As a result, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by the renal tubules remains high (i.e., urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion is inappropriately low compared with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake), which exacerbates the systemic congestion (Box 40-1). N40-1

## Decreases in effective circulating volume trigger four parallel effector pathways to decrease renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion

Figure 40-2 shows the elements of the feedback loop that controls the effective circulating volume. As summarized in Table 40-2, sensors that monitor changes in effective circulating volume are baroreceptors located in both highpressure (see pp. 534-536) and low-pressure (see pp. 546547) areas of the circulation. Although most are located within the vascular tree of the thorax, additional baroreceptors are present in the kidney-particularly in the afferent arterioles (see p. 730)-as well as in the CNS and liver. Of the pressures at these sites, it is renal perfusion pressure that is most important for long-term regulation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion, and thus blood pressure, because increased resistance to renal blood flow (e.g., renal artery stenosis) causes sustained hypertension (Box 40-2). The sensors shown in Figure 40-2 generate four distinct hormonal or neural signals (pathways 1 to 4 in the figure).

In the first pathway, the kidney itself senses a reduced effective circulating volume and directly stimulates a hormonal effector pathway, the renin-angiotensinaldosterone system, discussed in the section beginning on page 841. In addition, increased renal perfusion pressure

# N40-1 Effect of Posture and Water Immersion on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Excretion 

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

On page 838, we introduce congestive heart failure as an example of the nonparallel behavior of ECF volume on the one hand and effective circulating volume on the other. Two additional examples that depend upon gravity are posture and water immersion.

Urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion is lowest when one is standing (i.e., when thoracic perfusion is lowest), higher when one is lying down (recumbency), and highest when one is immersed up to the chin for several hours in warm water. During immersion, the hydrostatic pressure of the water compresses the tissues-and thus the vessels, particularly the veins-in the extremities and abdomen and consequently enhances venous return to the thorax. Recumbency-and, to a greater extent, water immersion-shifts blood into the thoracic vessels, increasing the so-called central blood volume (see p. 449). In contrast, the upright position depletes the intrathoracic blood volume. The thoracic vessels are immune to this compression because their extravascular pressure (i.e., intrapleural pressure; see p. 606) is unaffected by the water. Thus, it is the enhanced venous return alone that stimulates vascular sensors to increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. This example clearly demonstrates that only special portions within the ECF compartment play critical roles in the sensing of ECF volume.

## BOX 40-1 Volume Expansion and Contraction

When $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake persists in the face of impaired renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (e.g., during renal failure), the body retains isosmotic fluid. The result is an expansion of plasma volume and of the interstitial fluid compartment. In the extreme, the interstitial volume increase can become so severe that the subepidermal tissues swell (e.g., around the ankles). When the physician presses with a finger against the skin and then removes the finger, the finger imprint remains in the tissue-pitting edema. Not all cases of lower-extremity edema reflect total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid retention. For example, venous obstruction to return of blood from the lower extremities can cause local edema in the lower legs. Patients with this condition should elevate their feet whenever possible and should wear compression stockings.

Fluid can also accumulate in certain transcellular spaces (see p. 102), such as the pleural cavity (pleural effusion) or the peritoneal cavity (ascites); such conditions reflect derangements of local Starling forces or an increase in protein permeability due to inflammation, which alters the fluid distribution between the plasma and the ECF (see Box 20-1). In cases of abnormal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention, putting the subject on a low- $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$diet can partially correct the edema. Administration of diuretics (1) N40-2 can also reduce volume overload, as long as the kidney retains sufficient function to respond to them.

An excessive loss of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the urine can be caused by disturbances of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption along the nephron and leads to a dramatic shrinkage of the ECF volume. Because the plasma volume is part of the ECF volume, significant reductions can severely affect the circulation, culminating in hypovolemic shock (see p. 583). Renal causes of reduced ECF volume include the prolonged use of powerful loop diuretics (see p. 757), osmotic diuresis (see Box 35-1) during poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, adrenal insufficiency with low aldosterone levels, and the recovery phase following acute renal failure or relief of urinary obstruction.

itself can increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion independent of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, as we shall see beginning on page 843 .

The second and third effector pathways are neural. Baroreceptors detect decreases in effective circulating volume and communicate these via afferent neurons to the medulla of the brainstem. Emerging from the medulla are two types of efferent signals that ultimately act on the kidney. In one, increased activity of the sympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system reduces renal blood flow and directly

## BOX 40-2 Renal Hypertension

In the 1930s, Goldblatt produced hypertension experimentally in unilaterally nephrectomized animals by placing a surgical clip around the renal artery of the remaining kidney (one-kidney Goldblatt hypertension). The constriction can be adjusted so that it results not in renal ischemia, but only in a reduction of the perfusion pressure distal to the clip. This maneuver stimulates the renal baroreceptors, leading to a rapid increase in synthesis and secretion of renin from the clipped kidney. The renin release reaches a peak after 1 hour. As renin cleaves ANG I from angiotensinogen, systemic ANG I levels rise quickly. ACE, present mainly in the lungs but also in the kidneys, then rapidly converts ANG I into ANG II. Thus, within minutes of clamping the renal artery, one observes a sustained rise in systemic arterial pressure. The newly established stable elevation in systemic pressure then normalizes the pressure in the renal artery downstream from the constriction. From this time onward, circulating renin and ANG II levels decline toward normal over 5 to 7 days, while the systemic arterial pressure remains abnormally high. The early rise in blood pressure is the result of the renin-angiotensin vasoconstrictor mechanism, which is activated by the experimentally induced reduction in pressure and flow in the renal artery distal to the constriction. The later phase of systemic hypertension is the result of aldosterone release and of the retention of salt and water.

Unilateral partial clamping of a renal artery in an otherwise healthy animal also produces hypertension (two-kidney Goldblatt hypertension). As in the one-kidney model, the clipped kidney increases its synthesis and secretion of renin. Renin then causes ANG II levels to increase systemically and will, in addition to the effect on the clamped kidney, cause the nonclamped contralateral kidney to retain salt and water. As in the one-kidney model, the resulting hypertension has an early vasoconstrictive phase and a delayed volume-dependent phase. These models of hypertension show that the kidney can be critical as a long-term baroreceptor. Thus, when increased resistance in a renal artery leads to reduced intrarenal perfusion pressure, the rest of the body, including central baroreceptors, experiences-and cannot counteract-the sustained hypertension.

In both types of Goldblatt hypertension, administration of ACE inhibitors can lower arterial blood pressure. In fact, inhibiting ACE is therapeutically effective even after circulating renin and ANG II levels have normalized. The reason is that maintained hypertension involves an increased intrarenal conversion of ANG I to ANG II (via renal ACE), with the ANG II enhancing proximal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. Indeed, direct measurements show that, even after circulating renin and ANG II levels have returned to normal, the intrarenal levels of ACE and ANG II are elevated. ACE inhibitors lower systemic and intrarenal ANG II levels.

These experimental models correspond to some forms of human hypertension, including hypertension produced by renin-secreting tumors of the JGA and by all types of pathological impairment of renal arterial blood supply. Thus, coarctation of the aorta, in which the aorta is constricted above the renal arteries but below the arteries to the head and upper extremities, invariably leads to hypertension. Renal hypertension also results from stenosis of a renal artery, caused, for example, by arteriosclerotic thickening of the vessel wall.

# N40-2 Sensitivity of the Natriuretic Response to Increased Extracellular Fluid Volume 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Figure 40-1B shows a hypothetical example of how urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion ( $y$-axis) changes in response to increases in isotonic extracellular water volume (upper $x$-axis) or amount of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retained by the body (lower $x$-axis). In the example in the figure, the urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion increases by $120 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day for every 100 mmol of cumulative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention. This proportionality is indicated by the slope of the line. However, this slope need not be the same for every person.

In a patient with abnormal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention, the natriuretic response must be less sensitive than normal (i.e., the slope of the line in Fig. 40-1B must be less steep). In other words, in response to an increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake, the patient would have to accumulate more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water (i.e., he or she would have to become more volume expanded than would a normal person) in order to sufficiently stimulate the kidneys to elicit the natriuretic response necessary for coming into $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance (i.e., achieving a steady state in which urinary excretion balances dietary intake).

Figure 40-2 Feedback control of effective circulating volume. A low effective circulating volume triggers four parallel effector pathways (numbered 1 to 4) that act on the kidney, either by changing the hemodynamics or by changing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport by the renal-tubule cells. ANS, autonomic nervous system.
stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, thereby reducing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (discussed on pp. 842-843). In the other effector pathway, the posterior pituitary increases its secretion of AVP, which leads to conservation of water (discussed on p. 843). This AVP mechanism becomes active only after large declines in effective circulating volume.

The final pathway is hormonal. Reduced effective circulating volume decreases the release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), thus reducing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (discussed on p. 843).

All four parallel effector pathways correct the primary change in effective circulating blood volume. An increase in effective circulating volume promotes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (thus
reducing ECF volume), whereas a decrease in effective circulating volume inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (thus raising ECF volume).

An important feature of renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion is the two-way redundancy of control mechanisms. First, efferent pathways may act in concert on a single effector within the kidney. For instance, both sympathetic input and hemodynamic/ physical factors often act on proximal tubules. Second, one efferent pathway may act at different effector sites. For example, angiotensin II (ANG II) enhances $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention directly by stimulating apical $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange in tubule cells (see Fig. 35-4) and indirectly by lowering renal plasma flow (see p. 746).

![bo14521257579](bo14521257579.jpg)

Figure 40-3 Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis.

## Increased activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is the first of four parallel pathways that correct a low effective circulating volume

The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (Fig. 40-3) promotes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention via the actions of both ANG II and aldosterone. For a consideration of this axis in the context of the physiology of the adrenal cortex, see page 1029.

Angiotensinogen, (5) N23-12 also known as renin substrate, is an $\alpha_{2}$-globulin that is synthesized by the liver and released into the systemic circulation. The liver contains only small stores of angiotensinogen. Another protein, renin, (5) N40-4 is produced and stored in distinctive granules by the granular cells of the renal juxtaglomerular apparatus (JGA; see p. 727). As discussed below (see p. 841), decreases in effective circulating volume stimulate these cells to release renin, which is a protease that cleaves a peptide bond near the C terminus of angiotensinogen, releasing the decapeptide angiotensin I (ANGI). Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) rapidly removes the two C-terminal amino acids from the physiologically inactive ANG I to form the physiologically active octapeptide ANG II. ACE is present on the luminal surface of vascular endothelia throughout the body and is abundantly present in the endothelium-rich lungs. ACE in the kidney-particularly in the endothelial cells of the afferent and efferent arterioles, and also in the proximal tubule-can produce enough ANG II to exert local vascular effects. Thus, the kidney receives ANG II from three sources: (1) Systemic ANG II comes from the general circulation, originating largely from the pulmonary circulation. (2) Renal vessels generate ANG II from ANG I. (3) Proximaltubule cells, which contain renin and ACE, secrete ANG II into its lumen. Both in the circulation and in the tubule
lumen, aminopeptidases further cleave ANG II to the heptapeptides ANG III [ANG-(2-8)] and ANG-(1-7), which are biologically active.
The principal factor controlling plasma ANG II levels is renin release from JGA granular cells. A decrease in effective circulating volume manifests itself to the JGA-and thus stimulates renin release-in three ways (see Fig. 40-2):

1. Decreased systemic blood pressure (sympathetic effect on JGA). A low effective circulating volume, sensed by baroreceptors located in the central arterial circulation (see p. 534), signals medullary control centers to increase sympathetic outflow to the JGA, which in turn increases renin release. Renal denervation or $\beta$-adrenergic blocking drugs (e.g., propranolol) inhibit renin release.
2. Decreased NaCl concentration at the macula densa ( NaCl sensor). Decreased effective circulating volume tends to increase filtration fraction (the inverse of the sequence shown in Fig. 34-10), thereby increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and fluid reabsorption by the proximal tubule (see p. 842) and reducing the flow of tubule fluid through the loop of Henle. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the thick ascending limb (TAL) then decreases luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$more than if tubular flow were higher. The resulting decrease in luminal $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ at the macula densa stimulates renin release.
3. Decreased renal perfusion pressure (renal baroreceptor). Stretch receptors in the granular cells (see p. 727) of the afferent arterioles sense the decreased distention associated with low effective circulating volume. This decreased stretch lowers $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$, which increases renin release and initiates a cascade that tends to promote $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption and thus increase blood pressure. Conversely, increased distention (high extracellular volume) inhibits renin release.

# N40-4 Renin Release from Granular Cells 

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As pointed out in the text, the granular cells are one of two cell types in which the exocytosis of a hormone decreases in response to a rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. For example, if one raises $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{n}$, the granular cell depolarizes. This depolarization probably opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see p. 190) or decreases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ extrusion via an Na-Ca exchanger (see pp. 123-124). In either case, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ rises and blocks renin release. Similarly, applying $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophores-compounds that increase the permeability of the cell membrane to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-also raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ and reduces renin release.

Increases in intracellular levels of cAMP have the opposite effect of raising $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$-increases in [cAMP], stimulate renin release from granular cells. Conversely, agents that inhibit adenylyl cyclase activity (e.g., $\beta$-adrenergic antagonists, $\alpha$-adrenergic agonists, and $A_{1}$ adenosine receptor agonists) decrease [cAMP], and thereby inhibit renin release.

Figure 40-4 Hemodynamic actions of ANG II on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption.

The above stimulation of renin release by a decrease in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right], \quad$ N40-4 stands in contrast to most $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated secretory processes, in which an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ stimulates secretion (see p. 221). Another exception is the chief cell of the parathyroid gland, in which an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ inhibits secretion of parathyroid hormone (see pp. 1060-1061).

Intracellular cAMP also appears to be a second messenger for renin release. Agents that activate adenylyl cyclase (1) N40-5 enhance renin secretion, presumably via protein kinase A. The question whether the effects of [cAMP] and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ are independent or sequential remains open. (2) N40-3

Additional factors also modulate renin release. Prostaglandins $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{I}_{2}$ and endothelin all activate renin release. Agents that blunt renin release include ANG II (which represents a short feedback loop), AVP, thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, high plasma levels of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and nitric oxide.

ANG II has several important actions as follows:

1. Stimulation of aldosterone release from glomerulosa cells in the adrenal cortex (see p. 1028). In turn, aldosterone promotes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the distal tubule and collecting tubules and ducts (see p. 766).
2. Vasoconstriction of renal and other systemic vessels. ANG II increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by altering renal hemodynamics, probably in two ways (Fig. 40-4). First, at high concentrations, ANG II constricts the efferent more than the afferent arterioles, thus increasing filtration fraction and reducing the hydrostatic pressure in the downstream peritubular capillaries. The increased filtration fraction also increases the protein concentration in the downstream blood and hence raises the colloid osmotic pressure of the peritubular capillaries. The changes in each of these two Starling forces favor the uptake of reabsorbate from peritubular interstitium into peritubular capillaries (see pp. 763-765) and hence enhance the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid by the proximal tubule. Second, ANG II decreases medullary blood flow through the vasa recta. Low blood flow decreases the medullary washout of NaCl and urea (see pp. 813-815), thus raising [urea] in the medullary interstitium and enhancing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption along the thin ascending limb of Henle's loop (see p. 811).
3. Enhanced tubuloglomerular feedback. ANG II raises the sensitivity and lowers the set-point of the tubuloglo-
merular feedback mechanism (see pp. 750-751), so that an increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid delivery to the macula densa elicits a more pronounced fall in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
4. Enhanced Na-H exchange. ANG II promotes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the proximal tubule, TAL, and initial collecting tubule (see pp. 765-766).
5. Renal hypertrophy. Over a prolonged time, ANG II induces hypertrophy of renal-tubule cells.
6. Stimulated thirst and AVP release. ANG II acts on the hypothalamus, where it increases the sensation of thirst and stimulates secretion of AVP from the posterior pituitary, both of which increase total-body free water. This ANG II effect represents an intersection between the systems for regulating effective circulating volume and osmolality.

## Increased sympathetic nerve activity, increased AVP, and decreased ANP are the other three parallel pathways that correct a low effective circulating volume

Renal Sympathetic Nerve Activity The second of the four parallel effector pathways for the control of effective circulating volume is the sympathetic nervous system. Enhanced activity of the renal sympathetic nerves has two direct effects on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (see pp. 766-768): (1) increased renal vascular resistance, and (2) increased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption by tubule cells. In addition, increased sympathetic tone has an indirect effect-enhancing renin release from granular cells (see previous section). These multiple actions of sympathetic traffic to the kidney reduce GFR and enhance $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, thereby increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention and increasing effective circulating volume.

In everyday life (i.e., the unstressed state), the role of sympathetic nerve activity in kidney function appears to be modest at best. However, sympathetic innervation may play a role during challenges to volume homeostasis. For example, low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake triggers reduced renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion; renal denervation blunts this response. Another example is hemorrhage, in which renal sympathetic nerves emerge as important participants in preserving ECF volume.

# N40-3 Systemic versus Local Roles of the Juxtaglomerular Apparatus 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The JGA performs two apparently opposite functions: maintaining a constant GFR (tubuloglomerular feedback, or TGF) and maintaining a constant whole-body blood pressure by modulating renin release. TGF (see pp. 750-751) is a local phenomenon, whereas the release of renin has systemic consequences (see pp. 841-842).

In the case of tubuloglomerular feedback (i.e., the local response), decreased renal perfusion pressure, reduced filtered load, or enhanced proximal fluid reabsorption all lead to a decrease in the flow of tubule fluid past the macula densa, as well as to a decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration. Within seconds after such a transient disturbance, and by an unknown mechanism, TGF dilates the afferent arteriole of the same nephron in an attempt to increase single-nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) and restore fluid and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to that particular macula densa.

In the case of renin release (i.e., the systemic response), by contrast, a sustained fall in arterial pressure or a contraction of the extracellular volume reduces fluid delivery to many maculae
densae, leading to the release of renin. Renin, in turn, causes an increase in local and systemic concentrations of ANG II. Besides causing general vasoconstriction, ANG II constricts the afferent and efferent glomerular arterioles, thereby decreasing GFR. This effect is opposite to that of TGF: TGF dilates a single afferent arteriole, whereas renin release constricts many afferent and efferent arterioles.

TGF may be viewed as a mechanism designed to maintain a constant SNGFR, whereas renin release is aimed at maintaining blood pressure by both systemic and renal vasoconstriction (i.e., hemodynamic effects), as well as by reducing SNGFR and enhancing tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-retaining effects). TGF is a minute-to-minute, fine control of SNGFR that can be superseded by the intermediate- to long-term effects of the powerful renin response, which comes into play whenever plasma volume and blood pressure are jeopardized. It must be emphasized that renin release is governed not only by the JGA but also by other mechanisms, in particular by changes in the activity of sympathetic nerves (see pp. 842-843).

## N40-5 Other Factors that Activate Adenylyl Cyclase in Granular Cells

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch and Erich Windhager

Agents that activate adenylyl cyclase in the granular cells of the JGA-and thus stimulate renin release-include forskolin, $\beta$-adrenergic agonists, $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ adenosine receptor agonists, dopamine, and glucagon. In addition, exogenous cAMP and phosphodiesterase inhibitors enhance renin secretion. All of these agents presumably act through protein kinase A.

Conversely, expansion of the intravascular volume increases renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion; renal denervation sharply reduces this response as well.

Arginine Vasopressin (Antidiuretic Hormone) As discussed below (see p. 844), the posterior pituitary releases AVP primarily in response to increases in extracellular osmolality. Indeed, AVP mainly increases distal-nephron water permeability, promoting water retention (see pp. 817-818). However, the posterior pituitary also releases AVP in response to large reductions in effective circulating volume (e.g., hemorrhage), and secondary actions of AVPvasoconstriction (see p. 553) and promotion of renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ retention (see p. 768)-are appropriate for this stimulus.

Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Of the four parallel effectors that correct a low effective circulating volume (see Fig. 40-2), ANP is the only one that does so by decreasing its activity. As its name implies, ANP promotes natriuresis (i.e., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ excretion). Atrial myocytes synthesize and store ANP and release ANP in response to stretch (a low-pressure volume sensor; see p. 547). Thus, reduced effective circulating volume inhibits ANP release and reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. ANP plays a role in the diuretic response to the redistribution of ECF and plasma volume into the thorax that occurs during water immersion and space flight (see p. 1233).

Acting through a receptor guanylyl cyclase (see pp. 6667), ANP has many synergistic effects (see p. 768) on renal hemodynamics and on transport by renal tubules that promote renal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water excretion. (5) N40-6 Although ANP directly inhibits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport in the inner medullary collecting duct, its major actions are hemodynamicincreased GFR and increased cortical and medullary blood flow. ANP also decreases the release of renin, independently inhibits aldosterone secretion by the adrenal gland, and decreases release of AVP. In summary, a decrease in effective circulating volume leads to a fall in ANP release and a net decrease in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water excretion.

## High arterial pressure raises $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion by hemodynamic mechanisms, independent of changes in effective circulating volume

We have seen that expanding the effective circulating volume stimulates sensors that increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion via four parallel effector pathways (see Fig. 40-2). However, the kidney can also modulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion in response to purely hemodynamic changes, as in the following two examples.

Large and Acute Decrease in Arterial Blood Pressure If glomerulotubular (GT) balance (see p. 763) were perfect, decreasing the GFR would cause $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion to fall linearly (Fig. 40-5, blue line). However, acutely lowering GFR by partial clamping of the aorta causes a steep, nonlinear decrease in urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (see Fig. 40-5, red curve). When GFR falls sufficiently, the kidneys excrete only traces of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$in a small volume of urine. This response primarily reflects the transport of the classical distal tubule (see p. 765), which continues to reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$at a high rate despite the decreased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery.

Figure 40-5 Effect of changes in GFR on urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. The blue line represents ideal glomerulotubular (GT) balance. The red curve summarizes data from dogs. The investigators reduced GFR by inflating a balloon in the aorta, above the level of the renal arteries. They increased GFR by compressing the carotid arteries and thus increased blood pressure. (Data from Thompson DD, Pitts RF: Effects of alterations of renal arterial pressure on sodium and water excretion. Am J Physiol 168:490499, 1952.)

Large Increase in Arterial Pressure In some cases, an increased effective circulating volume is accompanied by an increase in arterial pressure. Examples include primary hyperaldosteronism and Liddle disease (5) N23-14, states of abnormally high distal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption. The excess $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption leads to high blood pressure and compensatory pressure-induced natriuresis. One reason for this pressure diuresis is that hypertension increases GFR, increasing the filtered load of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, which by itself would increase urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (see Fig. 40-5, blue line). However, at least four other mechanisms contribute to the natriuresis (see Fig. 40-5, red curve). First, the increased effective circulating volume inhibits the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and thus reduces $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption (see pp. 765-766). Second, the high blood pressure augments blood flow in the vasa recta, thereby washing out medullary solutes and reducing interstitial hypertonicity in the medulla (see pp. 813-815) and ultimately reducing passive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption in the thin ascending limb (see p. 811). Third, an increase in arterial pressure leads, by an unknown mechanism, to prompt reduction in the number of apical $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchangers in the proximal tubule. Normalizing the blood pressure rapidly reverses this effect. Finally, hypertension leads to increased pressure in the peritubular capillaries, thereby reducing proximal-tubule reabsorption (physical factors; see p. 763).

## CONTROL OF WATER CONTENT (EXTRACELLULAR OSMOLALITY)

Water accounts for half or more of body weight ( 60\% in men and $50 \%$ in women; see p. 102) and is distributed between the ICF and ECF compartments. Changes in totalbody water content in the absence of changes in total-body solute content lead to changes in osmolality, to which the CNS is extremely sensitive. Osmolality deviations of $\pm 15 \%$ lead to severe disturbances of CNS function. Thus, osmoregulation is critical.

Two elements control water content and thus whole-body osmolality: (1) the kidneys, which control water excretion (see pp. 806-807); and (2) thirst mechanisms, which control the oral intake of water. These two effector mechanisms are part of negative-feedback loops that begin within the hypothalamus. An increase in osmolality stimulates separate osmoreceptors to secrete AVP (which reduces renal excretion of free water) and to trigger thirst (which, if fulfilled, increases intake of free water). As a result, the two complementary feedback loops stabilize osmolality and thus $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$.

## Increased plasma osmolality stimulates hypothalamic osmoreceptors that trigger the release of AVP, inhibiting water excretion

An increase in the osmolality of the ECF is the primary signal for the secretion of AVP from the posterior pituitary gland. An elegant series of animal studies by Verney in the 1940s established that infusing a hyperosmotic NaCl solution into the carotid artery abruptly terminates an established water diuresis (Fig. 40-6A). Infusing the same quantity of hyperosmotic NaCl into the peripheral circulation has little effect because the hyperosmolar solution becomes diluted by the time it reaches the cerebral vessels. Therefore, the osmosensitive site is intracranial. Surgically removing the posterior pituitary abolishes the effect of infusing hyperosmotic NaCl into the carotid artery (see Fig. 40-6B). However, injecting posterior-pituitary extracts into the animal inhibits the diuresis, regardless of whether the posterior pituitary is intact. Later work showed that Verney's posterior-pituitary extract contained an "antidiuretic hormone"-now known to be AVP-that the posterior pituitary secretes in response to increased plasma osmolality. Ingesting large volumes of water causes plasma osmolality to fall, thus leading to reduced AVP secretion.

In healthy individuals, plasma osmolality is $\sim 290 \mathrm{mOsm}$. The threshold for AVP release is somewhat lower, $\sim 280 \mathrm{mOsm}$ (Fig. 40-7, red curve). Increasing the osmolality by only $1 \%$ higher than this level is sufficient to produce a detectable increase in plasma [AVP], which rises steeply with further increases in osmolality. Thus, hyperosmolality leads to increased levels of AVP, which completes the feedback loop by causing the kidneys to retain free water (see pp. 817-818).

Although changes in plasma $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ are usually responsible for changes in plasma osmolality, other solutes can do the same. For example, hypertonic mannitol resembles NaCl in stimulating AVP release. However, an equivalent increase in extracellular osmolality by urea has little effect on plasma AVP levels. The reason is that urea readily permeates cell membranes and hence exerts a low effective

## Hypothalamic neurons synthesize AVP and transport it along their axons to the posterior pituitary, where they store it in nerve terminals prior to release

Osmoreceptors of the CNS appear to be located in two areas that breech the blood-brain barrier: the organum

![bo15221257579](bo15221257579.jpg)

Figure 40-8 Control of AVP synthesis and release by osmoreceptors. Osmoreceptors are located in the OVLT and SFO, two areas that breech the blood-brain barrier. Signals from atrial low-pressure baroreceptors travel with the vagus nerve to the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS); a second neuron carries the signal to the hypothalamus. aa, amino acids.
vasculosum of the lamina terminalis (OVLT) and the subfornical organ (SFO), two of the circumventricular organs (see pp. 284-285). Specific neurons in these regions (Fig. 40-8) are able to sense changes in plasma osmolality. Elevated osmolality increases the activity of mechanosensitive cation
channels located in the neuronal membrane, which results in depolarization and thus an increased frequency of action potentials. Hypo-osmolality causes a striking decrease of frequency. The osmosensitive neurons project to large-diameter neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the anterior hypothalamus (see Fig. 40-8). These neurons synthesize AVP, package it into granules, and transport the granules along their axons to nerve terminals in the posterior lobe of the pituitary, which is part of the brain (see pp. 979981). When stimulated by the osmosensitive neurons, these magnocellular neurons release the stored AVP into the posterior pituitary-an area that also lacks a blood-brain barrier-and AVP enters the general circulation.

In humans and most mammals, the antidiuretic hormone is AVP, which is encoded by the messenger RNA for preproneurophysin II. After cleavage of the signal peptide, the resulting prohormone proneurophysin II contains AVP, neurophysin II (NpII), and a glycopeptide (see Fig. 40-8). Cleavage of the prohormone within the secretory granule yields these three components. AVP has nine amino acids, with a disulfide bridge connecting two cysteine residues. Mutations of NpII impair AVP secretion, which suggests that NpII assists in the processing or secretion of AVP.

Levels of circulating AVP depend on both the rate of AVP release from the posterior pituitary and the rate of AVP degradation. The major factor controlling AVP release is plasma osmolality. However, as discussed below, other factors also can modulate AVP secretion.

Two organs, the liver and the kidney, contribute to the breakdown of AVP and the rapid decline of AVP levels when secretion has ceased. The half-life of AVP in the circulation is 18 minutes. Diseases of the liver and kidney may impair AVP degradation and may thereby contribute to water retention. For example, the congestion of the liver and impairment of renal function that accompany heart failure can compromise AVP breakdown, leading to inappropriately high circulating levels of AVP. Conversely, in pregnancy, placental vasopressinase activity can accelerate degradation of AVP.

## Increased osmolality stimulates a second group of osmoreceptors that trigger thirst, which promotes water intake

The second efferent pathway of the osmoregulatory system is thirst, which regulates the oral intake of water. Like the osmoreceptors that trigger AVP release, the osmoreceptors that trigger thirst are located in two circumventricular organs, the OVLT and the SFO. Also like the osmoreceptors that trigger AVP release, those that trigger thirst respond to the cell shrinkage that is caused by hyperosmolar solutions. However, these thirst osmoreceptor neurons are distinct from the adjacent AVP osmoreceptor neurons in the OVLT and SFO.

Hyperosmolality triggers two parallel feedback-control mechanisms that have a common end point (Fig. 40-9): an increase in whole-body free water. In response to hyperosmolality, the AVP osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus trigger other neurons to release AVP. The result is the insertion of aquaporin 2 (AQP2) water channels in the collecting duct of the kidney, an increase in the reabsorption of water, and, therefore, a reduced excretion of free water. In response

![bo15321257579](bo15321257579.jpg)

to hyperosmolality, the thirst osmoreceptors stimulate an appetite for water that leads to the increased intake of free water. The net effect is an increase in whole-body free water and, therefore, a reduction in osmolality.

## Several nonosmotic stimuli also enhance AVP secretion

Although an increase in plasma osmolality is the primary trigger for AVP release, several other stimuli increase AVP release, including a decrease in effective circulating volume or arterial pressure and pregnancy. Conversely, volume expansion diminishes AVP release.

Reduced Effective Circulating Volume As noted above on page 846, a mere $1 \%$ rise in plasma osmolality stimulates AVP release by a detectable amount. However, fairly large reductions in effective circulating volume ( $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ ) are required to stimulate AVP release of similar amounts. Nevertheless, once the rather high threshold for nonosmotic release of AVP is exceeded, AVP release rises steeply with further volume depletion. The interaction between osmotic and volume stimuli on AVP release is illustrated in Figure 40-7, which shows that the effective circulating volume modifies the slope of the relationship between plasma AVP levels and osmolality, as well as the osmotic threshold for AVP release. At a fixed osmolality, volume contraction (see Fig. 40-7, green curve) increases the rate of AVP release. Therefore, during volume depletion, a low plasma osmolality (e.g., 280 mOsm ) that would normally suppress AVP release allows AVP secretion to continue (see Fig. 40-7, green dot). This leftward shift of the osmolality threshold for AVP release is accompanied by an increased slope, reflecting an increased sensitivity of the osmoreceptors to changes in osmolality.

Figure 40-9 summarizes the three pathways by which decreased effective circulating volume and low arterial pressure enhance AVP release: (1) A reduction in left atrial pressure-produced by volume depletion-via low-pressure receptors in the left atrium decreases the firing rate of vagal afferents (see p. 547). These afferents signal brainstem neurons in the nucleus tractus solitarii, causing magnocellular neurons in the hypothalamus to release AVP (see Fig. 40-8). Indeed, at constant osmolality, AVP secretion varies inversely with left atrial pressure. (2) Low effective circulating volume triggers granular cells in the JGA to release renin. This leads to the formation of ANG II, which acts on receptors in the OVLT and the SFO to stimulate AVP release. (3) More importantly, a fall in the arterial pressure similarly causes high-pressure carotid sinus baroreceptors to stimulate AVP release (see pp. 534-536).

Two clinical examples in which reduced effective circulating volume leads to increases in AVP are severe hemorrhagic shock and hypovolemic shock (e.g., shock resulting from excessive loss of ECF, as in cholera). In both cases, the water retention caused by AVP release accounts for the accompanying hyponatremia. In the first part of this chapter, we said that the appropriate renal response to decreased effective circulating volume is to retain $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(i.e., isotonic saline). Why is it that, in response to shock, the body also retains free water? Compared with isotonic saline, free water is less effective as an expander of the ECF volume (see p. 135). Nevertheless, in times of profound need, the body uses free-water retention to help expand extracellular (and plasma) volume. Clearly, the body is willing to tolerate some hypo-osmolality of the body fluids as the price for maintaining an adequate blood volume.

A clinical example in which reduced effective circulating volume can lead to an inappropriate increase in AVP levels is congestive heart failure (see p. 838). In this situation, the water retention may be so severe that the patient develops hyponatremia (i.e., hypo-osmolality).

Volume Expansion In contrast to volume contraction, chronic volume expansion reduces AVP secretion, as a consequence of the rightward shift of the threshold to higher osmolalities and of a decline in the slope (see Fig. 40-7, blue curve). In other words, volume expansion decreases the sensitivity of the central osmoreceptors to changes in plasma osmolality. A clinical example is hyperaldosteronism. With normal thirst and water excretion, the chronic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ retention resulting from the hyperaldosteronism would expand the ECF volume isotonically, thus leaving plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$unchanged. However, because chronic volume expansion downregulates AVP release, the kidneys do not retain adequate water, which results in slight hypernatremia (i.e., elevated plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$) and very modest hyperosmolality (Box 40-3).

Pregnancy Leftward shifts in the threshold for AVP release and thirst often occur during pregnancy. These changes probably reflect the action of chorionic gonadotropin on the sensitivity of the osmoreceptors. Pregnancy is therefore often associated with a decrease of 8 to 10 mOsm

# BOX 40-3 Diuretics 

D
iuretics reversibly inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption at specific sites along the nephron, increasing the excretion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and water, creating a state of negative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance, and thereby contracting ECF volume. Properly speaking, these agents should be called natriuretic to emphasize this use to promote $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. This is in contrast to aquaretic agents (e.g., vasopressin receptor antagonists, or VRAs) that promote water excretion with little or no effect on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion. Nevertheless, it has been customary to refer to natriuretics as diuretics.

Clinicians use diuretics to treat hypertension as well as edema (see Box 20-1) caused by heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, or nephrotic syndrome. Common to these latter edematous diseases is an abnormal shift of ECF away from the effective circulating volume, which thereby activates the feedback pathways. The results are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention and expansion of total extracellular volume. However, this expansion, which results in edema formation, falls short of correcting the underlying decrease in the effective circulating volume. The reason that most of this added extracellular volume remains ineffective-and does not restore the effective circulating volume-is not intuitive but reflects the underlying pathologic condition that initiated the edema in the first place. Thus, treating these edematous diseases requires generating a negative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance, which can often be achieved by rigid dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$restriction or the use of diuretics. Diuretics are also useful in treating hypertension. Even though the primary cause of the hypertension may not always be an increase in the effective circulating volume, enhanced $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion is frequently effective in lowering blood pressure.

## Classification

The site and mechanism of a diuretic's action determine the magnitude and nature of the response (Table 40-3). Both chemically and functionally, diuretics are very heterogeneous. For example, acetazolamide produces diuresis by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase and thus the component of proximal-tubule $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$
reabsorption that is coupled to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption. The diuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazide is largely the result of its ability to inhibit $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport in the distal convoluted tubule. Spironolactone (which resembles aldosterone) competitively inhibits mineralocorticoid receptors in principal cells of the initial and cortical collecting tubule. Mannitol (reduced fructose) is a powerful osmotic diuretic (see Box 35-1) that reduces net $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ transport in the proximal tubule and TAL by causing retention of water in the lumen and reduction in luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$.

An ideal diuretic should promote the excretion of urine whose composition resembles that of the ECF. Such diuretics do not exist. In reality, diuretics not only inhibit the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and its osmotically obligated water, but also interfere with the renal handling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, as well as with urinary concentrating ability. $\Theta$ N40-7 Thus, many diuretics disturb the normal plasma electrolyte pattern. Table 40-4 summarizes the most frequent side effects of diuretic use on the electrolyte composition of the ECF. These electrolyte derangements are the predictable consequences of the mechanism of action of individual diuretics at specific tubule sites.

## Delivery of Diuretics to Their Sites of Action

Diuretics generally inhibit transporters or channels at the apical membranes of tubule cells. How do the diuretics get there? Plasma proteins bind many diuretics so that the free concentration of the diuretic in plasma water may be fairly low. Thus, glomerular filtration may deliver only a modest amount to the tubule fluid. However, organic anion or organic cation transporters in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule can secrete diuretics and can thereby produce high luminal concentrations. For example, the basolateral organic anion transporter system that carries para-aminohippurate (see pp. 779-781) also secretes thiazide diuretics, furosemide, and ethacrynic acid. Organic cation transporters (see pp. 783-784) secrete amiloride. The subsequent reabsorption of fluid along the nephron further concentrates diuretics in the tubule lumen. Not surprisingly, renal

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As noted in the text, the perfect diuretic-which does not existwould produce an increase in the urinary excretion of protein-free fluid with a composition otherwise identical to that of the ECL. However, diuretics not only inhibit the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and the osmotically obligated water, but also interfere with the renal handling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, as well as with urinary concentrating ability.

1. Urine $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$. With the exception of carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, all diuretics promote the excretion of urine having a high $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$. The ratio $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is greater in the urine than in the plasma.
2. Urine $\mathbf{p H}$. Because of its inhibition of proximal-tubule $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ reabsorption, acetazolamide leads to excretion of a relatively alkaline urine. Thus, acetazolamide produces a mild metabolic acidosis. In contrast, the loop diuretics and thiazides cause the excretion of a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-rich, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-poor urine, which tends to induce a metabolic alkalosis.
3. Urine $\left[\mathbf{K}^{+}\right]$. Some diuretics are called $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-sparing because they tend to conserve body $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. These diuretics-which include amiloride, triamterene, and spironolactone-block
only a small fraction of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, but reduce $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion through apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels by hyperpolarizing the apical cell membrane. By inhibiting passive cation movement, they may induce hyperkalemia. This hyperkalemia may lead to metabolic acidosis (see p. 835).
4. Urine $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. With the exception of the chlorothiazides, most diuretics enhance $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ excretion. They interfere with the passive reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ through the paracellular pathway in both the proximal tubule and TAL (see p. 787). In the proximal tubule, the high luminal flow rate produced by the diuresis reduces the reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ via solvent drag. In the TAL, loop diuretics diminish the lumen-positive potential that normally drives the passive reabsorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.
5. Urine osmolality. Loop diuretics diminish the urinary concentrating ability by inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport in the TAL (see p. 811).
Clinical side effects of diuretic therapy are summarized in Table 40-4.

disease may compromise the delivery of diuretics and cause resistance to the actions of diuretics. N40-8

## Response of Nephron Segments Downstream from a Diuretic's Site of Action

The proximal tubule reabsorbs the largest fraction of filtered $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$; the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting ducts retrieve smaller fractions. Thus, intuition could suggest that the proximal tubule would be the best target for diuretics. However, secondary effects in downstream nephron segments can substantially mitigate the primary effect of a diuretic. Inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport by the proximal tubule raises $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$delivery to downstream segments and almost always stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ reabsorption there (see p. 765). As a result of this downstream $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reclamation, the overall diuretic action of proximally acting diuretics (e.g., acetazolamide) is relatively weak.

A diuretic is most potent if it acts downstream of the proximal tubule, a condition met by loop diuretics, which inhibit $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport along the TAL. Although the TAL normally reabsorbs only $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ of the filtered load of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, the reabsorptive capacity of the more distal nephron segments is limited. Thus, the loop diuretics are currently the most powerful diuretic agents. Because nephron segments distal to the TAL have only modest rates of
$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$reabsorption, diuretics that target these segments are not as potent as loop diuretics. Nevertheless, distally acting diuretics are important because their effects are long lasting. Moreover, agents acting on the connecting and collecting tubules are $\mathbf{K}^{+}$ sparing (i.e., they tend to conserve body $\mathrm{K}^{+}$).

It is sometimes advantageous to use two diuretics that act at different sites along the nephron, generating a synergistic effect. Thus, if a loop diuretic alone is providing inadequate diuresis, one could complement its action by adding a thiazide, which will block the compensating effect of the distal convoluted tubule to reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

## Blunting of Diuretic Action with Long-Term Use

The prolonged administration of a diuretic may lead to a sustained loss of body weight but only transient natriuresis. N40-9 Most of the decline in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion occurs because the druginduced fall in effective circulating volume triggers $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention mediated by increased sympathetic outflow to the kidneys (which lowers GFR), increased secretion of ANG II and aldosterone, and decreased secretion of ANP. Hypertrophy or increased activity of tubule segments downstream of the main site of action of the diuretic can also contribute to the diminished efficacy of the drug during long-term administration.

Other Factors Pain, nausea, and several drugs (e.g., morphine, nicotine, and high doses of barbiturates) stimulate AVP secretion. In contrast, alcohol and drugs that block the effect of morphine (opiate antagonists) inhibit AVP secretion
and thus promote diuresis. Of great clinical importance is the hypersecretion of AVP that may occur postoperatively. In addition, some malignant tumors secrete large amounts of AVP. Such secretion of inappropriate amounts of "antidiuretic hormone" leads to pathological retention of water with dilution of the plasma electrolytes, particularly $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. If progressive and uncorrected, this condition may lead

## N40-8 Reduced Delivery of Diuretics in Renal Disease

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

As noted in the text, diuretics cannot have their intended effects unless they have appropriate access to their protein targets in the tubule cells. The two access routes are filtration and secretion, of which secretion is usually the most important.

Not surprisingly, renal disease may compromise the net secretion of diuretics in three ways. First, the capability of the diseased cells to secrete diuretics may be impaired (i.e., decreased transport). Second, renal failure leads to a buildup in the blood of organic anions that would otherwise be secreted. These organic anions may competitively inhibit the transport of diuretics by the proximal tubule (i.e., competition). Third, in renal diseases in which breakdown of the glomerular filtration barrier leads to proteinuria, albumin and other proteins not normally present in the tubule lumen bind the diuretics and greatly reduce the concentration of unbound drug (i.e., binding).

## N40-9 Blunting of Diuretic Action

## Contributed by Erich Windhager and Gerhard Giebisch

Let us assume that a patient has a fixed daily intake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. As noted in the text, the administration of a diuretic will cause an initial period of increased $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion (negative $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ balance), peaking within a few days, that leads to a loss in weight. During prolonged administration of the diuretic, urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion will fall back toward normal over a period of many days, and the patient will reach a steady state (neutral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance) in which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake and excretion are equal, and in which the initial weight loss is maintained.

When the drug is discontinued, the patient will experience a transient period of diminished urinary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$excretion, reaching a nadir after a few days. During this time he or she is in positive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance. As a result, the patient will regain the weight that was lost during the initial phase of the diuretic treatment. However, over a period of many days, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ excretion eventually rises back to a normal level as the patient achieves a new steady state (neutral $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$balance) in which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$intake and excretion are again equal, and the patient maintains a prediuretic weight.

## Decreased effective circulating volume and low arterial pressure also trigger thirst

Large decreases in effective circulating volume and blood pressure not only stimulate the release of AVP, they also profoundly stimulate the sensation of thirst. In fact, hemorrhage is one of the most powerful stimuli of hypovolemic thirst: "Thirst among the wounded on the battlefield is legendary" (Fitzsimons). Therefore, three distinct stimulihyperosmolality, profound volume contraction, and large decreases in blood pressure-lead to the sensation of thirst. Low effective circulating volume and low blood pressure stimulate thirst centers in the hypothalamus via the same pathways by which they stimulate AVP release (see Fig. 40-9).

In addition to stimulating thirst, some of these hypothalamic areas are also involved in stimulating the desire to ingest salt (i.e., $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$appetite). We discuss the role of the hypothalamus in the control of appetite on page 1001.

## Defense of the effective circulating volume usually has priority over defense of osmolality

Under physiological conditions, the body regulates plasma volume and plasma osmolality independently. However, as discussed on page 847, this clear separation of defense mechanisms against volume and osmotic challenges breaks down when more dramatic derangements of fluid or salt metabolism occur. In general, the body defends volume at the expense of osmolality. Examples include severe reductions in absolute blood volume (e.g., hemorrhage) and decreases in effective circulating volume even when absolute ECF volume may be expanded (e.g., congestive heart failure, nephrotic syndrome, and liver cirrhosis). All are conditions that strongly stimulate both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$- and water-retaining mechanisms. However, hyponatremia can be the consequence. (T) N40-10

# N40-10 Defense of Osmolality at the Expense of Effective Circulating Volume During Dehydration 

## Contributed by Gerhard Giebisch, Erich Windhager, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

An exception to the rule of defending volume over osmolality occurs during severe water loss (i.e., dehydration; see p. 1215). In this case, the hyperosmolality that accompanies the dehydration maximally stimulates AVP secretion and thirst (see Fig. 40-9). Of course, severe dehydration also reduces total-body volume. However, this loss of free water occurs at the expense of both intracellular water ( $\sim 60 \%$ ) and extracellular water ( $\sim 40 \%$ ). Thus, dehydration does not put the effective circulating volume at as great a risk as the acute loss of an equivalent volume of blood. Because dehydration reduces effective circulating volume, one might think that the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis would lead to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention during dehydration. However, the opposite effect may occur, possibly because hyperosmolality makes the glomerulosa cells of the adrenal medulla less sensitive to ANG II and thereby reduces the release of aldosterone. Thus, the kidneys fail to retain $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$appropriately. Accordingly, in severe
dehydration, the net effect is an attempt to correct hyperosmolality by both water intake and retention, as well as by the loss of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(i.e., natriuresis) that occurs because aldosterone levels are inappropriately low for the effective circulating volume. Therefore, in severe dehydration, the body violates the principle of defending volume over osmolality.

If the dehydration occurs during exercise, the drive to preserve effective circulating volume will trump temperature regulation (see p. 1215), offsetting the earlier vasodilation of the skin and active muscle. We can infer that the exercise-induced dehydration, by triggering thirst and AVP secretion (see previous paragraph), leads to a correction of the hyperosmolality and an increase in effective circulating volume that, once again, allows the individual to sweat and effectively regulate whole-body temperature.

# ORGANIZATION OF THE GASTROINTESTINAL SYSTEM 

Henry J. Binder

## OVERVIEW OF DIGESTIVE PROCESSES

## The gastrointestinal tract is a tube that is specialized along its length for the sequential processing of food

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of both the series of hollow organs stretching from the mouth to the anus and the several accessory glands and organs that add secretions to these hollow organs (Fig. 41-1). Each of these hollow organs, which are separated from each other at key locations by sphincters, has evolved to serve a specialized function. The mouth and oropharynx are responsible for chopping food into small pieces, lubricating it, initiating carbohydrate and fat digestion, and propelling the food into the esophagus. The esophagus acts as a conduit to the stomach. The stomach (see Chapter 42) temporarily stores food and also initiates digestion by churning and by secreting proteases and acid. The small intestine (see Chapters 44 and 45) continues the work of digestion and is the primary site for the absorption of nutrients. The large intestine (see Chapters 44 and 45) reabsorbs fluids and electrolytes and also stores the fecal matter before expulsion from the body. The accessory glands and organs include the salivary glands, pancreas, and liver. The pancreas (see Chapter 43) secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, in addition to secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to neutralize gastric acid. The liver secretes bile (see Chapter 46), which the gallbladder stores for future delivery to the duodenum during a meal. Bile contains bile acids, which play a key role in the digestion of fats.

Although the anatomy of the wall of the GI tract varies along its length, certain organizational themes are common to all segments. Figure 41-2, a cross section through a generic piece of stomach or intestine, shows the characteristic layered structure of mucosa, submucosa, muscle, and serosa.

The mucosa consists of the epithelial layer, as well as an underlying layer of loose connective tissue known as the lamina propria, which contains capillaries, enteric neurons, and immune cells (e.g., mast cells), as well as a thin layer of smooth muscle known as the lamina muscularis mucosae (literally, the muscle layer of the mucosa). The surface area of the epithelial layer is amplified by several mechanisms. Most cells have microvilli on their apical surfaces. In addition, the layer of epithelial cells can be evaginated to form villi or invaginated to form crypts (or glands). Finally, on a larger scale, the mucosa is organized into large folds.

The submucosa consists of loose connective tissue and larger blood vessels. The submucosa may also contain glands that secrete material into the GI lumen.

The muscle layer, the muscularis externa, includes two layers of smooth muscle. The inner layer is circular, whereas the outer layer is longitudinal. Enteric neurons are present between these two muscle layers.

The serosa is an enveloping layer of connective tissue that is covered with squamous epithelial cells.

## Assimilation of dietary food substances requires digestion as well as absorption

The sedentary human body requires $\sim 30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight each day (see p. 1170). This nutrient requirement is normally acquired by the oral intake of multiple food substances that the GI tract then assimilates. Although antigenic amounts of protein enter the body via the skin and across the pulmonary epithelium, caloric uptake by routes other than the GI tract is not thought to occur. Both the small and large intestines absorb water and electrolytes, but only the small intestine absorbs lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. However, even without effective GI function, parenteral (i.e., intravenous) alimentation can provide sufficient calories to sustain adults and to support growth in premature infants. Total parenteral nutrition has been used successfully on a long-term basis in many clinical settings in which oral intake is impossible or undesirable.

Food substances are not necessarily-and often areconsumed in a chemical form that the small intestine can directly absorb. To facilitate absorption, the GI tract digests the food by both mechanical and chemical processes.

Mechanical disruption of ingested food begins in the mouth with chewing (mastication). Individuals without teeth usually require their solid food to be cut into smaller pieces before eating. The mechanical processes that alter food composition to facilitate absorption continue in the stomach (see p. 865), both to initiate protein and lipid enzymatic digestion and to allow passage of gastric contents through the pylorus into the duodenum. This change in the size and consistency of gastric contents is necessary because solids that are $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter do not pass through the pylorus.

The chemical form in which different nutrients are ingested and absorbed varies according to the specific nutrient in question. For example, although most lipids are consumed in the form of triacylglycerols, it is fatty acids and monoacylglycerols, not triacylglycerols, that are absorbed by the small intestine. Thus, a complex series of chemical reactions (i.e., lipid digestion) are required to convert dietary
