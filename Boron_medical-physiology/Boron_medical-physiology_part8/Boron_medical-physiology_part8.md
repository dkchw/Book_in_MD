## OVERVIEW OF DIGESTIVE PROCESSES

## The gastrointestinal tract is a tube that is specialized along its length for the sequential processing of food

The gastrointestinal (GI) tract consists of both the series of hollow organs stretching from the mouth to the anus and the several accessory glands and organs that add secretions to these hollow organs (Fig. 41-1). Each of these hollow organs, which are separated from each other at key locations by sphincters, has evolved to serve a specialized function. The mouth and oropharynx are responsible for chopping food into small pieces, lubricating it, initiating carbohydrate and fat digestion, and propelling the food into the esophagus. The esophagus acts as a conduit to the stomach. The stomach (see Chapter 42) temporarily stores food and also initiates digestion by churning and by secreting proteases and acid. The small intestine (see Chapters 44 and 45) continues the work of digestion and is the primary site for the absorption of nutrients. The large intestine (see Chapters 44 and 45) reabsorbs fluids and electrolytes and also stores the fecal matter before expulsion from the body. The accessory glands and organs include the salivary glands, pancreas, and liver. The pancreas (see Chapter 43) secretes digestive enzymes into the duodenum, in addition to secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to neutralize gastric acid. The liver secretes bile (see Chapter 46), which the gallbladder stores for future delivery to the duodenum during a meal. Bile contains bile acids, which play a key role in the digestion of fats.

Although the anatomy of the wall of the GI tract varies along its length, certain organizational themes are common to all segments. Figure 41-2, a cross section through a generic piece of stomach or intestine, shows the characteristic layered structure of mucosa, submucosa, muscle, and serosa.

The mucosa consists of the epithelial layer, as well as an underlying layer of loose connective tissue known as the lamina propria, which contains capillaries, enteric neurons, and immune cells (e.g., mast cells), as well as a thin layer of smooth muscle known as the lamina muscularis mucosae (literally, the muscle layer of the mucosa). The surface area of the epithelial layer is amplified by several mechanisms. Most cells have microvilli on their apical surfaces. In addition, the layer of epithelial cells can be evaginated to form villi or invaginated to form crypts (or glands). Finally, on a larger scale, the mucosa is organized into large folds.

The submucosa consists of loose connective tissue and larger blood vessels. The submucosa may also contain glands that secrete material into the GI lumen.

The muscle layer, the muscularis externa, includes two layers of smooth muscle. The inner layer is circular, whereas the outer layer is longitudinal. Enteric neurons are present between these two muscle layers.

The serosa is an enveloping layer of connective tissue that is covered with squamous epithelial cells.

## Assimilation of dietary food substances requires digestion as well as absorption

The sedentary human body requires $\sim 30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight each day (see p. 1170). This nutrient requirement is normally acquired by the oral intake of multiple food substances that the GI tract then assimilates. Although antigenic amounts of protein enter the body via the skin and across the pulmonary epithelium, caloric uptake by routes other than the GI tract is not thought to occur. Both the small and large intestines absorb water and electrolytes, but only the small intestine absorbs lipids, carbohydrates, and amino acids. However, even without effective GI function, parenteral (i.e., intravenous) alimentation can provide sufficient calories to sustain adults and to support growth in premature infants. Total parenteral nutrition has been used successfully on a long-term basis in many clinical settings in which oral intake is impossible or undesirable.

Food substances are not necessarily-and often areconsumed in a chemical form that the small intestine can directly absorb. To facilitate absorption, the GI tract digests the food by both mechanical and chemical processes.

Mechanical disruption of ingested food begins in the mouth with chewing (mastication). Individuals without teeth usually require their solid food to be cut into smaller pieces before eating. The mechanical processes that alter food composition to facilitate absorption continue in the stomach (see p. 865), both to initiate protein and lipid enzymatic digestion and to allow passage of gastric contents through the pylorus into the duodenum. This change in the size and consistency of gastric contents is necessary because solids that are $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter do not pass through the pylorus.

The chemical form in which different nutrients are ingested and absorbed varies according to the specific nutrient in question. For example, although most lipids are consumed in the form of triacylglycerols, it is fatty acids and monoacylglycerols, not triacylglycerols, that are absorbed by the small intestine. Thus, a complex series of chemical reactions (i.e., lipid digestion) are required to convert dietary

![bo014869338f](bo014869338f.jpg)

Figure 41-1 Major components of the human digestive system.
triacylglycerols to these smaller lipid forms (see pp. 927928). Similarly, amino acids are present in food as proteins and large peptides, but only amino acids and small peptidesprimarily dipeptides and tripeptides-are absorbed by the small intestine. Carbohydrates are present in the diet as starch, disaccharides, and monosaccharides (e.g., glucose). However, because the small intestine absorbs all carbohydrates as monosaccharides, most dietary carbohydrates require chemical digestion before their absorption.

## Digestion requires enzymes secreted in the mouth, stomach, pancreas, and small intestine

Digestion involves the conversion of dietary food nutrients to a form that the small intestine can absorb. For carbohydrates and lipids, these digestive processes are initiated in the mouth by salivary and lingual enzymes: amylase for carbohydrates and lipase for lipids. Protein digestion is initiated in the stomach by gastric proteases (i.e., pepsins), whereas additional lipid digestion in the stomach occurs primarily as a result of the lingual lipase that is swallowed, although some gastric lipase is also secreted. Carbohydrate digestion does not involve any secreted gastric enzymes.

Digestion is completed in the small intestine by the action of both pancreatic enzymes and enzymes at the brush border of the small intestine. Pancreatic enzymes, which include
lipase, chymotrypsin, and amylase, are critical for the digestion of lipids, protein, and carbohydrates, respectively. The enzymes on the luminal surface of the small intestine (e.g., brush-border disaccharidases and dipeptidases) complete the digestion of carbohydrates and proteins. Digestion by these brush-border enzymes is referred to as membrane digestion.

The material presented to the small intestine includes both dietary intake and secretory products. The food material entering the small intestine differs considerably from the ingested material because of the mechanical and chemical changes just discussed. The load to the small intestine is also significantly greater than that of the ingested material. Dietary fluid intake is 1.5 to $2.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, whereas the fluid load presented to the small intestine is 8 to $9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. The increased volume results from substantial quantities of salivary, gastric, biliary, pancreatic, and small-intestinal secretions. These secretions contain large amounts of protein, primarily in the form of the digestive enzymes discussed above.

## Ingestion of food initiates multiple endocrine, neural, and paracrine responses

Digestion of food involves multiple secretory, enzymatic, and motor processes that are closely coordinated with one another. The necessary control is achieved by neural and hormonal processes that are initiated by dietary food substances; the result is a coordinated series of motor and secretory responses. For example, chemoreceptors, osmoreceptors, and mechanoreceptors in the mucosa in large part generate the afferent stimuli that induce gastric and pancreatic secretions. These receptors sense the luminal contents and initiate a neurohumoral response.

Endocrine, neural, and paracrine mechanisms all contribute to digestion. All three include sensor and transmitter processes. An endocrine mechanism (see p. 47) involves the release of a transmitter (e.g., peptide) into the blood.

For example, protein in the stomach stimulates the release of gastrin from antral G cells. Gastrin then enters the blood and stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$release from parietal cells in the body of the stomach. A neural mechanism involves the activation of nerves and neurotransmitters that influence either secretory or motor activity. Neural transmission of these responses may involve the enteric nervous system (ENS; see pp. 339340) or the central nervous system (CNS). An example of neural control is activation of the vagus nerve in response to the smell of food. The resultant release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) also releases $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from parietal cells in the stomach.

The third mechanism of neurohumoral control is paracrine (see p. 47). In this mechanism, a transmitter is released from a sensor cell, and it affects adjacent cells without either entering the blood or activating neurons. For example, paracrine mechanisms help regulate gastric acid secretion by parietal cells: the histamine released from so-called enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the body of the stomach stimulates $\mathrm{H}^{+}$release from neighboring parietal cells.

In addition to the primary response that leads to the release of one or more digestive enzymes, other signals terminate these secretory responses. Enteric neurons are

important throughout the initiation and termination of the responses.

Although the endocrine, neural, and paracrine responses are most often studied separately, with considerable effort made to isolate individual events, these responses do not occur as isolated events. Rather, each type is part of an integrated response to a meal that results in the digestion and absorption of food. This entire series of events that results from the ingestion of food can best be described as an integrated response that includes both afferent and efferent limbs.

## In addition to its function in nutrition, the GI tract

plays important roles in excretion, fluid and electrolyte balance, and immunity

Although its primary roles are digesting and absorbing nutrients, the GI tract also excretes waste material. Fecal material includes nondigested/nonabsorbed dietary food products, colonic bacteria and their metabolic products, and several excretory products. These excretory products include (1) heavy metals such as iron and copper, whose major route of excretion is in bile; and (2) several organic anions and cations, including drugs, that are excreted in bile but are reabsorbed either poorly or not at all by either the small or large intestine.

As noted above, the small intestine is presented with 8 to $9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of fluid, an amount that includes $\sim 1 \mathrm{~L} /$ day that the intestine itself secretes. Almost all this water is reabsorbed in the small and large intestine; therefore, stool has relatively small amounts of water ( $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~L} /$ day). Diarrhea (an increase in stool liquidity and weight, $>200 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) results from either increased fluid secretion by the small or large intestine, or decreased fluid reabsorption by the intestines. An important clinical example of diarrhea is cholera, especially in developing countries. Cholera can be fatal because of the water and electrolyte imbalance that it creates. Thus, the GI tract plays a crucial role in maintaining overall fluid and electrolyte balance (see Chapter 44).

The GI tract also contributes to immune function. The mucosal immune system, or gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), consists of both organized aggregates of lymphoid tissue (e.g., Peyer's patches; see Fig. 41-2B) and diffuse populations of immune cells. These immune cells include lymphocytes that reside between the epithelial cells lining the gut, as well as lymphocytes and mast cells in the lamina propria. GALT has two primary functions: (1) to protect against potential microbial pathogens, including bacteria, protozoans, and viruses; and (2) to permit immunological tolerance to both the potentially immunogenic dietary substances and the bacteria that normally reside primarily in the lumen of the large intestine.

The mucosal immune system is important because the GI tract has the largest area of the body in potential direct contact with infectious, toxic, and immunogenic material. Approximately $80 \%$ of the immunoglobulin-producing cells are found in the small intestine. Although GALT has some interaction with the systemic immune system, GALT is operationally distinct. Finally, evidence indicates communication between the GALT and mucosal immune systems at other mucosal surfaces, such as the pulmonary epithelia.

Certain nonimmunological defense processes are also important in protecting against potential luminal pathogens and in limiting the uptake of macromolecules from the GI tract. The nonimmunological mechanisms that are critical in maintaining the ecology of intestinal flora include gastric acid secretion, intestinal mucin, peristalsis, and the epithelial-cell permeability barrier. Thus, whereas relatively low levels of aerobic bacteria are present in the lumen of the small intestine of physiologically normal subjects, individuals with impaired small-intestinal peristalsis often have substantially higher levels of both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in their small intestine. A consequence may be diarrhea or steatorrhea (i.e., increased fecal fat excretion). The clinical manifestation of impaired intestinal peristalsis is referred to as either blind loop syndrome or stagnant bowel syndrome.

## REGULATION OF GASTROINTESTINAL FUNCTION

## The ENS is a "minibrain" with sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons

The ENS (see pp. 339-340) is the primary neural mechanism that controls GI function and is one of the three divisions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), along with the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions. One indication of the importance of the ENS is the number of neurons consigned to it. The ENS consists of $\sim 100$ million neurons, roughly the number in the spinal cord or in the rest of the entire ANS. The ENS is located solely within GI tissue, but it can be modified by input from the brain. Neurons of the ENS are primarily, but not exclusively, clustered in one of two collections of neurons (Fig. 41-3A): the submucosal plexus and the myenteric plexus. The submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus is found in the submucosa only in the small and large intestine. The myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus is located between the circular and longitudinal muscle layers throughout the GI tract from the proximal end of the esophagus to the rectum.

The ENS is a complete reflex circuit and can operate totally within the GI tract, without the participation of either the spinal cord or the cephalic brain. As with other neurons, the activity of the ENS is the result of the generation of action potentials by single neurons and the release of chemical neurotransmitters that affect either other neurons or effector cells (i.e., epithelial or muscle cells). The ENS consists of sensory circuits, interneuronal connections, and secretomotor neurons (see Fig. 41-3B). Sensory (or afferent) neurons monitor changes in luminal activity, including distention (i.e., smooth-muscle tension), chemistry (e.g., pH , osmolality, levels of specific nutrients), and mechanical stimulation. These sensory neurons activate interneurons, which relay signals that activate efferent secretomotor neurons that in turn stimulate or inhibit a wide range of effector cells: smooth-muscle cells, epithelial cells that secrete or absorb fluid and electrolytes, submucosal blood vessels, and enteric endocrine cells.

The largely independent function of the ENS has given rise to the concept of a GI "minibrain." Because the efferent responses to several different stimuli are often quite similar,

![bo044869338f](bo044869338f.jpg)

Figure 41-3 Schematic representation of the ENS. A, The submucosal (or Meissner's) plexus is located between the muscularis mucosae and the circular muscle of the muscularis externa. The myenteric (or Auerbach's) plexus is located between the circular and longitudinal layers of the muscularis externa. In addition to these two plexuses that have ganglia, three others-the mucosal, deep muscular, and tertiary plexuses-are present. B, The ENS consists of sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. Some sensory signals travel centrally from the ENS. Both the parasympathetic and the sympathetic divisions of the ANS modulate the ENS. This figure illustrates some of the typical circuitry of ENS neurons.
a generalized concept has developed that the ENS possesses multiple preprogrammed responses. For example, both mechanical distention of the jejunum and the presence of a bacterial enterotoxin in the jejunum can elicit identical responses: stimulation of profuse fluid and electrolyte secretion, together with propagated, propulsive, coordinated smooth-muscle contractions. Such preprogrammed efferent responses are probably initiated by sensory input to the enteric interneuronal connections. However, efferent responses controlled by the ENS may also be modified by input from autonomic ganglia, which are in turn under the influence of the spinal cord and brain (see p. 336). ( $\mathbf{N 4 1 - 1}$ In addition, the ENS receives input directly from the brain via parasympathetic nerves (i.e., the vagus nerve).

## ACh, peptides, and bioactive amines are the ENS neurotransmitters that regulate epithelial and motor function

ACh is the primary preganglionic and postganglionic neurotransmitter regulating both secretory function and smooth-muscle activity in the GI tract. In addition, many other neurotransmitters are present in enteric neurons. Among the peptides, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)
has an important role in both inhibition of intestinal smooth muscle and stimulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte secretion. Although VIP was first identified in the GI tract, it is now appreciated that VIP is also an important neurotransmitter in the brain (see Table 13-1). Also playing an important role in GI regulation are other peptides (e.g., enkephalins, somatostatin, and substance P), amines (e.g., serotonin), and nitric oxide (NO).

Our understanding of ENS neurotransmitters is evolving, and the list of identified agonists grows ever longer. In addition, substantial species differences exist. Frequently, chemical neurotransmitters are identified in neurons without a clear-cut demonstration of their physiological role in the regulation of organ function. More than one neurotransmitter has been identified within single neurons, a finding suggesting that regulation of some cell functions may require more than one neurotransmitter.

## The brain-gut axis is a bidirectional system that controls GI function via the ANS, GI hormones, and the immune system

Well recognized, but poorly understood, is the modification of several different aspects of GI function by the brain. In

eFigure 41-1 At the lowest level, the ENS is an independent system consisting of afferent neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. One level up, the autonomic ganglia control the autonomic end organs, including the ENS. One further level up, the spinal cord controls certain autonomic ganglia and integrates response among different levels of the spinal cord. The brainstem receives inputs from visceral afferents and coordinates the control of all viscera. Finally, forebrain CNS centers receive input from the brainstem and coordinate the activity of the ANS via input to the brainstem.

other words, neural control of the GI tract is a function of not only intrinsic nerves (i.e., the ENS) but also nerves that are extrinsic to the GI tract. These extrinsic pathways are composed of elements of both the parasympathetic and, to a lesser extent, the sympathetic nervous system and are under the control of autonomic centers in the brainstem (see p. 338).

Parasympathetic innervation of the GI tract from the pharynx to the distal colon is through the vagus nerve; the distal third of the colon receives its parasympathetic innervation from the pelvic nerves (see Fig. 14-4). The preganglionic fibers of the parasympathetic nerves use ACh as their neurotransmitter and synapse on some neurons of the ENS (see Fig. 41-3B). These ENS neurons are thus postganglionic parasympathetic fibers, and their cell bodies are, in a sense, the parasympathetic ganglion. These postganglionic parasympathetic fibers use mainly ACh as their neurotransmitter; however, as noted in the previous section, many other neurotransmitters are also present. Parasympathetic stimulation-after one or more synapses in a very complex ENS network-increases secretion and motility. The parasympathetic nerves also contain afferent fibers (see p. 339) that carry information to autonomic centers in the medulla from chemoreceptors, osmoreceptors, and mechanoreceptors in the mucosa. The loop that is initiated by these afferents, integrated by central autonomic centers, and completed
by the aforementioned parasympathetic efferents, is known as a vagovagal reflex.

The preganglionic sympathetic fibers to the GI tract synapse on postganglionic neurons in the prevertebral ganglia (see Fig. 14-3); the neurotransmitter at this synapse is ACh (see p. 341). The postganglionic sympathetic fibers either synapse in the ENS or directly innervate effector cells (see Fig. 41-3B).

In addition to the control that is entirely within the ENS, as well as control via autonomic centers in the medulla, the GI tract is also under the control of higher CNS centers. Examples of cerebral function that affects GI behavior include the fight-or-flight response, which reduces blood flow to the GI tract, and the sight and smell of food, which increase gastric acid secretion.

Communication between the GI tract and higher CNS centers is bidirectional. For example, cholecystokinin from the GI tract mediates, in part, the development of food satiety in the brain. In addition, gastrin-releasing peptide, a neurotransmitter made in ENS cells (see p. 868), inhibits gastric acid secretion when experimentally injected into the ventricles of the brain. Table 41-1 summarizes peptide hormones made by the GI tract as well as their major actions.

In addition to the "hard-wired" communications involved in sensory input and motor output, communication via the

gut-brain axis also requires significant participation of the immune system. Neuroimmune regulation of both epithelial and motor function in the small and large intestine primarily involves mast cells in the lamina propria of the intestine. Because the mast cells are sensitive to neurotransmitters, they can process information from the brain to the ENS and can also respond to signals from interneurons of the ENS. Mast cells also monitor sensory input from the intestinal lumen by participating in the immune response to foreign antigens. In turn, chemical mediators released by mast cells (e.g., histamine) directly affect both intestinal smooth-muscle cells and epithelial cells. Our understanding of how the immune system modulates the neural control of GI function is rapidly evolving.

In conclusion, three parallel components of the gut-brain axis-the ENS, GI hormones, and the immune systemcontrol GI function, an arrangement that provides substantial redundancy. Such redundancy permits fine-tuning of the regulation of digestive processes and provides "backup" or "fail-safe" mechanisms that ensure the integrity of GI function, especially at times of impaired function (i.e., during disease).

## GASTROINTESTINAL MOTILITY

## Tonic and rhythmic contractions of smooth muscle are responsible for churning, peristalsis, and reservoir action

The motor activity of the GI tract performs three primary functions. First, it produces segmental contractions that are associated with nonpropulsive movement of the luminal contents. The result is the increased mixing-or churning-that enhances the digestion and absorption of dietary nutrients. Second, GI motor activity produces peristalsis, a progressive wave of relaxation followed by contraction. The result is propulsion, or the propagated movement of food and its digestive products in a caudal direction, ultimately eliminating nondigested, nonabsorbed material. Third, motor activity allows some hollow organsparticularly the stomach and large intestine-to hold the luminal content, exerting a reservoir function. This reservoir function is made possible by sphincters that separate the organs of the GI tract. All these functions are primarily accomplished by the coordinated activity of smooth muscle (see pp. 243-249).

The electrical and mechanical properties of intestinal smooth muscle needed for these functions include both tonic (i.e., sustained) contractions and rhythmic contractions (i.e., alternating contraction and relaxation) of individual muscle cells. The intrinsic rhythmic contractility is a function of the membrane voltage $\left(V_{m}\right)$ of the smoothmuscle cell. $V_{m}$ can either oscillate in a subthreshold range at a low frequency (several cycles per minute), referred to as slow-wave activity, or reach a threshold for initiating a true action potential (see Fig. 9-14). The integrated effect of the slow waves and action potentials determines the smoothmuscle activity of the GI tract. Slow-wave activity apparently occurs as voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels depolarize the cell and increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, followed by the opening of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, which repolarize the cell (see p. 244).

These activities are regulated, in large part, by both neural and hormonal stimuli. Modulation of intestinal smoothmuscle contraction is largely a function of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ (see pp. 246-247). Several agonists regulate $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ by one of two mechanisms: (1) activating G protein-linked receptors, which results in the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores; or (2) opening and closing of plasma-membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Both excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters can modulate smooth-muscle $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thus contractility. In general, ACh is the predominant neurotransmitter of excitatory motor neurons, whereas VIP and NO are the neurotransmitters of inhibitory motor neurons. Different neural or hormonal inputs probably increase (or decrease) the frequency with which $V_{m}$ exceeds threshold and produces an action potential and thus increases (or decreases) muscle contractility.

An additional, unique factor in the aforementioned regulatory control is that luminal food and digestive products activate mucosal chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors, as discussed above, thus inducing hormone release or stimulating the ENS and controlling smooth-muscle function. For example, gastric contents with elevated osmolality or a high lipid content entering the duodenum activate mucosal osmoreceptors and chemoreceptors that increase the release of cholecystokinin and thus delay gastric emptying (see p. 878).

## Segments of the GI tract have both longitudinal and circular arrays of muscles and are separated by sphincters that consist of specialized circular muscles

The muscle layers of the GI tract consist almost entirely of smooth muscle. Exceptions are the striated muscle of (1) the upper esophageal sphincter (UES), which separates the hypopharynx from the esophagus; (2) the upper third of the esophagus; and (3) the external anal sphincter. As shown above in Figure 41-2, the two smooth-muscle layers are arranged as an inner circular layer and an outer longitudinal layer. The myenteric ganglia of the ENS are located between the two muscle layers.

The segments of the GI tract through which food products pass are hollow, low-pressure organs that are separated by specialized circular muscles or sphincters. These sphincters function as barriers to flow by maintaining a positive resting pressure that serves to separate the two adjacent organs, in which lower pressures prevail. Sphincters thus regulate both antegrade (forward) and retrograde (reverse) movement. For example, the resting pressure of the pyloric sphincter controls, in part, the emptying of gastric contents into the duodenum. On the opposite end of the stomach, the resting pressure of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) prevents gastric contents from refluxing back into the esophagus and causing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). As a general rule, stimuli proximal to a sphincter cause sphincteric relaxation, whereas stimuli distal to a sphincter induce sphincteric contraction. Changes in sphincter pressure are coordinated with the smooth-muscle contractions in the organs on either side. This coordination depends on both the intrinsic properties of sphincteric smooth muscle and neurohumoral stimuli.

Sphincters effectively serve as one-way valves. Thus, the act of deglutition (or swallowing) induces relaxation of the

UES, whereas the LES remains contracted. Only when the UES returns to its initial pressure does the LES begin to relax, -3 seconds after the start of deglutition. Disturbances in sphincter activity are often associated with alterations in one or more of these regulatory processes.

## Location of a sphincter determines its function

Six sphincters are present in the GI tract (see Fig. 41-1), each with a different resting pressure and different response to various stimuli. An additional sphincter, the sphincter of Oddi, regulates movement of the contents of the common bile duct into the duodenum.

Upper Esophageal Sphincter Separating the pharynx and the upper part of the esophagus is the UES, which consists of striated muscle and has the highest resting pressure of all the GI sphincters. The swallowing mechanism, which involves the oropharynx and the UES, is largely under the control of the swallowing center in the medulla via cranial nerves V (trigeminal), IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and XII (hypoglossal). Respiration and deglutition are closely integrated (see p. 720).

The UES is closed during inspiration, thereby diverting atmospheric air to the glottis and away from the esophagus. During swallowing, the situation reverses, with closure of the glottis and inhibition of respiration, but with relaxation of the UES (Fig. 41-4). These changes permit the entry of food contents into the esophagus and not into the airways of the respiratory tract.

Lower Esophageal Sphincter The esophagus is separated from the stomach by the LES, which is composed of specialized smooth muscle that is both anatomically and physiologically distinct from adjacent smooth muscle in the distal end of the esophagus and proximal portion of the stomach. The primary functions of the LES are (1) to permit coordinated movement of ingested food into the stomach from the esophagus after swallowing or deglutition, and (2) to prevent reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus. Either deglutition or distention of the esophagus results in a reduction in LES pressure (see Fig. 41-4), thereby permitting entry of food into the stomach. Relaxation of the LES occurs after the UES has already returned to its resting pressure. The LES maintains a resting tone that is the result of both intrinsic myogenic properties of the sphincteric muscle and cholinergic regulation. Relaxation of the LES is mediated both by the vagus nerve and by intrinsic properties of the smooth muscle, including important inhibitory effects by VIP and by NO.

Abnormalities of both resting LES pressure and its relaxation in response to deglutition are often associated with significant symptoms. Thus, a reduced resting LES pressure often results in gastroesophageal reflux, which may cause esophagitis (i.e., inflammation of the esophageal mucosa). A defect in LES relaxation is a major component of a condition called achalasia (Box 41-1), which often results in dilation of the esophagus (megaesophagus) and is associated with difficulty in swallowing (dysphagia).

Swallowing and the function of the UES and LES are closely integrated into the function of the esophagus. Under normal circumstances, esophageal muscle contractions are

The swallowing center in the medulla that initiates deglutition includes the nucleus ambiguus (cranial nerves [CN] IX and X), the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (CN X), and others. Shown are recordings of intraluminal pressures at different sites along the esophagus, from the UES (record 1) to the LES (record 6). The left side of the graph shows the pressures at rest. As shown on the right side, after a dry swallow, the pressure wave of a "primary peristalsis" moves sequentially down the esophagus.

New York, Lippincott-Raven, 1994, pp 903-928.)

## BOX 41-1 Achalasia

Achalasia is a relatively uncommon condition associated with difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) and a dilated esophagus proximal to a narrowed, tapered area at the gastroesophageal junction. The term achalasia is derived from Greek words meaning "absence of relaxation." The distal narrowed area of the esophagus suggests the presence of a stricture. However, it is easy to introduce an esophagoscope into the stomach through the narrowed area. Subsequent studies of esophageal motility in which investigators measured intraesophageal pressure demonstrated the presence of two defects in patients with achalasia: (1) failure of the LES to relax, and (2) impaired peristalsis in the distal two thirds of the body of the esophagus (i.e., the portion that consists of smooth muscle). Peristalsis is intact in the proximal third of the esophagus, which consists of striated muscle. In essence, the smooth-muscle portions of the esophagus behave as a denervated structure. The fundamental defect in achalasia is likely related to selective loss of intramural inhibitory neurons that regulate the LES, the neurotransmitters for which are VIP and NO. Treatment is either physical distention (or stretching) of the LES with a pneumatic-bag dilator or surgical cutting of the LES (i.e., an esophageal Heller myotomy via a laparoscopic approach).

almost exclusively peristaltic and are initiated by swallowing. Deglutition initiates relaxation of the UES and propagated contractions, first of the UES and then of the muscles along the esophagus (see Fig. 41-4). In the meantime, the LES has already relaxed. The result of the advancing peristaltic wave is the caudad propulsion of a bolus toward the stomach.

Distention of the esophagus (in the absence of swallowing) also initiates propulsive esophageal contractions distal to the site of distention, as well as relaxation of the LES. Reflux of gastric contents into the lower part of the esophagus also produces such a local distention, without a swallow, and elicits the same response: peristaltic contractions that clear the esophagus of refluxed gastric material. Peristalsis that is initiated by swallowing is called primary peristalsis, whereas that elicited by distention of the esophagus is referred to as secondary peristalsis. Esophageal contractions after a swallow are regulated by the medullary swallowing center, intramural esophageal plexuses, the vagus nerve, and intrinsic myogenic processes.

Pyloric Sphincter The pylorus is the sphincter that separates the stomach from the duodenum. The pressure of the pyloric sphincter regulates, in part, gastric emptying and prevents duodenal-gastric reflux. However, although a specific pyloric sphincter is present, it is quite short and is a relatively poor barrier (i.e., it can resist only a small pressure gradient). The stomach, duodenum, biliary tract, and pancreas-which are closely related embryologicallyfunction as an integrated unit. Indeed, coordinated contraction and relaxation of the antrum, pylorus, and duodenum (which is sometimes referred to as the antroduodenal cluster unit) are probably more important than simply the pressure produced by the pyloric smooth muscle per se. Regulation of gastric emptying is discussed further on pp. 877-878.

Ileocecal Sphincter The valve-like structure that separates the ileum and cecum is called the ileocecal sphincter. Similar to other GI sphincters, the ileocecal sphincter maintains a positive resting pressure and is under the control of the vagus nerve, sympathetic nerves, and the ENS. Distention of the ileum results in relaxation of the sphincter, whereas distention of the proximal (ascending) colon causes contraction of the ileocecal sphincter. As a consequence, ileal flow into the colon is regulated by luminal contents and pressure, both proximal and distal to the ileocecal sphincter.

Internal and External Anal Sphincters The "anal sphincter" actually consists of both an internal and an external sphincter. The internal sphincter has both circular and longitudinal smooth muscle and is under involuntary control. The external sphincter, which encircles the rectum, contains only striated muscle but is controlled by both voluntary and involuntary mechanisms. The high resting pressure of the overall anal sphincter predominantly reflects the resting tone of the internal anal sphincter. Distention of the rectum (Fig. 41-5A), either by colonic contents (i.e., stool) or experimentally by balloon inflation, initiates the rectosphincteric reflex by relaxing the internal sphincter (see Fig. 41-5B). If defecation is not desired, continence is maintained by an involuntary reflex-orchestrated by the sacral spinal cordthat contracts the external anal sphincter (see Fig. 41-5C). If

defecation is desired, a series of both voluntary and involuntary events occurs that includes relaxation of the external anal sphincter, contraction of abdominal wall muscles, and relaxation of pelvic wall muscles. Flexure of the hips and descent of the pelvic floor then facilitate defecation by minimizing the angle between the rectum and anus. In contrast, if a delay in defecation is needed or desired, voluntary contraction of the external anal sphincter is usually sufficient to override the series of reflexes initiated by rectal distention.

## Motility of the small intestine achieves both churning and propulsive movement, and its temporal pattern differs in the fed and fasted states

Digestion and absorption of dietary nutrients are the primary functions of the small intestine, and the motor activity of the small intestine is closely integrated with its digestive

![bo104869338f](bo104869338f.jpg)

Figure 41-6 Mechanical activity in the fasting and fed states. Shown are records of intraluminal pressure along the small intestine of a conscious dog. Before feeding (left side), the pattern is one of MMCs. Feeding triggers a switch to a different pattern, characterized by both segmental contractions that churn the contents and peristaltic contractions that propel the contents along the small intestine. (Data from Itoh Z, Sekiguchi T: Interdigestive motor activity in health and disease. Scand J Gastroenterol Suppl 82:121-134, 1983.)
and absorptive roles. The two classes of small-intestinal motor activity are churning (or mixing) and propulsion of the bolus of luminal contents. Churning-which is accomplished by segmental, nonpropulsive contractions-mixes the luminal contents with pancreatic, biliary, and smallintestinal secretions, thus enhancing the digestion of dietary nutrients in the lumen. These segmental contractions also decrease the unstirred water layer that is adjacent to the apical membranes of the small-intestine cells, thus promoting absorption. Churning or mixing movements occur following eating and are the result of contractions of circular muscle in segments flanked at either end by receiving segments that relax. Churning, however, does not advance the luminal contents along the small intestine. In contrast, propulsion-which is accomplished by propagated, peristaltic contractions-results in caudad movement of the intestinal luminal contents, either for absorption at more distal sites of the small or large intestine or for elimination in stool. Peristaltic propulsion occurs as a result of contraction of the circular muscle and relaxation of the longitudinal muscle in the propulsive or upstream segment, together with relaxation of the circular muscle and contraction of the longitudinal muscle in the downstream receiving segment. Thus, circular smooth muscle in the small intestine participates in both churning and propulsion.

The $V_{m}$ changes of intestinal smooth-muscle cells consist of both action potentials (see p. 244) and slow-wave activity (see p. 244). The patterns of electrical and mechanical activ-
ity differ in the fasting and fed states. In the fasting state, the small intestine is relatively quiescent but exhibits synchronized, rhythmic changes in both electrical and motor activity (Fig. 41-6). The interdigestive myoelectric or migrating motor complex (MMC) is the term used to describe these rhythmic contractions of the small intestine that are observed in the fasting state. MMCs in humans occur at intervals of 90 to 120 minutes and consist of four distinct phases: (1) a prolonged quiescent period, (2) a period of increasing action potential frequency and contractility, (3) a period of peak electrical and mechanical activity that lasts a few minutes, and (4) a period of declining activity that merges into the next quiescent period. During the interdigestive period, particles $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter can pass from the stomach into the duodenum, which permits emptying of ingested material from the stomach (e.g., bones, coins) that could not be reduced in size to $<2 \mathrm{~mm}$. The slow propulsive contractions that characterize phases 2 to 4 of the MMCs clear the small intestine of its residual content, including undigested food, bacteria, desquamated cells, and intestinal and pancreatic biliary secretions. MMCs usually originate in the stomach and often travel to the distal end of the ileum, but $\sim 25 \%$ are initiated in the duodenum and proximal part of the jejunum.

Feeding terminates MMCs and initiates the appearance of the fed motor pattern (see Fig. 41-6). The latter is less well characterized than MMCs but, as noted above, consists of both segmental contractions (churning), which enhance

digestion and absorption, and peristaltic contractions (propulsion).

Determination of the primary factors that regulate both MMCs and transition to the fed pattern has been hampered by both species differences and complex interactions among the multiple probable mediators. Nonetheless, clear evidence has been presented for a role of the ENS, one or more humoral factors, and extrinsic innervation. A major determinant of the MMC pattern is the hormone motilin, a 22-amino-acid peptide that is synthesized in the duodenal mucosa and released just before the initiation of phase 3 of the MMC cycle. Motilin does not appear to have a role in the motor pattern that is observed in the fed state. Factors important in induction of the fed pattern include the activity of the vagus nerve (because sham feeding also both terminates MMCs and initiates a fed pattern) as well as the caloric content and type of food (e.g., fat more than protein) in the meal.

## Motility of the large intestine achieves both propulsive movement and a reservoir function

The human large intestine has four primary functions. First, the colon absorbs large quantities of fluid and electrolytes and converts the liquid content of ileocecal material to solid or semisolid stool. Second, the colon avidly absorbs the short-chain fatty acids formed by the catabolism (or fermentation) of dietary carbohydrates that are not absorbed in the small intestine. The abundant colonic microflora accomplish this fermentation. Third, the storage of colonic content represents a reservoir function of the large intestine. Fourth, the colon eliminates its contents in a regulated and controlled fashion, largely under voluntary control. To accomplish these important activities, the large intestine functionally acts as two distinct organs. The proximal (or ascending and transverse) part of the colon is the site where most of the fluid and electrolyte absorption occurs and where bacterial fermentation takes place. The distal (or descending and rectosigmoid) portion of the colon provides final desiccation, as well as reservoir function, and serves as a storage organ for colonic material before defecation.

In contrast to the motor pattern in the small intestine, no distinct fasting and fed patterns of contractions are seen in the colon. Similarly to small-intestinal motor activity, colonic contractions are regulated by myogenic, neurogenic, and hormonal factors. Parasympathetic control of the proximal two thirds of the colon is mediated by the vagus nerve, whereas parasympathetic control of the descending and rectosigmoid colon is mediated by pelvic nerves originating from the sacral spinal cord.

The proximal colon has two types of motor activity, nonpropulsive segmentation and mass peristalsis. Nonpropulsive "segmentation" is generated by slow-wave activity that produces circular-muscle contractions that churn the colonic contents and move them in an orad direction (i.e., toward the cecum). The segmental contractions that produce the churning give the colon its typical appearance of segments or haustra (see Fig. 41-1). During this mixing phase, material is retained in the proximal portion of the large intestine for

## BOX 41-2 Hirschsprung Disease

The anal sphincter controls defecation and consists of a smooth-muscle internal sphincter and a striated-muscle external sphincter. Distention of the rectum by inflation of a balloon-which simulates the effect of the presence of solid feces in the rectum-results in relaxation of the internal sphincter and contraction of the external sphincter (see Fig. 41-5). Voluntary control of the external sphincter regulates the timing of defecation.

Hirschsprung disease is a congenital polygenic disorder. At least 11 genes ( $\mathbf{N 4 1 - 3}$ have been associated with Hirschsprung disease (http://www.emedicine.com/radio/ topic343.htm. Accessed Sept 2014), including mutations in the RET receptor (a receptor tyrosine kinase) and its ligand. Variable penetrance leads to variable manifestations of the disease. At the cellular level, the fundamental defect is arrest of the caudad migration of neural crest cells, which are the precursors of ganglion cells. Symptoms include constipation, megacolon, and a narrowed segment of colon in the rectum. Histological examination of this narrowed segment reveals an absence of ganglion cells from both the submucosal and myenteric plexuses (see Fig. 41-3A). The patient's constipation and resulting megacolon are secondary to failure of this "aganglionic" segment to relax in response to proximal distention. Manometric assessment of the internal and external anal sphincters reveals that the smooth-muscle internal sphincter does not relax after rectal distention (see Fig. 41-5) but that the external anal sphincter functions normally. Treatment of this condition is usually surgical, with removal of the narrowed segment that is missing the ganglia that normally regulate relaxation of the smooth muscle of the internal anal sphincter.
relatively long periods, and fluid and electrolyte absorption continues. One to three times a day, a so-called mass peristalsis occurs in which a portion of the colonic contents is propelled distally 20 cm or more. Such mass peristaltic contractions are the primary form of propulsive motility in the colon and may be initiated by eating. During mass peristalsis, the haustra disappear; they reappear after the completion of mass peristalsis.

In the distal colon, the primary motor activity is nonpropulsive segmentation that is produced by annular or segmental contractions. It is in the distal part of the colon that the final desiccation of colonic contents occurs. It is also here that these contents are stored before an occasional mass peristalsis that propels them into the rectum. The rectum itself is kept nearly empty by nonpropulsive segmentation until it is filled by mass peristalsis of the distal end of the colon. As described in Figure 41-5, filling of the rectum triggers a series of reflexes in the internal and external anal sphincters that lead to defecation (Box 41-2).

# GASTRIC FUNCTION 

Henry J. Binder

The stomach plays several important roles in human nutrition and has secretory, motor, and humoral functions. These activities are not separate and distinct, but rather represent integrated functions that are required to initiate the normal digestive process.

The stomach has several specific secretory products. In addition to the stomach's best-known product, acid, these products include pepsinogen, mucus, bicarbonate, intrinsic factor, and water. These substances continue the food digestion that was initiated by mastication and the action of salivary enzymes in the mouth. In addition, they help protect the stomach from injury. The stomach also has several important motor functions that regulate the intake of food, its mixing with gastric secretions and reduction in particle size, and the exit of partially digested material into the duodenum. Moreover, the stomach produces two important humoral agents-gastrin and somatostatinthat have both endocrine and paracrine actions. These peptides are primarily important in the regulation of gastric secretion.

Although these functions are important in the maintenance of good health, the stomach is nevertheless not required for survival. Individuals who have had their entire stomach removed (i.e., total gastrectomy) for non-neoplastic reasons can maintain adequate nutrition and achieve excellent longevity.

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE STOMACH

## The mucosa is composed of surface epithelial cells and glands

The basic structure of the stomach wall is similar to that of other regions of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract (see Fig. 41-2); therefore, the wall of the stomach consists of both mucosal and muscle layers. The stomach can be divided, based on its gross anatomy, into three major segments (Fig. 42-1): (1) A specialized portion of the stomach called the cardia is located just distal to the gastroesophageal junction and is devoid of the acid-secreting parietal cells. (2) The body or corpus is the largest portion of the stomach; its most proximal region is called the fundus. (3) The distal portion of the stomach is called the antrum. The surface area of the gastric mucosa is substantially increased by the presence of gastric glands, which consist of a pit, a neck, and a base. These
glands contain several cell types, including mucous, parietal, chief, and endocrine cells; endocrine cells also are present in both corpus and antrum. The surface epithelial cells, which have their own distinct structure and function, secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and mucus.

Marked cellular heterogeneity exists not only within segments (e.g., glands versus surface epithelial cells) but also between segments of the stomach. For instance, as discussed below, the structure and function of the mucosal epithelial cells in the antrum and body are quite distinct. Likewise, although the smooth muscle in the proximal and distal portions of the stomach appear structurally similar, their functions and pharmacological properties differ substantially.

## With increasing rates of secretion of gastric juice, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration rises and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration falls

The glands of the stomach typically secrete $\sim 2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of a fluid that is approximately isotonic with blood plasma. As a consequence of the heterogeneity of gastric mucosal function, early investigators recognized that gastric secretion consists of two distinct components: parietal-cell and nonparietal-cell secretion. Accordingly, gastric secretion consists of (1) an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-rich basal secretion that originates from nonparietal cells, and (2) a stimulated component that represents a pure parietal-cell secretion that is rich in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. This model helps to explain the inverse relationship between the luminal concentrations of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$as a function of the rate of gastric secretion (Fig. 42-2). Thus, at high rates of gastric secretion-for example, when gastrin or histamine stimulates parietal cells-intraluminal $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is high whereas intraluminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is relatively low. At low rates of secretion or in clinical situations in which maximal acid secretion is reduced (e.g., pernicious anemia ( $\mathrm{Na} 2-1$ ), intraluminal $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is low but intraluminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is high.

The proximal portion of the stomach secretes acid, pepsinogens, intrinsic factor, bicarbonate, and mucus, whereas the distal part releases gastrin and somatostatin

Corpus The primary secretory products of the proximal part of the stomach-acid (protons), pepsinogens, and intrinsic factor-are made by distinct cells in glands of the

# N42-1 Pernicious Anemia 

## Contributed by Henry Binder

The close relationship between acid and gastrin release is clearly manifested in individuals with impaired acid secretion. In pernicious anemia, atrophy of the gastric mucosa in the corpus and an absence of parietal cells result in a lack in the secretion of both gastric acid and intrinsic factor (IF). Many patients with pernicious anemia exhibit antibody-mediated immunity against their parietal cells, and many of these patients also produce anti-IF autoantibodies.

Because IF is required for cobalamin absorption in the ileum, the result is impaired cobalamin absorption. In contrast, the antrum is normal. Moreover, plasma gastrin levels are markedly elevated as a result of the absence of intraluminal acid, which normally triggers gastric D cells to release somatostatin (see pp. 868-870); this, in turn, inhibits antral gastrin release (see Box 42-1). Because parietal cells are absent, the elevated plasma gastrin levels are not associated with enhanced gastric acid secretion.

The clinical complications of cobalamin deficiency evolve over a period of years. Patients develop megaloblastic anemia (in which the circulating red blood cells are enlarged), a distinctive form of glossitis, and a neuropathy. The earliest neurological findings are those of peripheral neuropathy, as manifested by paresthesias and slow reflexes, as well as impaired senses of touch, vibration, and temperature. If untreated, the disease will ultimately involve the spinal cord, particularly the dorsal columns, thus producing weakness and ataxia. Memory impairment, depression, and dementia can also result. Parenteral administration of cobalamin reverses and prevents the manifestations of pernicious anemia, but it does not influence parietal cells or restore gastric secretion of either IF or intraluminal acid.

corpus. The two primary cell types in the gastric glands of the body of the stomach are parietal cells and chief cells.

Parietal cells (or oxyntic cells) secrete both acid and intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein that is required for cobalamin (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ ) absorption in the ileum (see pp. 935-937). The parietal cell has a very distinctive morphology (see Fig. 42-1). It is a large triangular cell with a centrally located nucleus, an abundance of mitochondria, intracellular tubulovesicular membranes, and canalicular structures. We discuss $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion in the next subchapter and intrinsic factor on page 937.

Chief cells (or peptic cells) secrete pepsinogens, but not acid. These epithelial cells are substantially smaller than parietal cells. A close relationship exists among pH , pepsin secretion, and function. Pepsins are endopeptidases (i.e., they hydrolyze "interior" peptide bonds) and initiate protein digestion by hydrolyzing specific peptide linkages. The basal luminal pH of the stomach is 4 to 6 ; with stimulation, the pH of gastric secretions is usually reduced to $<2$. At pH

values that are $<3$, pepsinogens are rapidly activated to pepsins. A low gastric pH also helps to prevent bacterial colonization of the small intestine. ( $\mathrm{N} 42-2$

In addition to parietal and chief cells, glands from the corpus of the stomach also contain mucus-secreting cells, which are confined to the neck of the gland (see Fig. 42-1), and five or six endocrine cells. Among these endocrine cells are enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells, which release histamine.

Antrum The glands in the antrum of the stomach do not contain parietal cells. Therefore, the antrum does not secrete either acid or intrinsic factor. Glands in the antral mucosa contain chief cells and endocrine cells; the endocrine cells include the so-called G cells and D cells, which secrete gastrin and somatostatin, respectively (see Table 41-1). These two peptide hormones function as both endocrine and paracrine regulators of acid secretion. As discussed in more detail below, gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion by two mechanisms and is also a major trophic or growth factor for GI epithelial-cell proliferation. As discussed more fully below, somatostatin also has several important regulatory functions, but its primary role in gastric physiology is to inhibit both gastrin release and parietal-cell acid secretion.

In addition to the cells of the gastric glands, the stomach also contains superficial epithelial cells that cover the gastric pits as well as the surface in between the pits. These cells secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

## The stomach accommodates food, mixes it with gastric secretions, grinds it, and empties the chyme into the duodenum

In addition to its secretory properties, the stomach also has multiple motor functions. These functions are the result of gastric smooth-muscle activity, which is integrated by both neural and hormonal signals. Gastric motor functions include both propulsive and retrograde movement of food and liquid, as well as a nonpropulsive movement that increases intragastric pressure.

Similar to the heterogeneity of gastric epithelial cells, considerable diversity is seen in both the regulation and contractility of gastric smooth muscle. The stomach has at least two distinct areas of motor activity; the proximal and distal portions of the stomach behave as separate, but coordinated, entities. At least four events can be identified in the overall process of gastric filling and emptying: (1) receiving and providing temporary storage of dietary food and liquids; (2) mixing food and water with gastric secretory products, including pepsin and acid; (3) grinding food so that particle size is reduced to enhance digestion and to permit passage through the pylorus; and (4) regulating the exit of retained material from the stomach into the duodenum (i.e., gastric emptying of chyme) in response to various stimuli.

The mechanisms by which the stomach receives and empties liquids and solids are significantly different. Emptying of liquids is primarily a function of the smooth muscle of the proximal part of the stomach, whereas emptying of solids is regulated by antral smooth muscle.

## ACID SECRETION

## The parietal cell has a specialized tubulovesicular structure that increases apical membrane area when the cell is stimulated to secrete acid

In the basal state, the rate of acid secretion is low. Tubulovesicular membranes are present in the apical portion of the resting, nonstimulated parietal cell and contain the $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (or $\mathrm{H}, \mathrm{K}$-ATPase) that is responsible for acid secretion. Upon stimulation, cytoskeletal rearrangement causes the tubulovesicular membranes that contain the $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump to fuse into the canalicular membrane (Fig. 42-3). The result is a substantial increase ( 50 - to 100 -fold) in the surface area of the apical membrane of the parietal cell, as well as the appearance of microvilli. This fusion is accompanied by insertion of the $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps, as well as $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, into the canalicular membrane. The large number of mitochondria in the parietal cell is consistent with the high rate of glucose oxidation and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption that is needed to support acid secretion.

## An H-K pump is responsible for gastric acid secretion by parietal cells

The parietal-cell H-K pump is a member of the gene family of P-type ATPases (see pp. 117-118) that includes the ubiquitous Na-K pump ( $\mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{K}$-ATPase), which is present at the basolateral membrane of virtually all mammalian epithelial cells and at the plasma membrane of nonpolarized cells. Similar to other members of this ATPase family, the parietalcell $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump requires both an $\alpha$ subunit and a $\beta$ subunit for full activity. The catalytic function of the H-K pump resides in the $\alpha$ subunit; however, the $\beta$ subunit is required for targeting to the apical membrane.

The activity of these P-type ATPases, including the gastric $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, is affected by inhibitors that are clinically important in the control of gastric acid secretion. The two types of gastric H-K pump inhibitors are (1) substituted benzimidazoles (e.g., omeprazole), which act by binding covalently to cysteines on the extracytoplasmic surface; and (2) substances that act as competitive inhibitors of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-binding site (e.g.,

## N42-2 Gastric pH and Pneumonia

## Contributed by Henry Binder

Many patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) receive prophylactic anti-ulcer treatments (e.g., proton pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole) that inhibit proton secretion and thereby raise gastric pH . Patients in the ICU who are mechanically ventilated or who have coagulopathies are highly susceptible to hemorrhage from gastric stress ulcers, a complication that can contribute significantly to overall morbidity and mortality. These different anti-ulcer regimens do effectively lessen the risk of developing stress ulcers. However, by raising gastric pH , these agents also lower the barrier to gramnegative bacterial colonization of the stomach. Esophageal reflux and subsequent aspiration of these organisms are common in these very sick patients, many of whom are already immunocompromised or even mechanically compromised by the presence of a ventilator tube. If these bacteria are aspirated into the airway, pneumonia can result. The higher the gastric pH , the greater the risk of pneumonia.

## N42-3 Gastric H-K Pump

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$ subunit of the parietal-cell H-K pump has 1033 amino acids and 10 membrane-spanning segments. It is $\sim 65 \%$ identical to the $\alpha$ subunit of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump.

The $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ subunit, which consists of 290 amino acids, has only one membrane-spanning segment; it is $35 \%$ to $40 \%$ identical to the $\beta$ subunit of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The two subunits form a heterodimer with close interaction at the extracellular domain.

## BOX 42-1 Gastrinoma or Zollinger-Ellison Syndrome

Orare occasions, patients with one or more ulcers have very high rates of gastric acid secretion. The increased acid secretion in these patients is most often a result of elevated levels of serum gastrin, released from a pancreatic islet cell adenoma or gastrinoma (Table 42-1). This clinical picture is also known as Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) syndrome. Because gastrin released from these islet cell adenomas is not under physiological control, but rather is continuously released, acid secretion is substantially increased under basal conditions. However, the intravenous administration of pentagastrin-a synthetic gastrin consisting of the last four amino acids of gastrin plus $\beta$-alanine-produces only a modest increase in gastric acid secretion. Omeprazole, a potent inhibitor of the parietal-cell H-K pump, is now an effective therapeutic agent to control the marked enhancement of gastric acid secretion in patients with gastrinoma and thus helps to heal their duodenal and gastric ulcers.

In contrast to patients with gastrinoma or ZE syndrome, other patients with duodenal ulcer have serum gastrin levels that are near normal. Their basal acid-secretion rates are modestly elevated but increase markedly in response to pentagastrin.

Patients with pernicious anemia ( $\mathbf{O}$ N42-1 lack parietal cells and thus cannot secrete the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$necessary to stimulate the antral D cell (see Fig. 42-8). Consequently, the release of somatostatin from the D cell is low, which results in minimal tonic inhibition of gastrin release from G cells. Thus, these patients have very high levels of serum gastrin, but virtually no $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion (see Table 42-1).

the experimental drug Schering 28080). Omeprazole is a potent inhibitor of parietal-cell H-K pump activity and is an extremely effective drug in the control of gastric acid secretion in both normal subjects and patients with hypersecretory states (Box 42-1). In addition, H-K pump inhibitors have been useful in furthering understanding of the function of these pumps. Thus, ouabain, a potent inhibitor of the Na-K pump, does not inhibit the gastric H-K pump, whereas omeprazole does not inhibit the Na-K pump. The colonic $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, whose $\alpha$ subunit has an amino-acid sequence that is similar but not identical to that of both the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and the parietal-cell H-K pump, is partially inhibited by ouabain but not by omeprazole.

The key step in gastric acid secretion is extrusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the lumen of the gastric gland in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$
![bo144869338f](bo144869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-4 Acid secretion by parietal cells. When the parietal cell is stimulated, H-K pumps extrude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the lumen of the gastric gland in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycles back into the lumen via $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) provides the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$extruded by the H-K pump, as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exits via the basolateral anion exchanger (AE2). $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$enters across basolateral membrane via AE2, Na/K/Cl cotransporter NKCC1, and the electrogenic SLC26A7; $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exits through apical CFTR (and perhaps CIC) channels.
(Fig. 42-4). The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$taken up into the parietal cells is recycled to the lumen through $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The final component of the process is passive movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the gland lumen. The net result is the secretion of HCl . Secretion of acid across the apical membrane by the $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{K}$ pump results in a rise in parietal-cell pH . The adaptive response to this rise in pH includes passive uptake of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, which the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (see p. 630) converts to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is the substrate of the H-K pump. The $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ exits across the basolateral membrane via a $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (AE2 or SLC4A2), which also provides some of the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$required for net HCl movement across the apical/ canalicular membrane. The basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger may participate in intracellular pH regulation, especially in the basal state.

## Three secretagogues (acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine) directly and indirectly induce acid secretion by parietal cells

The action of secretagogues on gastric acid secretion occurs via at least two parallel and perhaps redundant mechanisms (Fig. 42-5). In the first, acetylcholine ( ACh ), gastrin, and histamine bind directly to their respective receptors on the parietal-cell membrane and synergistically stimulate acid secretion. ACh (see Fig. 14-8) is released from endings of the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X ), and as we will see below, gastrin is released from G cells. Histamine is synthesized from histidine in ECL cells of the lamina propria (see Fig. 13-8B). In the second mechanism, ACh and gastrin indirectly induce acid secretion as a result of their stimulation of histamine release from ECL cells.

![bo154869338f](bo154869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-5 Direct and indirect actions of the three acid secretagogues: ACh, gastrin, and histamine.
![bo164869338f](bo164869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-6 Receptors and signal-transduction pathways in the parietal cell. The parietal cell has separate receptors for three acid secretagogues. ACh and gastrin each bind to specific receptors ( $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$, respectively) coupled to the G protein $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$. The result is activation of PLC, which ultimately leads to the activation of PKC and the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. The histamine binds to an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor, coupled through $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ to adenylyl cyclase (AC). The result is production of cAMP and activation of PKA. Two inhibitors of acid secretion, somatostatin and prostaglandins, bind to separate receptors coupled to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

## The three acid secretagogues act through either $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ /diacylglycerol or cAMP

Stimulation of acid secretion by ACh, gastrin, and histamine is mediated by a series of intracellular signal-transduction processes similar to those responsible for the action of other agonists in other cell systems. All three secretagogues bind to specific G protein-coupled receptors on the parietal-cell membrane (Fig. 42-6).

ACh binds to an $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ muscarinic receptor (see pp. 341-342) on the parietal-cell basolateral membrane. This ACh receptor couples to a GTP-binding protein $\left(\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}\right)$ and activates phospholipase C (PLC), which converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate ( $\mathrm{PIP}_{2}$ ) to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG; see p. 58). $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ causes internal stores to release $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, which then probably acts via calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (see p. 60). DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). The $\mathrm{M}_{2}$ receptor also activates a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel.

Gastrin binds to a specific parietal-cell receptor that has been identified as the gastrin-cholecystokinin type $2\left(\mathrm{CCK}_{2}\right)$ receptor. Two related CCK receptors have been identified, $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$. Their amino-acid sequences are $\sim 50 \%$ identical, and both are G protein coupled. The $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$ receptor has equal affinity for both gastrin and CCK. In contrast, the $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptor's affinity for CCK is three orders of magnitude higher than its affinity for gastrin. These observations and the availability of receptor antagonists are beginning to clarify the parallel, but at times opposite, effects of gastrin and CCK on various aspects of GI function. The $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$ receptor couples to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$ and activates the same PLC pathway as does ACh; this process leads to both an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and activation of PKC.

The histamine receptor on the parietal cell is an $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor that is coupled to the $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ GTP-binding protein. Histamine activation of the receptor complex stimulates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase, which, in turn, generates cAMP. The resulting activation of protein kinase A leads to the phosphorylation of certain parietal-cell proteins, including the H-K pump.

## Antral and duodenal G cells release gastrin, whereas ECL cells in the corpus release histamine

The presence of a gastric hormone that stimulates acid secretion was initially proposed in 1905. Direct evidence of such a factor was obtained in 1938, and in 1964 Gregory and Tracey isolated and purified gastrin and determined its

![bo174869338f](bo174869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-7 A, A single gene encodes a 101-amino-acid peptide that is processed to both G-17 ("little gastrin") and G-34 ("big gastrin"). The N-terminal glutamine is modified to create a pyroglutamyl residue. The C-terminal phenylalanine is amidated. These modifications make the hormone resistant to carboxy- and aminopeptidases. B, The final 16 amino acids of G-34 are identical to the final 16 amino acids in G-17. Both G-17 and G-34 may be either not sulfated (gastrin I) or sulfated (gastrin II). C, The five final amino acids of CCK are identical to those of G-17 and G-34.
amino-acid sequence. Gastrin has three major effects on GI cells: (1) stimulation of acid secretion by parietal cells (see Fig. 42-5), (2) release of histamine by ECL cells, and (3) regulation of mucosal growth in the corpus of the stomach, as well as in the small and large intestine.

Gastrin exists in several different forms, but the two major forms are G-17, or "little gastrin," a 17-amino-acid linear peptide (Fig. 42-7A), and G-34, or "big gastrin," a 34-aminoacid peptide (see Fig. 42-7B). A single gene encodes a peptide of 101 amino acids. Several cleavage steps and C-terminal amidation (i.e., addition of an $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ to the C terminus) take place during gastrin's post-translational modification, a process that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum, transGolgi apparatus, and both immature and mature secretory granules. The final product of this post-translational modification is either G-17 or G-34. The tyrosine residue may be either sulfated (so-called gastrin II) or nonsulfated (gastrin I); the two forms are equally active and are present in equal amounts. Gastrin and CCK, a related hormone, have identical C-terminal tetrapeptide sequences (see Fig. 42-7C) that possess all the biological activities of both gastrin and CCK. Both G-17 and G-34 are present in blood plasma, and their plasma levels primarily reflect their degradation rates. Thus, although G-17 is more active than G-34, the latter is degraded at a substantially lower rate than G-17. As a consequence, the infusion of an equal amount of G-17 or G-34 produces comparable increases in gastric acid secretion.

Specialized endocrine cells in both the antrum and duodenum make each of the two gastrins. Antral G cells are the primary source of G-17, whereas duodenal G cells are the primary source of G-34. Antral G cells are unusual in that they respond to both luminal and basolateral stimuli (Fig. 42-8). Antral G cells have microvilli on their apical membrane surface and are referred to as an open-type endocrine cell. These G cells release gastrin in response to luminal peptides and amino acids, as well as in response to gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), a 27-amino-acid peptide that is released by vagal nerve endings. As discussed below, gastrin release is inhibited by somatostatin, which is released from adjacent D cells.

ECL cells in the corpus of the stomach synthesize histamine. The central role of histamine and ECL cells is consistent with the observation that $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptor antagonists (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers), such as cimetidine and ranitidine, not only block the direct action of histamine on parietal cells but also substantially inhibit the acid secretion stimulated by ACh and gastrin (which activate ECL cells). The effectiveness of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ blockers in controlling acid secretion after stimulation by most agonists is well established in humans.

## Gastric D cells release somatostatin, the central inhibitor of acid secretion

Gastric acid secretion is under close control of not only the stimulatory pathways discussed above but also the inhibitory pathways. The major inhibitory pathway involves the release of somatostatin, a polypeptide hormone made by D cells in the antrum and corpus of the stomach. Somatostatin is also made by the $\delta$ cells of the pancreatic islets (see p. 1035) and by neurons in the hypothalamus (see pp. 993-994). Somatostatin exists in two forms, SS-28 and SS-14, which have identical C termini. SS-28 is the predominant form in the GI tract.

Somatostatin inhibits gastric acid secretion by both direct and indirect mechanisms (see Fig. 42-8). In the direct pathway, somatostatin coming from two different sources binds to a $\mathrm{Gt} \alpha_{1}$-coupled receptor (SST) on the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell and inhibits adenylyl cyclase. The net effect is to antagonize the stimulatory effect of histamine and thus inhibit gastric acid secretion by parietal cells. The source of this somatostatin can be either paracrine (i.e., D cells present in the corpus of the stomach, near the parietal cells) or endocrine (i.e., D cells in the antrum). However, there is a major difference in what triggers the D

![bo184869338f](bo184869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-8 Regulation of gastric acid secretion. In the corpus of the stomach, the vagus nerve not only stimulates the parietal cell directly by releasing ACh, it also stimulates both ECL and D cells. Vagal stimulation of the ECL cells enhances gastric acid secretion via increased histamine release. Vagal stimulation of the D cells also promotes gastric acid secretion by inhibiting the release of somatostatin, which would otherwise inhibit-by paracrine mechanisms-the release of histamine from ECL cells and the secretion of acid by parietal cells. In the antrum of the stomach, the vagus nerve stimulates both G cells and D cells. The vagus stimulates the G cells via GRP, promoting gastrin release. This gastrin promotes gastric acid secretion by two endocrine mechanisms: directly via the parietal cell and indirectly via the ECL cell, which releases histamine. The vagal stimulation of D cells via ACh inhibits the release of somatostatin, which would otherwise inhibit-by paracrine mechanisms-the release of gastrin from G cells and-by an endocrine mechanism—acid secretion by parietal cells. Luminal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$directly stimulates the D cells to release somatostatin, which inhibits gastrin release from the G cells, thereby reducing gastric acid secretion (negative feedback). In addition, products of protein digestion (i.e., peptides and amino acids) directly stimulate the G cells to release gastrin, which stimulates gastric acid secretion (positive feedback).

cells in the corpus and in the antrum. Neural and hormonal mechanisms stimulate D cells in the corpus (which cannot sense intraluminal pH ), whereas low intraluminal pH stimulates D cells in the antrum.

Somatostatin also acts via two indirect pathways, both of which are paracrine. In the corpus of the stomach, D cells release somatostatin, which inhibits the release of histamine from ECL cells (see Fig. 42-8). Because histamine is an acid secretagogue, somatostatin thus reduces gastric acid secretion. In the antrum of the stomach, D cells release somatostatin, which inhibits the release of gastrin from G cells. Because gastrin is another acid secretagogue, somatostatin also reduces gastric acid secretion by this route. The gastrin released by the G cell feeds back on itself by stimulating D cells to release the inhibitory somatostatin.

The presence of multiple mechanisms by which somatostatin inhibits acid secretion is another example of the redundant regulatory pathways that control acid secretion. An understanding of the regulation of somatostatin release from D cells is slowly evolving, but it appears that gastrin stimulates somatostatin release, whereas cholinergic agonists inhibit somatostatin release.

## Several enteric hormones ("enterogastrone") and prostaglandins inhibit gastric acid secretion

Multiple processes in the duodenum and jejunum participate in the negative-feedback mechanisms that inhibit gastric acid secretion. Fat, acid, and hyperosmolar solutions in the duodenum are potent inhibitors of gastric acid secretion. Of these inhibitors, lipids are the most potent, but acid is also quite important. Several candidate hormones have been suggested as mediators of this acid inhibition (Table 42-2). These include CCK, secretin (see p. 889), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; see Fig. 13-9), gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), neurotensin (see Fig. 13-9), and peptide YY (see p. 892). Although each inhibits acid secretion after systemic administration, none has been unequivocally established as the sole physiological "enterogastrone."

Evidence suggests that secretin, which is released by duodenal S cells, may have a prime role in inhibiting gastric acid secretion after the entry of fat and acid into the duodenum. Secretin appears to reduce acid secretion by at least three mechanisms: (1) inhibition of antral gastrin release, (2) stim-

ulation of somatostatin release, and (3) direct downregulation of the parietal-cell $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretory process.

The presence of luminal fatty acids causes enteroendocrine cells in the duodenum and the proximal part of the small intestine to release both GIP and CCK. GIP reduces acid secretion directly by inhibiting parietal-cell acid secretion and indirectly by inhibiting the antral release of gastrin. GIP also has the important function of stimulating insulin release from pancreatic islet cells in response to duodenal glucose and fatty acids and is therefore often referred to as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (see p. 1041). CCK participates in feedback inhibition of acid secretion by directly reducing parietal-cell acid secretion. Finally, some evidence indicates that a neural reflex elicited in the duodenum in response to acid also inhibits gastric acid secretion.

Prostaglandin $\mathbf{E}_{2}\left(\mathbf{P G E}_{2}\right)$ inhibits parietal-cell acid secretion, probably by inhibiting histamine's activation of parietalcell function at a site that is distal to the histamine receptor. $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ appears to bind to an $\mathrm{EP}_{1}$ receptor on the basolateral membrane of the parietal cell (see Fig. 42-6) and stimulates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{i}}$, which, in turn, inhibits adenylyl cyclase. In addition, prostaglandins also indirectly inhibit gastric acid secretion by reducing histamine release from ECL cells and gastrin release from antral G cells.

## A meal triggers three phases of acid secretion

Basal State Gastric acid secretion occurs throughout the day and night. Substantial increases in acid secretion occur after meals, whereas the rate of acid secretion between meals is low (i.e., the interdigestive phase). This interdigestive period follows a circadian rhythm; acid secretion is lowest in the morning before awakening and is highest in the evening. Acid secretion is a direct function of the number of parietal cells, which is also influenced, at least in part, by body weight. Thus, men have higher rates of basal acid secretion than do women. Considerable variability in basal acid secretion is also seen among normal individuals, and the resting intragastric pH can range from 3 to 7 (see Box 42-1).

In contrast to the low rate of acid secretion during the basal or interdigestive period, acid secretion is enhanced several-fold by eating (Fig. 42-9). Regulation of gastric acid secretion is most often studied in the fasting state, a state in which intragastric pH is relatively low because of the basal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretory rate and the absence of food that would otherwise buffer the secreted gastric acid. Experimental administration of a secretagogue in the fasted state thus stimulates parietal cells and further lowers intragastric pH . However, the time course of intragastric pH after a meal can vary considerably despite stimulation of acid secretion. The reason is that intragastric pH depends not only on gastric acid secretion but also on the buffering power (see p. 629) of food and the rate of gastric emptying of both acid and partially digested material into the duodenum.

Regulation of acid secretion during a meal can be best characterized as including three separate but interrelated phases: the cephalic, the gastric, and the intestinal phases. The cephalic and gastric phases are of primary importance. Regulation of acid secretion includes both the stimulatory and inhibitory mechanisms that we discussed above (see Fig. 42-8). ACh, gastrin, and histamine all promote

However, as the food leaves the stomach and as the rate of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion increases, $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$slowly rises to its "interdigestive" level.
acid secretion, whereas somatostatin inhibits gastric acid secretion.

Although dividing acid secretion during a meal into three phases has been used for decades, it is somewhat artificial because of considerable overlap in the regulation of acid secretion. For example, the vagus nerve is the central factor in the cephalic phase, but it is also important for the vagovagal reflex that is part of the gastric phase. Similarly, gastrin release is a major component of the gastric phase, but vagal stimulation during the cephalic phase also induces the release of antral gastrin. Finally, the development of a consensus model has long been hampered by considerable differences in regulation of the gastric phase of acid secretion in humans, dogs, and rodents.

Cephalic Phase The smell, sight, taste, thought, and swallowing of food initiate the cephalic phase, which is primarily mediated by the vagus nerve (see Fig. 42-8). Although the cephalic phase has long been studied in experimental animals, especially in dogs by Pavlov, 3 N42-4 more recent studies of sham feeding have confirmed and extended the understanding of the mechanism of the cephalic phase of acid secretion in humans. The aforementioned sensory stimuli activate the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve in the medulla (see p. 339) and thus excite parasympathetic preganglionic efferent nerves. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia also stimulates the vagus nerve and in so doing promotes acid secretion.

Stimulation of the vagus nerve results in four distinct physiological events (already introduced in Fig. 42-8) that together result in enhanced gastric acid secretion. First, in the body of the stomach, vagal postganglionic muscarinic nerves release ACh, which stimulates parietal-cell $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion directly. Second, in the lamina propria of the body of the stomach, the ACh released from vagal endings triggers histamine release from ECL cells, which stimulates acid secretion. Third, in the antrum, peptidergic postganglionic
parasympathetic vagal neurons, as well as other enteric nervous system (ENS) neurons, release GRP, which induces gastrin release from antral G cells. This gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion both directly by acting on parietal cells and indirectly by promoting histamine release from ECL cells. Fourth, in both the antrum and the corpus, the vagus nerve inhibits D cells, thereby reducing their release of somatostatin and reducing the background inhibition of gastrin release. Thus, the cephalic phase stimulates acid secretion directly and indirectly by acting on the parietal cell. The cephalic phase accounts for $\sim 30 \%$ of total acid secretion and occurs before the entry of any food into the stomach.

One of the surgical approaches for the treatment of peptic ulcer disease is cutting the vagus nerves (vagotomy) to inhibit gastric acid secretion. Rarely performed, largely because of the many effective pharmacological agents available to treat peptic ulcer disease, the technique has nevertheless proved effective in selected cases. Because vagal stimulation affects several GI functions besides parietal-cell acid secretion, the side effects of vagotomy include a delay in gastric emptying and diarrhea. Selective vagotomiessevering only those vagal fibers leading to the parietal cellminimize these untoward events.

Gastric Phase Entry of food into the stomach initiates the two primary stimuli for the gastric phase of acid secretion (Fig. 42-10). First, the food distends the gastric mucosa, which activates a vagovagal reflex as well as local ENS reflexes. Second, partially digested proteins stimulate antral G cells.

Distention of the gastric wall-both in the corpus and antrum-secondary to entry of food into the stomach elicits two distinct neurally mediated pathways. The first is activation of a vagovagal reflex (see p. 857), in which gastric wall distention activates a vagal afferent pathway, resulting in a vagal efferent response in the dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve. Stimulation of acid secretion in response to this vagal

efferent stimulus occurs via the same four parallel pathways that are operative when the vagus nerve is activated during the cephalic phase (see Fig. 42-8). Second, gastric wall distention also activates a local ENS pathway that releases ACh, thereby activating parietal-cell acid secretion.

The presence of partially digested proteins (peptones) or amino acids in the antrum directly stimulates G cells to release gastrin (see Fig. 42-8). Intact proteins have no effect. Acid secretion and activation of pepsinogen are linked in a positive-feedback relationship. As discussed below, low pH enhances the conversion of pepsinogen to pepsin. Pepsin digests proteins to peptones, which promote gastrin release. Finally, gastrin promotes acid secretion, which closes the positive-feedback loop. Neither carbohydrate nor lipid participates in the regulation of gastric acid secretion. Components of wine, beer, and coffee stimulate acid secretion by this G-cell mechanism.

In addition to the two stimulatory pathways acting during the gastric phase, a third pathway inhibits gastric acid secretion by a classic negative-feedback mechanism, already noted above in our discussion of Figure 42-8. Low intragastric pH stimulates antral D cells to release somatostatin. Because somatostatin inhibits the release of gastrin by G cells, the net effect is a reduction in gastric acid secretion. The effectiveness of low pH in inhibiting gastrin release is emphasized by the following observation: Although peptones are normally a potent stimulus for gastrin release, they fail to stimulate gastrin release either when the intraluminal pH of the antrum is maintained at 1.0 or when somatostatin is infused.

The gastric phase of acid secretion, which occurs primarily as a result of gastrin release, accounts for $50 \%$ to $60 \%$ of total gastric acid secretion.

Figure 42-11 Intestinal phase of gastric acid secretion. Digested protein fragments (peptones) in the proximal small intestine stimulate gastric acid secretion by three major mechanisms.

Intestinal Phase The presence of amino acids and partially digested peptides in the proximal portion of the small intestine stimulates acid secretion by three mechanisms (Fig. 42-11). First, these peptones stimulate duodenal G cells to secrete gastrin, just as peptones stimulate antral G cells in the gastric phase. Second, peptones stimulate an unknown endocrine cell to release an additional humoral signal that has been referred to as entero-oxyntin. The chemical nature of this agent has not yet been identified. Third, amino acids absorbed by the proximal part of the small intestine stimulate acid secretion by mechanisms that require further definition.

Gastric acid secretion mediated by the intestinal phase is enhanced after a portacaval shunt. Such a shunt-used in the treatment of portal hypertension caused by chronic liver disease-diverts the portal blood that drains the small intestine around the liver on its return to the heart. Thus, the signal released from the small intestine during the intestinal phase is probably-in normal individuals-removed in part by the liver before reaching its target, the corpus of the stomach.

Approximately 5\% to 10\% of total gastric acid secretion is a result of the intestinal phase.

## Chief cells, triggered by both cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pathways, secrete multiple pepsinogens that initiate protein digestion

The chief cells in gastric glands, as well as mucous cells, secrete pepsinogens, a group of proteolytic proenyzmes (i.e., zymogens or inactive enzyme precursors) that belong to the general class of aspartic proteinases. They are activated to pepsins by cleavage of an N-terminal peptide. Pepsins are

endopeptidases that initiate the hydrolysis of ingested protein in the stomach. Although eight pepsinogen isoforms were initially identified on electrophoresis, recent classifications are based on immunological identity, so pepsinogens are most often classified as group I pepsinogens, group II pepsinogens, and cathepsin E. Group I pepsinogens predominate. They are secreted from chief cells located at the base of glands in the corpus of the stomach. Group II pepsinogens are also secreted from chief cells but, in addition, are secreted from mucous neck cells in the cardiac, corpus, and antral regions.

Pepsinogen secretion in the basal state is $\sim 20 \%$ of its maximal secretion after stimulation. Although pepsinogen secretion generally parallels the secretion of acid, the ratio of maximal to basal pepsinogen secretion is considerably less than that for acid secretion. Moreover, the cellular mechanism of pepsinogen release is quite distinct from that of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion by parietal cells. Release of pepsinogen across the apical membrane is the result of a novel process called compound exocytosis, in which secretory granules fuse with both the plasma membrane and other secretory granules. This process permits rapid and sustained secretion of pepsinogen. After stimulation, the initial peak in pepsinogen secretion is followed by a persistent lower rate of secretion. This pattern of secretion has been interpreted as reflecting an initial secretion of preformed pepsinogen, followed by the secretion of newly synthesized pepsinogen. However, more recent in vitro studies suggested that a feedback mechanism may account for the subsequent reduced rate of pepsinogen secretion.

Two groups of agonists stimulate chief cells to secrete pepsinogen. One group acts through adenylyl cyclase and cAMP, and the other acts through increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.

Agonists Acting via cAMP Chief cells have receptors for secretin/VIP, $\boldsymbol{\beta}_{2}$ adrenergic receptors, and $\mathbf{E P}_{2}$ receptors for $\mathbf{P G E}_{2}$ (see p. 64). All these receptors activate adenylyl cyclase. At lower concentrations than those required to stimulate pepsinogen secretion, $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ can also inhibit pepsinogen secretion, probably by binding to another receptor subtype.

Agonists Acting via $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Chief cells also have $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ muscarinic receptors for ACh, as well as receptors for the gastrin/ CCK family of peptides. Unlike gastric acid secretion, which is stimulated by the $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$ receptor, pepsinogen secretion is stimulated by the $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptor, which has a much higher affinity for CCK than for gastrin. Activation of both the $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptors causes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores by $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ and thereby raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. However, uncertainty exists about whether increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx is also required and about whether PKC also has a role.

Of the agonists just listed, the most important for pepsinogen secretion is ACh released in response to vagal stimulation. ACh not only stimulates chief cells to release pepsinogen, but also stimulates parietal cells to secrete acid. This gastric acid produces additional pepsinogen secretion by two different mechanisms. First, in the stomach, a fall in pH elicits a local cholinergic reflex that results in further stimulation of chief cells to release pepsinogen. Thus, the ACh that stimulates chief cells can come both from the vagus
and from the local reflex. Second, in the duodenum, acid triggers the release of secretin from S cells. By an endocrine effect, this secretin stimulates the chief cells to release more pepsinogen. The exact role or roles of histamine and gastrin in pepsinogen secretion are unclear.

## Low pH is required for both pepsinogen activation and pepsin activity

Pepsinogen is inactive and requires activation to a protease, pepsin, to initiate protein digestion. This activation occurs by spontaneous cleavage of a small N -terminal peptide fragment (the activation peptide), but only at a pH that is $<5.0$ (Fig. 42-12). Between pH 5.0 and 3.0, spontaneous activation of pepsinogen is slow, but it is extremely rapid at a pH that is $<3.0$. In addition, pepsinogen is also autoactivated; that is, newly formed pepsin itself cleaves pepsinogen to pepsin.

Once pepsin is formed, its activity is also pH dependent. It has optimal activity at a pH between 1.8 and 3.5; the precise optimal pH depends on the specific pepsin, type and concentration of substrate, and osmolality of the solution. pH values $>3.5$ reversibly inactivate pepsin, and pH values $>7.2$ irreversibly inactivate the enzyme. These considerations are sometimes useful for establishing optimal antisecretory therapy in peptic ulcer disease.

Pepsin is an endopeptidase that initiates the process of protein digestion in the stomach. Pepsin action results in the release of small peptides and amino acids (peptones) that, as noted above, stimulate the release of gastrin from antral G cells; these peptones also stimulate CCK release from duodenal I cells. As previously mentioned, the peptones generated by pepsin stimulate the very acid secretion required for pepsin activation and action. Thus, the peptides that pepsin releases are important in initiating a coordinated response to a meal. However, most protein entering the duodenum remains as large peptides, and nitrogen balance is not impaired after total gastrectomy.

Digestive products of both carbohydrates and lipids are also found in the stomach, although secretion of their respective digestive enzymes either does not occur or is not a major function of gastric epithelial cells. Carbohydrate digestion is initiated in the mouth by salivary amylase. However, after
![bo224869338f](bo224869338f.jpg)

Figure 42-12 Activation of the pepsinogens to pepsins. At pH values from 5 to 3, pepsinogens spontaneously activate to pepsins by the removal of an N-terminal "activation peptide." This spontaneous activation is even faster at pH values that are $<3$. The newly formed pepsins themselves-which are active only at pH values $<3.5$-also can catalyze the activation of pepsinogens.

this enzyme is swallowed, the stomach becomes a more important site for starch hydrolysis than the mouth. The stomach itself does not secrete enzymes that hydrolyze starch or other saccharides. Lipid digestion also is initiated in the mouth by lingual lipase. However, significant lipid digestion occurs in the stomach as a result of both the lingual lipase that is swallowed and gastric lipase, both of which have an acid pH optimum (see pp. 927-928).

## PROTECTION OF THE GASTRIC SURFACE EPITHELIUM AND NEUTRALIZATION OF ACID IN THE DUODENUM

At maximal rates of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secretion, the parietal cell can drive the intraluminal pH of the stomach to 1 or less (i.e., $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]>$ 100 mM ) for long periods. The gastric epithelium must maintain an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration gradient of more than a million-fold because the intracellular pH of gastric epithelial cells is $\sim 7.2$ (i.e., $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \cong 60 \mathrm{nM}$ ) and plasma pH is $\sim 7.4$ (i.e., $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \cong 40 \mathrm{nM}$ ). Simultaneously, the plasma-to-lumen $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ concentration ratio can approach $\sim 30$ because plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$ is 140 mM , whereas intragastric $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$can reach values as low as 5 mM , but only at high secretory rates (see Fig. 42-2). How is the stomach able to maintain these gradients? How is it that the epithelial cells are not destroyed by this acidity? Moreover, why do pepsins in the gastric lumen not digest the epithelial cells? The answer to all three questions is the so-called gastric diffusion barrier.

Although the nature of the gastric diffusion barrier had been controversial, it is now recognized that the diffusion barrier is both physiological and anatomical. Moreover, it is apparent that the diffusion barrier is characterized by at least three components: (1) relative impermeability to acid of the apical membrane and epithelial-cell tight junctions in the gastric glands, (2) a mucous gel layer varying in thickness between 50 and $200 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ overlying the surface epithelial cells, and (3) an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-containing microclimate adjacent to the surface epithelial cells that maintains a relatively high local pH .

## Vagal stimulation and irritation stimulate gastric mucous cells to secrete mucins

The mucous layer is largely composed of mucins, phospholipids, electrolytes, and water. Gastric mucins-MUC1, MUC5, and MUC6-are the high-molecular-weight glycoproteins (see p. 38) that contribute to the formation of a protective layer over the gastric mucosa. These mucins are oligomers (di-, tri-, and tetramers) and higher-order multimers of peptides joined by disulfide bonds. Each peptide chain is linked to long polysaccharides, which are often sulfated and are thus mutually repulsive. The ensuing high carbohydrate content is responsible for the viscosity of mucus, which explains, in large part, its protective role in gastric mucosal physiology.

Mucus is secreted by three different mucous cells: surface mucous cells (i.e., on the surface of the stomach), mucous neck cells (i.e., at the point where a gastric pit joins a gastric gland), and glandular mucous cells (i.e., in the gastric glands in the antrum). The type of mucus secreted by these
cells differs; mucus that is synthesized and secreted in the glandular cells is a neutral glycoprotein, whereas the mucous cells on the surface and in the gastric pits secrete both neutral and acidic glycoproteins. Mucin forms a mucous gel layer in combination with phospholipids, electrolytes, and water. This mucous gel layer provides protection against injury from noxious luminal substances, including acid, pepsins, bile acids, and ethanol. Mucin also lubricates the gastric mucosa to minimize the abrasive effects of intraluminal food.

The mucous barrier is not static. Abrasions can remove pieces of mucus. When mucus comes in contact with a solution with a very low pH , the mucus precipitates and sloughs off. Thus, the mucous cells must constantly secrete mucus. Regulation of mucus secretion by gastric mucosal cells is less well understood than is regulation of the secretion of acid, pepsinogens, and other substances by gastric cells. The two primary stimuli for inducing mucus secretion are vagal stimulation and physical and chemical irritation of the gastric mucosa by ingested food. The current model of mucus secretion suggests that vagal stimulation induces the release of ACh , which leads to increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thus stimulates mucus secretion. Unlike for acid and pepsinogen secretion, cAMP does not appear to be a second messenger for mucus secretion.

## Gastric surface cells secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, stimulated by acetylcholine, acids, and prostaglandins

Surface epithelial cells both in the corpus and in the antrum of the stomach secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Despite the relatively low rate of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion-in comparison with acid secre-tion- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is extremely important as part of the gastric mucosal protective mechanism. The mucous gel layer provides an unstirred layer under which the secreted $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ remains trapped and maintains a local pH of $\sim 7.0$ versus an intraluminal pH in the bulk phase of 1 to 3 . As illustrated in Figure 42-13A, an electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$cotransporter (NBC) appears to mediate the uptake of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$across the basolateral membrane of surface epithelial cells. The electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger SLC26A9 appears to mediate the exit of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the apical mucous layer.

Similar to the situation for mucus secretion, relatively limited information is available about the regulation of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. The present model suggests that vagal stimulation mediated by ACh leads to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, which, in turn, stimulates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. Sham feeding is a potent stimulus for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion via this pathway. A second powerful stimulus for gastric $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion is intraluminal acid. The mechanism of stimulation by acid appears to be secondary to both activation of neural reflexes and local production of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$. Finally, evidence suggests that a humoral factor may also be involved in the induction of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by acid.

## Mucus protects the gastric surface epithelium by trapping an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich fluid near the apical border of these cells

Mucous cells on the surface of the stomach, as well as in the gastric pits and neck portions of the gastric glands,

B DAMAGED MUCOSAL BARRIER
![bo244869338f](bo244869338f.jpg)
secrete both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and mucus. Why is this barrier so effective? First, the secreted mucus forms a mucous gel layer that is relatively impermeable to the diffusion of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ from the gastric lumen to the surface cells. Second, beneath this layer of mucus is a microclimate that contains fluid with a high pH and high $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, the result of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by gastric surface epithelial cells (see Fig. 42-13A). Thus, this $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$neutralizes most acid that diffuses through the mucous layer. Mucosal integrity, including that of the mucosal diffusion barrier, is also maintained by $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, which-as discussed in the previous section-stimulates mucosal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion.

Deep inside the gastric gland, where no obvious mucous layer protects the parietal, chief, and ECL cells, the impermeability of the cells' apical barrier appears to exclude $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ even at pH values as low as 1 . The paradox of how HCl secreted by the parietal cells emerges from the gland and into the gastric lumen may be explained by a process known as viscous fingering. Because the liquid emerging from the gastric gland is both extremely acidic and presumably under pressure, it can tunnel through the mucous layer covering the opening of the gastric gland onto the surface of the stomach. However, this stream of acid apparently does not spread laterally, but rather rises to the surface as a "finger" and thus does not neutralize the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the microenvironment between the surface epithelial cells and the mucus.

The mucous gel layer and the trapped alkaline $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ solution protect the surface cells not only from $\mathrm{H}^{+}$but also from pepsin. The mucus per se acts as a pepsin-diffusion barrier. The relative alkalinity of the trapped $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$inactivates any pepsin that penetrates the mucus. Recall that pepsin is reversibly inactivated at pH values greater than $\sim 3.5$ and is irreversibly inactivated by pH values greater than $\sim 7.2$. Thus, the mucus $/ \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$layer plays an important role in preventing autodigestion of the gastric mucosa (Box 42-2).

## Acid entry into the duodenum induces $\$$ cells to release secretin, triggering the pancreas and duodenum to secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

The overall process of regulating gastric acid secretion involves not only stimulation and inhibition of acid secretion (as discussed above), but also neutralization of the gastric acid that passes from the stomach into the duodenum. The amount of secreted gastric acid is reflected by a fall in intragastric pH . We have already seen that this fall in pH serves as the signal to antral D cells to release somatostatin and thus

Figure 42-13 Diffusion barrier in the surface of the gastric mucosa. A, The mucus secreted by the surface cells acts as a diffusion barrier for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and traps a relatively alkaline solution of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titrates any $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that diffuses into the gel layer from the stomach lumen. The alkaline layer also inactivates any pepsin that penetrates into the mucus. B, If $\mathrm{H}^{+}$penetrates into the gastric epithelium, it damages mast cells, which release histamine and other agents, setting up an inflammatory response. If the insult is mild, the ensuing increase in blood flow can promote the secretion of both mucus and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. If the insult is more severe, the inflammatory response leads to a decrease in blood flow and thus to cell injury.

## BOX 42-2 Breakdown of the Gastric Barrier

The integrity of the gastric epithelial barrier can be conveniently judged by maintenance of a high lumen-negative transepithelial potential difference (PD) of approximately -60 mV . Several agents that cause mucosal injury, including mucosal ulceration, can alter the mucosal diffusion barrier. Salicylates, bile acids, and ethanol all impair the mucosal diffusion barrier and result in $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(acid) back-diffusion, an increase in intraluminal ( $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$), a fall in PD, and mucosal damage (see Fig. 42-13B). Three decades ago, Davenport proposed an attractive model to explain how $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, after having breached the mucosal diffusion barrier, produces injury to the gastric mucosa. Although several details of this original model have been modified during the ensuing years, it is still believed that entry of acid into the mucosa damages mast cells, which release histamine and other mediators of inflammation. The histamine and other agents cause local vasodilation that increases blood flow. If the damage is not too severe, this response allows the surface cells to maintain their production of mucus and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. However, if the injury is more severe, inflammatory cells release a host of agents-including plateletactivating factor, leukotrienes, endothelins, thromboxanes, and oxidants-that reduce blood flow (ischemia) and result in tissue injury, including capillary damage.

Prostaglandins play a central role in maintaining mucosal integrity. For example, prostaglandins prevent or reverse mucosal injury secondary to salicylates, bile, and ethanol. This protective effect of prostaglandins is the result of several actions, including their ability to inhibit acid secretion, stimulate both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and mucus secretion, increase mucosal blood flow, and modify the local inflammatory response induced by acid.
to inhibit further acid secretion, a classic negative-feedback process. Similarly, low pH in the duodenum serves as a signal for the secretion of alkali to neutralize gastric acid in the duodenum.

The key factor in this neutralization process is secretin, the same secretin that inhibits gastric acid secretion and promotes pepsinogen secretion by chief cells. A low duodenal pH , with a threshold of 4.5 , triggers the release of secretin from $\mathbf{S}$ cells in the duodenum. However, the $S$ cells are probably not pH sensitive themselves but, instead, may respond to a signal from other cells that are pH sensitive. Secretin stimulates the secretion of fluid and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$by the pancreas (see pp. 886-887), thus leading to intraduodenal neutralization of the acid load from the stomach. Maximal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion is a function of the amount of acid entering the duodenum, as well as the length of duodenum exposed to acid. Thus, high rates of gastric acid secretion trigger the release of large amounts of secretin, which greatly stimulates pancreatic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion; the increased $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, in turn, neutralizes the increased duodenal acid load.

In addition to pancreatic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion, the duodenal acid load resulting from gastric acid secretion is partially neutralized by duodenal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. This duodenal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion occurs in the proximal-but not the distalpart of the duodenum under the influence of prostaglandins. Attention has been focused on duodenal epithelial cells (villus or crypt cells) as the cellular source of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion, but the possibility that duodenal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$originates, at

## BOX 42-3 Helicobacter pylori

During the past decade, our understanding of the etiology of duodenal and gastric ulcers has radically changed. Abundant evidence now indicates that most peptic ulcers are an infectious disease that in most (but not all) cases is caused by Helicobacter pylori, a gram-negative bacillus that colonizes the antral mucosa. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are responsible for $\sim 20 \%$ of ulcers. Although almost all ulcers that are not associated with NSAID use are secondary to $H$. pylori infection, many, if not most, individuals with evidence of $H$. pylori infection do not have peptic ulcer disease. The factors responsible for $H$. pylori-induced inflammation or ulceration are not known. However, the increase in gastric acid secretion that is present in most patients with duodenal ulcers may occur because $H$. pylori-induced antral inflammation inhibits the release of somatostatin by antral D cells. Because somatostatin normally inhibits gastrin release by antral G cells, the result would be increased gastrin release and thus increased gastric acid secretion. Indeed, as noted in Table 42-1, serum gastrin levels are modestly elevated in patients with duodenal ulcers.

Inhibition of acid secretion heals, but does not cure, H. pylori-induced peptic ulcers. However, antibiotic therapy that eradicates $H$. pylori cures peptic ulcer disease. For their pioneering work on H. pylori, Barry J. Marshall and J. Robin Warren shared the 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (3) N42-5.
least in part, from duodenal submucosal Brunner's glands has not been excluded. The mechanism of duodenal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion is similar to that in the pancreatic duct (see Fig. 43-6), and involves both $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) in the apical membrane. Patients with duodenal ulcer disease tend to have both increased gastric acid secretion and reduced duodenal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion (Box 42-3). Thus, the increased acid load in the duodenum is only partially neutralized, so the duodenal mucosa has increased exposure to a low-pH solution.

## FILLING AND EMPTYING OF THE STOMACH

## Gastric motor activity plays a role in filling, churning, and emptying

Gastric motor activity has three functions: (1) The receipt of ingested material represents the reservoir function of the stomach and occurs as smooth muscle relaxes. This response occurs primarily in the proximal portion of the stomach. (2) Ingested material is churned and is thereby altered to a form that rapidly empties from the stomach through the pylorus and facilitates normal jejunal digestion and absorption. Thus, in conjunction with gastric acid and enzymes, the motor function of the stomach helps to initiate digestion. (3) The pyloric antrum, pylorus, and proximal part of the duodenum function as a single unit for emptying into the duodenum the modified gastric contents (chyme), consisting of both partially digested food material and gastric secretions. Gastric filling and emptying are accomplished by the coordinated activity of smooth muscle

## BOX 42-4 Vomiting

$V$ vomiting, a frequent sign and symptom in clinical medicine, represents a complex series of multiple afferent stimuli coordinated by one or more brain centers, leading to a coordinated neuromuscular response. Nausea is the sensation that vomiting may occur. The act of emesis involves several preprogrammed coordinated smooth- and striatedmuscle responses. The initial event is the abolition of intestinal slow-wave activity that is linked to propulsive peristaltic contractions. As the normal peristaltic contractions of the stomach and small intestine wane, they are replaced by retrograde contractions, beginning in the ileum and progressing to the stomach. These retrograde contractions are accompanied by contraction of abdominal and inspiratory muscles (external intercostal muscles and diaphragm; see pp. 606-607) against a closed glottis, which results in an increase in intra-abdominal pressure. Relaxation of the diaphragmatic crural muscle and lower esophageal sphincter permits transmission of this increase in intra-abdominal pressure into the thorax, with expulsion of the gastric contents into the esophagus. Movement of the larynx upward and forward and relaxation of the upper esophageal sphincter are required for oral propulsion, whereas closure of the glottis prevents aspiration.

Three major categories of stimuli can potentially induce the foregoing series of events that leads to vomiting. First, gastric irritants and peritonitis, for example, probably act by vagal afferent pathways, presumably to rid the body of the irritant. Second, inner ear dysfunction or motion sickness acts through the vestibular nerve and vestibular nuclei. Third, drugs such as digitalis and certain cancer chemotherapeutic agents activate the area postrema in the brain (see p. 284). Pregnancy can also cause nausea and vomiting, by an unknown mechanism. Although several central loci receive these emetic stimuli, the primary locus is the area postrema, also called the chemoreceptor trigger zone. Although no single brainstem site coordinates vomiting, the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS; see p. 348) plays an important role in the initiation of emesis. Neurotransmitter receptors that are important in various causes of vomiting include the $\mathrm{NK}_{1}$ receptor (which binds substance $P$ ) in the NTS, 5-hydroxytryptamine type $3\left(5-\mathrm{HT}_{3}\right)$ receptors in vagal afferents, and dopamine $D_{2}$ receptors in the vestibular nucleus.
in the esophagus, lower esophageal sphincter, and proximal and distal portions of the stomach, as well as the pylorus and duodenum (Box 42-4).

The pattern of gastric smooth-muscle activity is distinct during fasting and after eating. The pattern during fasting is referred to as the migrating myoelectric (or motor) complex (MMC). This pattern is terminated by eating, at which point it is replaced by the so-called fed pattern. Just as the proximal and distal regions of the stomach differ in secretory function, they also differ in the motor function responsible for storing, processing, and emptying liquids and solids. The proximal part of the stomach is the primary location for storage of both liquids and solids. The distal portion of the stomach is primarily responsible for churning the solids and generating smaller liquid-like material, which then exits the stomach in a manner similar to that of ingested liquids. Thus, the gastric emptying of liquids and of solids is closely integrated.

## Filling of the stomach is facilitated by both receptive relaxation and gastric accommodation

Even a dry swallow relaxes both the lower esophageal sphincter and the proximal part of the stomach. Of course, the same happens when we swallow food. These relaxations facilitate the entry of food into the stomach. Relaxation in the fundus is primarily regulated by a vagovagal reflex and has been called receptive relaxation. In a vagovagal reflex, afferent fibers running with the vagus nerve carry information to the central nervous system (CNS), and efferent vagal fibers carry the signal from the CNS to the stomach and cause relaxation by a mechanism that is neither cholinergic nor adrenergic. The result is that intragastric volume increases without an increase in intragastric pressure. If vagal innervation to the stomach is interrupted, gastric pressure rises much more rapidly.

Quite apart from the receptive relaxation of the stomach that anticipates the arrival of food after swallowing and esophageal distention, the stomach can also relax in response to gastric filling per se. Thus, increasing intragastric volume, as a result of either entry of food into the stomach or gastric secretion, does not produce a proportionate increase in intragastric pressure. Instead, small increases in volume do not cause increases in intragastric pressure until a threshold is reached, after which intragastric pressure rises steeply (Fig. 42-14A). This phenomenon is the result of active dilation of the fundus, called gastric accommodation. Vagotomy abolishes a major portion of gastric accommodation, so increases in intragastric volume produce greater increases in intragastric pressure. However, the role of the vagus nerve in gastric accommodation is one of modulation. It is generally believed that the ENS (see pp. 855-856) is the primary regulator permitting the storage of substantial amounts of solids and liquids in the proximal part of the stomach without major increases in intragastric pressure.

## The stomach churns its contents until the particles are small enough to be gradually emptied into the duodenum

The substance most rapidly emptied by the stomach is isotonic saline or water. Emptying of these liquids occurs without delay and is faster the greater the volume of fluid. Acidic and caloric fluids leave the stomach more slowly, whereas fatty materials exit even more slowly (see Fig. 42-14B). Solids do not leave the stomach as such, but must first be reduced in size (i.e., trituration). Particles $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$ do not leave the stomach during the immediate postprandial digestive period. The delay in gastric emptying of solids occurs because solids must be reduced in size to $<2 \mathrm{~mm}$; at that point, they are emptied by mechanisms similar to those for liquids.

Movement of solid particles toward the antrum is accomplished by the interaction of propulsive gastric contractions and occlusion of the pylorus, a process termed propulsion (Fig. 42-15A). Gastric contractions are initiated by the gastric pacemaker, which is located on the greater curvature, approximately at the junction of the proximal and middle portions of the stomach. These contractions propel the luminal contents toward the pylorus, which is partially

closed by contraction of the pyloric musculature before delivery of the bolus. This increase in pyloric resistance represents the coordinated response of antral, pyloric, and duodenal motor activity. Once a bolus of material is trapped near the antrum, it is churned to help reduce the size of the particles, a process termed grinding (see Fig. 42-15B). Only a small portion of gastric material-that containing particles $<2 \mathrm{~mm}$-is propelled through the pylorus to the duodenum. Thus, most gastric contents are returned to the body of the stomach for pulverization and shearing of solid particles, a process known as retropulsion (see Fig. 42-15C). These processes of propulsion, grinding, and retropulsion repeat multiple times until the gastric contents are emptied. Particles $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$ are initially retained in the stomach but

are eventually emptied into the duodenum by MMCs during the interdigestive period that begins $\sim 2$ hours or more after eating.

Modification of gastric contents is associated with the activation of multiple feedback mechanisms. This feedback usually arises from the duodenum (and beyond) and almost always results in a delay in gastric emptying. Thus, as small squirts of gastric fluid leave the stomach, chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors-primarily in the proximal but also in the distal portion of the small intestine-sense low pH , high caloric content, lipid, certain amino acids (i.e., tryptophan), or changes in osmolarity. These signals all decrease the rate of gastric emptying by a combination of neural and hormonal signals, including the vagus nerve, secretin, CCK, and GIP released from duodenal mucosa. Delayed gastric emptying involves (1) the coordinated function of fundic relaxation, (2) inhibition of antral motor activity, (3) stimulation of isolated, phasic contractions of the pyloric sphincter, (4) and altered intestinal motor activity.

# PANCREATIC AND SALIVARY GLANDS 

Christopher R. Marino and Fred S. Gorelick

## OVERVIEW OF EXOCRINE GLAND PHYSIOLOGY

## The pancreas and major salivary glands are compound exocrine glands

The exocrine pancreas and major salivary glands are compound exocrine glands-specialized secretory organs that contain a branching ductular system through which they release their secretory products. The principal function of these exocrine glands is to aid in the digestion of food. The saliva produced by the salivary glands lubricates ingested food and initiates the digestion of starch. Pancreatic juice, rich in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and digestive enzymes, neutralizes the acidic gastric contents that enter the small intestine and also completes the intraluminal digestion of ingested carbohydrate, protein, and fat. Each of these exocrine glands is under the control of neural and humoral signals that generate a sequential and coordinated secretory response to an ingested meal. We discuss the endocrine pancreas in Chapter 51.

Morphologically, the pancreas and salivary glands are divided into small but visible lobules, each of which represents a subdivision of the parenchyma and is drained by a single intralobular duct (Fig. 43-1A). Groups of lobules separated by connective tissue septa are drained by larger interlobular ducts. These interlobular ducts empty into a main duct that connects the entire gland to the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract.

Within the lobules reside the microscopic structural and functional secretory units of the gland. Each secretory unit is composed of an acinus and a small intercalated duct. The acinus represents a cluster of 15 to 100 acinar cells that synthesize and secrete proteins into the lumen of the epithelial structure. In the pancreas, acinar cells secrete $\sim 20$ different digestive zymogens (inactive enzyme precursors) and enzymes. In the salivary glands, the principal acinar cell protein products are $\alpha$-amylase, mucins, and proline-rich proteins. Acinar cells from both the pancreas and salivary glands also secrete an isotonic, plasma-like fluid that accompanies the secretory proteins. In all, the final acinar secretion is a protein-rich product known as the primary secretion.

Each acinar lumen is connected to the proximal end of an intercalated duct. Distally, the intercalated ducts fuse with other small ducts to form progressively larger ducts that ultimately coalesce to form the intralobular duct that drains the lobule. Although the ducts provide a conduit for the transport of secretory proteins, the epithelial cells lining the
ducts also play an important role in modifying the fluid and electrolyte composition of the primary secretion. Thus, the final exocrine gland secretion represents the combined product of two distinct epithelial-cell populations, the acinar cell and the duct cell.

In addition to acini and ducts, exocrine glands contain a rich supply of nerves and blood vessels. Postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic fibers contribute to the autonomic regulation of secretion through the release of cholinergic, adrenergic, and peptide neurotransmitters that often bind to receptors on the acinar and duct cells. These efferent fibers also regulate blood flow. Both central and reflex pathways contribute to the neural regulation of exocrine secretion. The autonomic nerves also carry afferent pain fibers that are activated by glandular inflammation and trauma. The vasculature not only provides oxygen and nutrients for the gland but also carries the hormones that help to regulate secretion.

## Acinar cells are specialized protein-synthesizing cells

Acinar cells-such as those in the pancreas (see Fig. 43-1B) and salivary glands (see Fig. 43-10, below)-are polarized epithelial cells that are specialized for the production and export of large quantities of protein. Thus, the acinar cell is equipped with extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum. However, the most characteristic feature of the acinar cell is the abundance of electron-dense secretory granules at the apical pole of the cell. These granules are storage pools of secretory proteins, and they are poised to release their contents after stimulation of the cell by neurohumoral agents. The secretory granules of pancreatic acinar cells contain the mixture of zymogens and enzymes required for digestion. The secretory granules of salivary acinar cells contain either $\alpha$-amylase (in the parotid gland) or mucins (in the sublingual glands). Secretory granules in the pancreas appear uniform, whereas those in the salivary glands often exhibit focal nodules of condensation within the granules known as spherules.

The pancreatic acinar cell has served as an important model for elucidating protein synthesis and export via the secretory pathway (Fig. 43-2). Synthesis of secretory proteins (see pp. 34-35) begins with the cellular uptake of amino acids and their incorporation into nascent proteins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Vesicular transport mechanisms then shuttle the newly synthesized proteins to the Golgi complex.

![bo304869338f](bo304869338f.jpg)

Figure 43-1 Pancreatic acinus and duct morphology. A, The fundamental secretory unit is composed of an acinus and an intercalated duct. Intercalated ducts merge to form intralobular ducts, which in turn merge to form interlobular ducts, and then the main pancreatic duct. B, The acinar cell is specialized for protein secretion. Large condensing vacuoles are gradually reduced in size and form mature zymogen granules that store digestive enzymes in the apical region of the acinar cell. C, The duct cell is a cuboidal cell with abundant mitochondria. Small microvilli project from its apical membrane.

Within the Golgi complex, secretory proteins are segregated away from lysosomal enzymes. Most lysosomal enzymes require the mannose-6-phosphate receptor for sorting to the lysosome (see p. 40). However, the signals required to direct digestive enzymes into the secretory pathway remain unclear.

Secretory proteins exit the Golgi complex in condensing vacuoles or immature secretory granules. These large membrane-bound structures are acidic and maintain the lowest pH within the secretory pathway.

Maturation of the condensing vacuole to a secretory or zymogen granule is marked by condensation of the proteins within the vacuole and pinching off of membrane vesicles. The diameter of a secretory (zymogen) granule is about two thirds that of a condensing vacuole, and its content is more
electron dense. Secretory proteins are stored in zymogen granules that are located in the apical region of the acinar cell. The bottom portion of Figure 43-2 shows the results of a pulse-chase experiment that follows the cellular itinerary of radiolabeled amino acids as they move sequentially through the four major compartments of the secretory pathway.

Exocytosis, the process by which secretory granules release their contents, is a complex series of events that involves the movement of the granules to the apical membrane, fusion of these granules with the membrane, and release of their contents into the acinar lumen. Secretion is triggered by stimulation of cell-surface receptors by either hormones or neurotransmitters (neurohumoral stimulation). At the onset of secretion, the surface area of the apical

Figure 43-2 Movement of newly synthesized proteins through the secretory pathway. The four records in the graph show the time course of radiolabeled secretory proteins present in each compartment. (Data from Jamieson J, Palade G: J Cell Biol 34:597-615, 1967; and Jamieson J, Palade G: J Cell Biol 50:135-158, 1971.)
plasma membrane transiently increases as much as 30 -fold. Thereafter, activation of an apical endocytic pathway leads to retrieval of the secretory granule membrane for recycling and a decrease in the area of the apical plasma membrane back to its resting value. Thus, during the steady state of secretion, secretory granule membrane is simultaneously delivered to and retrieved from the apical membrane.

Before the exocytotic event, vacuolar-type H pumps (see pp. 118-119) in the vesicle membrane use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cytosol to the lumen of the vesicle. This transport process sets up both a chemical gradient for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(inside acid) and an electrical gradient (inside positive) across the vesicle membrane. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels in the vesicle membrane can then allow $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to flow into the vesicle lumen, in parallel with the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, so that the overall process is HCl movement from cytosol to vesicle lumen. Water follows by osmosis. The above "secretion" of minute amounts of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the secretory vesicle may contribute to the hydration of proteins within the granule before vesicle fusion. Furthermore, exocytosis of the vesicle contents may lead to a transient acidification of the acinar lumen and may modulate adjacent epithelial cells.

The cytoskeleton of the acinar cell plays an important role in the regulation of exocytosis. A component of the actin network appears to be required for delivery of the secretory granules to the apical region of the cell. A second actin
network, located immediately below the apical membrane, acts as a barrier that blocks fusion of the granules with the apical plasma membrane. On stimulation, this second network reorganizes and then releases the blockade to permit the secretory granules to approach the apical plasma membrane. Fusion of the granules with the plasma membrane probably requires the interaction of SNAREs on secretory granules and the apical plasma membrane, as well as various other factors (see p. 37). After fusion, the granule contents enter the acinar lumen and move down the ducts into the gastrointestinal tract.

## Duct cells are epithelial cells specialized for fluid and electrolyte transport

Pancreatic and salivary duct cells are polarized epithelial cells specialized for the transport of electrolytes across distinct apical and basolateral membrane domains. Duct epithelial cells contain specific membrane transporters and an abundance of mitochondria to provide energy for active transport, and they exhibit varying degrees of basolateral membrane infolding that increases the membrane surface area of pancreatic duct cells (see Fig. 43-1C) and salivary duct cells (see Fig. 43-10C). Although some duct cells contain prominent cytoplasmic vesicles, the synthetic machinery (i.e., ER and Golgi complex) of the duct cell is, in general, much less developed than that of the acinar cell.

Duct cells exhibit a considerable degree of morphological heterogeneity along the length of the ductal tree. At the junction between acinar and duct cells, and protruding into the pancreatic lumen, are small cuboidal epithelial cells known as centroacinar cells. These cells express very high levels of carbonic anhydrase (see p. 630) and presumably play a role in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. The epithelial cells of the most proximal (intercalated) duct are squamous or low cuboidal, have an abundance of mitochondria, and tend to lack cytoplasmic vesicles. These features suggest that the primary function of these cells is fluid and electrolyte transport. Progressing distally, the cells become more cuboidal columnar and contain more cytoplasmic vesicles and granules. These features suggest that these cells are capable of both transport of fluid and electrolytes and secretion of proteins. Functional studies indicate that the types of solute transport proteins within duct cells differ depending on the cell's location in the ductal tree.

Ion transport in duct cells is regulated by neurohumoral stimuli that act through specific receptors located on the basolateral membrane. As is the case for cells elsewhere in the body, duct cells can increase transcellular electrolyte movement either by activating individual transport proteins or by increasing the number of transport proteins in the plasma membrane.

## Goblet cells contribute to mucin production in exocrine glands

In addition to acinar and duct cells, exocrine glands contain varying numbers of goblet cells. These cells secrete high-molecular-weight glycoproteins known as mucins (see p. 874). When hydrated, mucins form mucus. Mucus has several important functions, including lubrication, hydration, and

mechanical protection of surface epithelial cells. Mucins also play an important immunological role by binding to pathogens and interacting with immune-competent cells. These properties may help to prevent infections. In the pancreas, mucin-secreting goblet cells are primarily found among the epithelial cells that line the large distal ducts. They can account for as many as $25 \%$ of the epithelial cells in the distal main pancreatic duct of some species. In the salivary gland, goblet cells are also seen in the large distal ducts, although in less abundance than in the pancreas. However, in many salivary glands, mucin is also secreted by acinar cells.

## PANCREATIC ACINAR CELL

## The acinar cell secretes digestive proteins in response to stimulation

To study secretion at the cellular level, investigators use enzymatically separated single acini ( 15 to 100 cells) or mechanically dissected single lobules ( 250 to 1000 cells). The measure of secretion is the release of digestive proteins into the incubation medium. The amount released over a fixed time interval is expressed as a percentage of the total content at the outset of the experiment. Because amylase is released in a fully active form, it is common to use the appearance of amylase activity as a marker for secretion by acinar cells.

When the acinar cells are in an unstimulated state, they secrete low levels of digestive proteins via a constitutive secretory pathway. Acinar cells stimulated by neurohumoral agents secrete proteins via a regulated pathway. Regulated secretion by isolated acinar cells in vitro is detected within 5 minutes of stimulation and is energy dependent. During a 30 - to 60 -minute stimulation period, acinar cells typically secrete 5 to 10 times more amylase than with constitutive
release. However, during this period of regulated secretion, the cells typically secrete only $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of the digestive proteins stored in their granules. Moreover, acinar cells are able to increase their rate of protein synthesis to replenish their stores.

The acinar cell exhibits two distinct patterns of regulated secretion: monophasic and biphasic (Fig. 43-3A). Increasing levels of an agonist that generates a monophasic doseresponse relationship (e.g., gastrin-releasing peptide [GRP]) causes secretion to reach a maximal level that does not fall with higher concentrations of the agent. In contrast, increasing levels of a secretagogue that elicits a biphasic doseresponse relationship (e.g., cholecystokinin and carbachol) causes secretion to reach a maximal level that subsequently diminishes. As discussed below, this biphasic response may reflect the presence of functionally separate high-affinity and low-affinity receptors, and is related to the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. (C) N43-1

## Acetylcholine and cholecystokinin mediate the regulated secretion of proteins by pancreatic acinar cells

Although at least a dozen different receptors are present on the plasma membrane of the pancreatic acinar cell, the most important in regulating protein secretion is the $\mathbf{M}_{1}$ muscarinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor (see p. 341), located on the basolateral membrane and also found in many glandular tissues.

Two closely related receptors for cholecystokinin (CCK) are distinguished by their structure, affinity for ligands, and tissue distribution (see p. 867). Although both CCK receptors may be activated by CCK or gastrin, the $\mathbf{C C K}_{1}$ receptor (previously known as $\mathrm{CCK}_{A}$, encoded by the CCK1R gene) has a much higher affinity for CCK than for gastrin, whereas

# N43-1 Acute Pancreatitis 

## Contributed by Fred Gorelick

Acute pancreatitis is an inflammatory condition that may cause extensive local damage to the pancreas as well as compromise the function of other organs such as the lungs. The most common factors that initiate human acute pancreatitis are alcohol ingestion and gallstones. However, other insults may also precipitate acute pancreatitis. Hypertriglyceridemia, an inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, is one such culprit. Less commonly, toxins that increase ACh levels, such as cholinesterase inhibitors (some insecticides) or the sting of scorpions found in the Caribbean and South and Central America, may lead to pancreatitis. Supraphysiological levels of ACh probably cause pancreatitis by overstimulating the pancreatic acinar cell.

Experimental models of pancreatitis suggest a primary defect in protein processing and acinar cell secretory function. More than 100 years ago, it was found that treating animals with doses of ACh that are 10 to 100 times greater than those that elicit maximal enzyme secretion causes "hyperstimulation" pancreatitis. The same type of injury can be generated by CCK. The injury in this model appears to be linked to two events within the acinar
cell: (1) Zymogens, in particular proteases, are pathologically processed within the acinar cell into active forms. In this model, the protective mechanisms outlined in Table 43-3 are overwhelmed, and active enzymes are generated within the acinar cell. (2) Acinar cell secretion is inhibited, and the active enzymes are retained within the cell. Although premature activation of zymogens is probably an important step in initiating pancreatitis, other events are important for perpetuating injury, including inflammation, induction of apoptosis, vascular injury, and occlusion that results in decreased blood flow and reduced tissue oxygenation (ischemia).

Knowledge of the mechanisms of acute pancreatitis may lead to effective therapies. In experimental models, administration of serine protease inhibitors that block the activation of pancreatic zymogens improves the course of the acute pancreatitis. In some clinical forms of pancreatitis, prophylactic administration of the protease inhibitor gabexate appears to reduce the severity of the disease.

Figure 43-4 Stimulation of protein secretion from the pancreatic acinar cell. A, The pancreatic acinar cell has at least two pathways for stimulating the insertion of zymogen granules and thus releasing digestive enzymes. B, Applying a physiological dose of CCK (i.e., 10 pM ) triggers a series of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ oscillations. However, applying a supraphysiological concentration of CCK ( 1 nM )—a dose that could initiate pancreatitiselicits a single large $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ spike, halts the oscillations, and decreases amylase secretion. Recall from Figure 43-3 that high levels of CCK also are less effective in causing amylase secretion. AC, adenylyl cyclase; CaM, calmodulin; $\mathrm{PIP}_{3}$, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate; PK, protein kinases other than PKA and PKC; PP, phosphoprotein phosphatases. (B, Data from Tsunoda Y, Stuenkel EL, Williams JA: Characterization of sustained $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ increase in pancreatic acinar cells and its relation to amylase secretion. Am J Physiol 259:G792G801, 1990.)
the $\mathrm{CCK}_{2}$ receptor (previously known as $\mathrm{CCK}_{B}$, encoded by CCK2R gene) has approximately equal affinities for CCK and gastrin. In some species, both forms of the CCK receptor are present on the acinar cell. Although $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptors are present in human acinar cells, their function is unknown. (5) N43-2
$\mathrm{M}_{3}$ and CCK receptors have many similarities: both are basolateral, both are linked to the $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\alpha}$ heterotrimeric G protein, both use the phospholipase C (PLC)/Ca ${ }^{2+}$ signaltransduction pathway (see pp. 58-60), and both lead to increased enzyme secretion from the acinar cell.

Numerous other receptors-including those for gastrinreleasing peptide (GRP; see p. 868), calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP; see p. 1067), insulin (see pp. 1035-1050), secretin (see pp. 886-887), somatostatin (see pp. 993-994), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; see Table 41-1)—are also found on the pancreatic acinar cell. Although these other receptors may also play a role in regulating secretion, protein synthesis, growth, and transformation, their precise physiological functions remain to be clearly defined.

Activation of receptors that stimulate different signaltransduction pathways may lead to an enhanced secretory response. For example, as shown in Figure 43-3B, simultaneous stimulation of the high-affinity CCK receptor (which acts via $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ ) and the VIP receptor (which acts via cAMP) generates an additive effect on secretion. Alternatively, acinar cells that have previously been stimulated may become temporarily refractory to subsequent stimulation. This phenomenon is known as desensitization.

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is the major second messenger for the secretion of proteins by pancreatic acinar cells

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Much of the pioneering work on the role of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in cell signaling has been performed on the pancreatic acinar cell (Fig. 43-4A). Generation of a cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signal is a complex summation of cellular events (see p. 60). Even when the acinar cell is in the resting state, the cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ level $\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}\right)$ oscillates slowly. Maximal stimulatory (i.e., physiological) concentrations of CCK or ACh increase the frequency of the oscillations (see Fig. 43-4B) but have less effect on the amplitude. This increase in the frequency of $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ oscillations is required for protein secretion by acinar cells. In contrast, a supramaximal (i.e., hyperstimulatory) concentration of CCK or ACh generates a sudden $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ spike that is 2 to 10 times greater than that seen with physiological stimulation and eliminates further $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ oscillations. This $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ spike and the subsequent absence of oscillations are associated with an inhibition of secretion that appears to be mediated by disruption of the cytoskeletal components that are required for secretion.
cAMP Secretin, VIP, and CCK increase cAMP production and thus activate protein kinase A (PKA) in pancreatic acinar cells (see Fig. 43-4A). Low concentrations of CCK cause a transient stimulation of PKA, whereas supraphysiological concentrations of CCK cause a much more prominent and prolonged increase in [cAMP] and PKA activity. One of the effects of cAMP is to enhance secretion that has

# N43-2 Affinity States of the Cholecystokinin Receptors 

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

An important feature of both CCK receptors is their ability to exist in both a high-affinity and a low-affinity state. Low (picomolar) concentrations of CCK activate the high-affinity forms of the CCK receptors and stimulate secretion. Conversely, supraphysiological (10- to 100-fold higher) concentrations of CCK activate the low-affinity forms of the receptors and inhibit secretion. These two affinity states (i.e., activated by different concentrations of CCK) of each of the two CCK receptors generate distinct second-messenger signaling patterns. It is likely that under physiological conditions, only the high-affinity states of the CCK or muscarinic receptor are activated. Stimulation of the lower-affinity states by supraphysiological concentrations of either CCK or ACh not only inhibits enzyme secretion but also may injure the acinar cell. ( $\mathbf{N 4 3 - 1}$

been stimulated by activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent pathways (see Fig. 43-3B). (5) N43-3 ACh has little, if any, effect on the cAMP signaling pathway.

Effectors As illustrated in Figure 43-4A, the most important effectors of intracellular second messengers are the protein kinases. Stimulation of CCK and muscarinic receptors on the acinar cell leads to the generation of similar $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signals and activation of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (see p. 60) and members of the protein kinase C (PKC) family (see pp. 60-61). Activation of secretin or VIP receptors increases [cAMP], and thus activates PKA. These second messengers probably also activate phosphoprotein phosphatases, as well as other protein kinases not depicted in Figure 43-4A. Some protein targets of activated kinases and phosphatases in the pancreatic acinar cell are involved in regulating secretion, whereas others mediate protein synthesis, growth, transformation, and cell death.

## In addition to proteins, the pancreatic acinar cell secretes a plasma-like fluid

Besides secreting proteins, acinar cells in the pancreas secrete an isotonic, plasma-like fluid (Fig. 43-5). This NaCl -rich fluid hydrates the dense, protein-rich material that the acinar cells secrete. The fundamental transport event is the secretion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical membrane. (5) N43-4 For transcellular (plasma-to-lumen) movement of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to occur, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$must move into the cell across the basolateral membrane. As in many other $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-secreting epithelial cells (see p. 139),
in the acinar cell basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake occurs via an $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} /$ Cl cotransporter. The $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump generates the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient that energizes the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$entering through the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and via the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter exits through $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that are also located on the basolateral membrane. Thus, a pump, a cotransporter, and a channel are necessary to sustain the basolateral uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the acinar cell.

The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{i}$ produced by basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$uptake drives the secretion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$down its electrochemical gradient through channels in the apical membrane. As the transepithelial voltage becomes more lumen negative, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$moves through the cation-selective paracellular pathway (i.e., tight junctions) to join the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secreted into the lumen. Water also moves through this paracellular pathway, as well as via aquaporin water channels on the apical and basolateral membranes. Therefore, the net effect of these acinar cell transport processes is the production of an isotonic, NaCl rich fluid that accounts for $\sim 25 \%$ of total pancreatic fluid secretion.

Like the secretion of protein by acinar cells, secretion of fluid and electrolytes is stimulated by secretagogues that raise $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. In the pancreas, activation of muscarinic receptors by cholinergic neural pathways and activation of CCK receptors by humoral pathways increase the membrane conductance of the acinar cell. A similar effect is seen with GRP. Apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels and basolateral membrane $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels appear to be the effector targets of the activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of these channels by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent kinases is one likely mechanism that

cAMP can also activate the EPAC/RAP1 pathways, but the physiologic consequences of such activation have not been defined. RAP1 is a small Ras-like GTPase. EPAC is the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAP1 (see p. 56).

## N43-4 $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$Secretion into Pancreatic Secretory Vesicles

## Contributed by Fred Gorelick

As we have seen in the text (see p. 882), the secretory vesicles in the pancreatic acinar cell fuse with the apical membrane in the process of exocytosis. In the process, these cells release their protein into the lumen of the acinus.

Before the exocytotic event, these secretory vesicles, vacuolar-type $H$ pumps in the vesicle membrane, use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to transport $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cytosol to the lumen of the vesicle. This transport process sets up both a chemical gradient for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(inside acid) and an electrical gradient (inside positive) across the vesicle membrane. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels in the vesicle membrane can then allow $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to flow into the vesicle lumen, in parallel with the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, so that the overall process is HCl movement from cytosol to vesicle lumen. Water follows by osmosis.

The above "secretion" of minute amounts of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the secretory vesicle may contribute to the hydration of proteins within the granule before vesicle fusion.

underlies the increase in open channel probability that accompanies stimulation.

## PANCREATIC DUCT CELL

## The pancreatic duct cell secretes isotonic $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$

The principal physiological function of the pancreatic duct cell is to secrete an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich fluid that alkalinizes and hydrates the protein-rich primary secretions of the acinar cell. The apical step of transepithelial $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion (Fig. 43-6) is mediated in part by a $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger, a member of the SLC26 family (see Table 5-4) that secretes intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the duct lumen. Luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$must be available for this exchange process to occur. Although some luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is present in the primary secretions of the acinar cell, anion channels on the apical membrane of the duct cell provide additional $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to the lumen in a process called $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ recycling. The most important of these anion channels is the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator
(CFTR), a cAMP-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel that is present on the apical membrane of pancreatic duct cells (see p. 120, Box 43-1). $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$recycling is facilitated by the coactivation of CFTR and SLC26 exchangers through direct protein-protein interactions. In some species, such as the rat and mouse, pancreatic duct cells also contain a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel on the apical membrane; this channel also provides $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$to the lumen for recycling. Apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, including CFTR, may also directly serve as conduits for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$movement from the duct cell to the lumen.

The intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that exits the duct cell across the apical membrane arises from two pathways. (5) N43-5 The first is direct uptake of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$via an electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter (NBCe1-B or SLC4A4; see p. 122), which presumably operates with an $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of $1: 2$. The second mechanism is the generation of intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase (see p. 630).The $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$in this reaction, along with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, is derived from $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Thus, the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that accumulates in the cell must be extruded across the basolateral membrane. One

# N43-5 $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Secretion by the Pancreatic Duct 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The current model for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by the pancreatic duct is very similar to that outlined in Figure 43-6. However, we can now add some important details about the apical step of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. The $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger at the apical membrane is a member of the SLC26 family (Mount and Romero, 2004)—previously known as the SAT family—specifically, SLC26A6 (also known as CFEX). We now appreciate that SLC26A6, which is capable of exchanging several different anions (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, oxalate), is electrogenic (Jiang et al, 2002). When mediating $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange, it appears that SLC26A6 exchanges two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions for every $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion. This stoichiometry would strongly favor the efflux of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$across the apical membrane of the pancreatic duct cell.

As noted in the text, the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$that enters the cell via SLC26A exits the cell via apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, principally CFTR. Interestingly, it appears that an interaction between the SLC26A6 protein and CFTR greatly increases the open probability of CFTR (Ko et al, 2004).

Another member of the SLC26 family—SLC26A3—also is present in the apical membrane of pancreatic duct cells. SLC26A3 is also electrogenic but has a stoichiometry opposite to that of SLCA6, two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions for every $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This transporter would extrude $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(and take up $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) from the duct cell across the apical membrane. Its physiological function might be to reabsorb $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at times when the duct is not secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or to contribute to the recycling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$when the duct is secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

# BOX 43-1 Cystic Fibrosis 

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal genetic disease in people of European descent, in whom it affects $\sim 1$ in 2000. Approximately 1 in 20 white individuals carry the autosomal recessive genetic defect. Clinically, CF is characterized by progressive pancreatic and pulmonary insufficiency resulting from the complications of organ obstruction by thickened secretions. The disease results from mutations in the $C F$ gene (located on chromosome 7) that alter the function of its product, CFTR (see Fig 5-10). CFTR is a cAMP-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel that is present on the apical plasma membrane of many epithelial cells. In the pancreas, CFTR has been localized to the apical membrane of duct cells, where it functions to provide the luminal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$exchange (see Fig. 43-6).

Most CF gene mutations result in the production of a CFTR protein that is abnormally folded after its synthesis in the ER. The ER quality-control system recognizes these molecules as defective, and most mutant CFTR molecules are prematurely degraded before they reach the plasma membrane. Subsequent loss of CFTR expression at the plasma membrane disrupts the apical transport processes of the duct cell and results in decreased secretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and water by the ducts. As a result, proteinrich primary (acinar) secretions thicken within the duct lumen and lead to ductal obstruction and eventual tissue destruction. Pathologically, the ducts appear dilated and obstructed, and fibrotic tissue and fat gradually replace the pancreatic parenchymahence the original designation of cystic fibrosis. The subsequent deficiency of pancreatic enzymes that occurs leads to the maldigestion of nutrients and thus the excretion of fat in the stool (steatorrhea) by patients with CF. Before the development of oral enzyme replacement therapy, many patients with CF died of complications of malnutrition.

Now, the major cause of morbidity and mortality in CF is progressive pulmonary disease. The pathophysiology of lung disease in CF is more complex than that of pancreatic disease. A major finding is that the airway mucus is thick and viscous as a result of insufficient fluid secretion into the airway lumen. The pulmonary epithelium probably both secretes fluid (in a mechanism that requires CFTR) and absorbs fluid (in a mechanism that requires apical ENaC Na ${ }^{+}$channels). In CF, the reduced activity of CFTR shifts the balance more toward absorption, and a thick mucous layer is generated that inhibits the ciliary clearance of foreign bodies (see p. 600). The results are an increased rate and severity of infections and thus inflammatory processes that contribute to the destructive process in the lung.

Pulmonary symptoms most commonly bring the patient to the physician's attention in early childhood. Cough and recurrent respiratory infections that are difficult to eradicate are usually the first indications of the illness. The child's sputum is particularly thick and viscous. Pulmonary function progressively declines over the ensuing years, and patients may also experience frequent and severe infections, atelectasis (collapse of lung parenchyma), bronchiectasis (chronic dilatation of the bronchi), and recurrent pneumothoraces (air in the intrapleural space). In addition to the pancreatic and pulmonary manifestations, CF also causes a characteristic increase in the $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ of sweat, which is intermediate in heterozygotes. Pharmacological approaches that bypass the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-transport defect in a lung with CF are currently being evaluated, and considerable effort is being directed toward the development of in vivo gene-transfer techniques to correct the underlying genetic defect.
mechanism of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$extrusion is $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange. The second mechanism for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$extrusion across the basolateral membrane, at least in some species, is an ATP-dependent H pump. Pancreatic duct cells contain acidic intracellular vesicles (presumably containing vacuolar-type H pumps) that are mobilized to the basolateral membrane of the cell after stimulation by secretin, a powerful secretagogue (see below). Indeed, H pumps are most active under conditions of neurohumoral stimulation. Thus, three basolateral transporters directly or indirectly provide the intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that pancreatic duct cells need for secretion: (1) the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter, (2) the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger, and (3) the H pump. The physiological importance of these three acidbase transporters in humans has yet to be fully established. The pancreatic duct cell accounts for $\sim 75 \%$ of total pancreatic fluid secretion.

## Secretin (via cAMP) and ACh (via $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) stimulate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion by pancreatic ducts

When stimulated, the epithelial cells of the pancreatic duct secrete an isotonic $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ solution. The duct cells have receptors for secretin, ACh, GRP (all of which stimulate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion), and substance P (which inhibits it). CCK may also modulate ductular secretory processes.

Secretin is the most important humoral regulator of ductal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. Activation of the secretin receptor
on the duct cell stimulates adenylyl cyclase, which raises [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$. Because forskolin and cAMP analogs stimulate ductal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion, the secretin response has been attributed to its effect on [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$ and activation of PKA. However, even low concentrations of secretin that do not measurably increase [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$ can stimulate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. This observation suggests that the secretin response may be mediated by (1) unmeasurably small increases in total cellular cAMP, (2) cAMP increases that are localized to small intracellular compartments, or (3) activation of alternative second-messenger pathways. Secretin acts by stimulating the apical CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel and the basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter without affecting the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger.
$\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion is also regulated by the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (see pp. 341-342). The postganglionic parasympathetic neurotransmitter ACh, acting through muscarinic receptors on the duct cell, increases $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and activates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent protein kinases (PKC and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinases). The ACh effect is inhibited by atropine. Although ductular secretion in the rat is also stimulated by GRP, the second messenger mediating this effect is not known. In the duct cell, unlike in the acinar cell, GRP does not increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, GRP also does not raise [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$.

In the rat, both basal and stimulated ductular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion is inhibited by substance $\mathbf{P}$. The second messenger

mediating this effect is also unknown. Because substance P inhibits $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion regardless of whether the secretagogue is secretin, ACh, or GRP-which apparently act via three different signal-transduction mechanisms-substance P probably acts at a site that is distal to the generation of second messengers, such as by inhibiting the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger.

## Apical membrane chloride channels are important sites of neurohumoral regulation

In the regulation of pancreatic duct cells by the neurohumoral mechanisms just discussed, the only effector proteins that have been identified as targets of the protein kinases and phosphatases are the apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels, and $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter. CFTR functions as a low-conductance apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (see p. 120). CFTR has nucleotide-binding domains that control channel opening and closing as well as a regulatory domain with multiple potential PKA and PKC phosphorylation sites. Neurohumoral agents that control fluid and electrolyte secretion by the pancreatic duct cells act at this site. Agents that activate PKA are the most important regulators of CFTR function. PKC activation enhances the stimulatory effect of PKA on CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transport, but alone it appears to have little direct effect on CFTR function. Thus, the CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel is regulated by ATP through two types of mechanisms: interaction with the nucleotide-binding domains and protein phosphorylation (see Fig. 5-10). 0 N5-16

In addition to CFTR, pancreatic duct cells in some species have $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels ( CaCCs ) on the apical membrane. Not only does $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ directly stimulate CaCCs , but cAMP may indirectly stimulate CaCCs by stimulating CFTR, which somehow promotes ATP efflux. Luminal ATP would then bind to an apical purinergic receptor, leading to the influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and thus activation of CaCCs in an autocrine/ paracrine fashion (see Fig. 43-6).

In rat pancreatic duct cells, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-sensitive basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels seem to be targets of neurohumoral stimulation. Activators of the cAMP pathway stimulate phosphorylation by PKA, thus enhancing the responsiveness of these channels to $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and increasing their probability of being open.

## Pancreatic duct cells may also secrete glycoproteins

Although the primary function of the pancreatic duct cells is to secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and water, these cells may also synthesize and secrete various high-molecular-weight proteoglycans. Some of these proteins are structurally distinct from the mucin that is produced by the specialized goblet cells in the duct. Unlike the proteins that are secreted by acinar cells, the glycoproteins synthesized in duct cells are not accumulated in large secretion granules. Rather, they appear to be continuously synthesized and secreted from small cytoplasmic vesicles. Secretin increases the secretion of glycoproteins from these cells, but this action appears to result from stimulation of glycoprotein synthesis, rather than from stimulation of vesicular transport or exocytosis itself. The role of these proteins may be to protect against protease-mediated injury to mucosal cells.

## COMPOSITION, FUNCTION, AND CONTROL OF PANCREATIC SECRETION

## Pancreatic juice is a protein-rich, alkaline secretion

Humans produce $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of pancreatic fluid each day. The pancreas has the highest rates of protein synthesis and secretion of any organ in the body. Each day the pancreas delivers between 15 and 100 g of protein into the small intestine. The level of pancreatic secretion is determined by a balance between factors that stimulate secretion and those that inhibit it.

The human pancreas secretes $>20$ proteins, some of which are listed in Table 43-1. Most of these proteins are either inactive digestive enzyme precursors-zymogens-or active digestive enzymes. The secretory proteins responsible for digestion can be classified according to their substrates: proteases hydrolyze proteins, amylases digest carbohydrates, lipases and phospholipases break down lipids, and nucleases digest nucleic acids. The functions of other secretory proteins-such as glycoprotein II (GP2), lithostathine, and pancreatitis-associated protein-are less well defined.

GP2 is an unusual protein with an N-terminal glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety that links it to the inner leaflet of the zymogen granule membrane. GP2 has been implicated in the regulation of endocytosis. After exocytosis, luminal cleavage of the GP2 linkage to the zymogen granule membrane seems to be necessary for proper trafficking of the zymogen granule membrane back into the cell from the plasma membrane. Under certain circumstances, the released GP2-and also lithostathine-may form protein aggregates in the pancreatic juice. This finding is not

surprising inasmuch as GP2 is structurally related to the Tamm-Horsfall protein, which is secreted by the renal thick ascending limb (see pp. 729-730). The tendency of GP2 and lithostathine to form aggregates may have detrimental clinical consequences in that both proteins have been implicated in the pathological formation of protein plugs that can obstruct the lumen of acini in patients with cystic fibrosis (see Box 43-1) and chronic pancreatitis.

Pancreatitis-associated protein is a secretory protein that is present in low concentrations in the normal state. However, levels of this protein may increase up to several hundred-fold during the early phases of pancreatic injury. Pancreatitis-associated protein is a bacteriostatic agent that may help to prevent pancreatic infection during bouts of pancreatitis.

Pancreatic juice is also rich in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Calcium concentrations are in the millimolar range inside the organelles of the secretory pathway of the acinar cells, but lower in pancreatic secretions after dilution by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-free duct secretions. These high levels of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the vesicles may be required to induce the aggregation of secretory proteins and to direct them into the secretory pathway. Bicarbonate secreted by duct cells neutralizes the acidic gastric secretions that enter the duodenum and allows digestive enzymes to function properly; $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$also facilitates the micellar solubilization of lipids and mucosal cell function. The $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$in pancreatic juice increases with increases in the secretory flow rate (Fig. 43-7). In the unstimulated state, the flow is low, and the electrolyte composition of pancreatic juice closely resembles that of blood plasma. As the gland is stimulated and flow increases, exchange of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in the pancreatic juice for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ across the apical membrane of the duct cells produces a secretory product that is more alkaline ( pH of $\sim 8.1$ ) and has a lower $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$. Concentrations of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, however, are not significantly altered by changes in flow.

## In the fasting state, levels of secreted pancreatic enzymes oscillate at low levels

Pancreatic secretion is regulated in both the fasted and fed states. Under basal conditions, the pancreas releases low levels of pancreatic enzymes (Fig. 43-8). However, during the digestive period (eating a meal), pancreatic secretion increases in sequential phases to levels that are 5- to 20 -fold

Figure 43-8 Time course of pancreatic secretion during fasting and feeding. The interdigestive output of secretory products (e.g., trypsin) by the pancreas varies cyclically and in rough synchrony with the four phases of motor activity (migrating motor complexes) of the small intestine, shown by the colored vertical bands. Feeding causes a massive and sustained increase in trypsin release and switches small-intestinal motility to the fed state. (Data from DiMagno EP, Layer P: In Go VLW, DiMagno EP, Gardner JD, et al [eds]: The Pancreas: Biology, Pathobiology and Disease, 2nd ed. New York, Raven Press, pp 275-300, 1993.)

higher than basal levels. The systems that regulate secretion appear to be redundant; if one system fails, a second takes its place. These mechanisms ensure that the release of pancreatic enzymes corresponds to the amount of food in the small intestine.

Like other organs in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the pancreas has a basal rate of secretion even when food is not being eaten or digested. During this interdigestive (fasting) period, pancreatic secretions vary cyclically and correspond to sequential changes in the motility of the small intestine (see p. 861). Pancreatic secretion is minimal when intestinal motility is in its quiescent phase (phase I); biliary and gastric secretions are also minimal at this time. As duodenal motility increases (phase II), so does pancreatic secretion. During the interdigestive period, enzyme secretion is maximal when intestinal motility-the migrating motor complexes (MMCs; see Fig 41-6)—is also maximal (phase III). However, even this maximal interdigestive secretory rate is only $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of that stimulated by a meal. The peak phases of interdigestive intestinal motor activity and pancreatic secretory activity are followed by a declining period (phase IV). Fluid and electrolyte secretion rates during the interdigestive phase are usually $<5 \%$ of maximum levels.

The cyclic pattern of interdigestive pancreatic secretion is mediated by intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms. The predominant mechanism of pancreatic regulation is through parasympathetic pathways. Telenzepine, an antagonist of the $\mathrm{M}_{1}$ muscarinic ACh receptor, reduces interdigestive enzyme secretion by $>85 \%$ during phases II and III. Although cholinergic pathways are the major regulators of interdigestive pancreatic secretion, CCK and adrenergic pathways also play a role. CCK appears to stimulate pancreatic enzyme secretion during phases I and II. In contrast, basal $\alpha$ adrenergic tone appears to suppress interdigestive pancreatic secretion. Although human and canine pancreas denervated during transplantation exhibits cyclic secretion, this secretion is no longer synchronous with duodenal motor activity. These observations support a role for the autonomic nervous system in regulating basal (resting) pancreatic secretion.

## CCK from duodenal I cells stimulates acinar enzyme secretion, and secretin from $S$ cells stimulates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and fluid secretion by ducts

CCK plays a central role in regulating pancreatic secretion. CCK is released from neuroendocrine cells (I cells; see Table 41-1) present in the duodenal mucosa (see Fig. 43-4). In response to a meal, plasma CCK levels increase 5- to 10-fold within 10 to 30 minutes.

The most potent stimulator of CCK release from I cells is lipid in the duodenal lumen. Protein digestive products (i.e., peptones, amino acids) also increase CCK release, but carbohydrate and acid have little effect. CCK secretion may also be stimulated by CCK-releasing factors, which are peptides released by mucosal cells of the duodenum or secreted by the pancreas. The level of these releasing factors may reflect a balance between the relative amounts of nutrients and digestive enzymes that are present in the gut lumen at any one time, so the level of the factors reflects the digestive milieu of the duodenum. In the fasting state, luminal

CCK-releasing factors are degraded by digestive enzymes that accompany basal pancreatic secretion, so little releasing factor remains to stimulate the I cells. However, during a meal, the digestive enzymes are diverted to the digestion of ingested nutrients entering the gut lumen, and the CCKreleasing factors are spared degradation. Hence, the relative level of proteins to proteases in the small intestine determines the amount of CCK-releasing factor available to drive CCK release and thus pancreatic secretion.

Three lines of evidence show that CCK is a physiological mediator of pancreatic protein secretion: (1) CCK levels increase in the serum in response to a meal, (2) administration of exogenous CCK at the same levels produced by a meal stimulates pancreatic protein secretion to higher levels than those generated by a meal (the meal may also stimulate the release of inhibitory factors in addition to CCK), and (3) a specific CCK inhibitor reduces pancreatic protein secretion by $>50 \%$.

CCK may act on the acinar cell through both direct and indirect pathways: it can directly stimulate enzyme secretion through a $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptor on the acinar cell (see Fig. 43-4), and it may indirectly stimulate enzyme secretion by activating the parasympathetic (cholinergic) nervous system. However, whether human acinar cells have $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptors remains unclear. As we see below (see pp. 890-892), the parasympathetic pathway plays a major role in mediating the intestinal phase of pancreatic secretion. Vagal stimulation can drive pancreatic secretion to nearly maximum levels. Atropine, an antagonist of muscarinic ACh receptors (see pp. 341-342), reduces the secretion of enzymes and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ during the intestinal phase of a meal. Atropine also inhibits secretion in response to stimulation by physiological levels of exogenous CCK. Together, these findings suggest that CCK somehow stimulates the parasympathetic pathway, which in turn stimulates muscarinic receptors on the acinar cell but may have little direct effect on human acinar cells.

Like CCK, GRP-which is structurally related to bombesin-may also be a physiological regulator of pancreatic enzyme secretion. Stimulation of acinar cells with GRP leads to enzyme secretion. In contrast to the hormone CCK, the major source of GRP appears to be the vagal nerve terminals.

Secretin is the most potent humoral stimulator of fluid and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by the pancreas (see Fig. 43-6). Secretin is released from neuroendocrine cells ( S cells) in the mucosa of the small intestine in response to duodenal acidification and, to a lesser extent, bile acids and lipids. To stimulate secretin secretion, duodenal pH must fall to $<4.5$. Like CCK levels, secretin levels increase after the ingestion of a meal. However, when these levels are reached experimentally by administration of exogenous secretin, pancreatic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion is less than that generated by a meal. These findings suggest that secretin is acting in concert with CCK, ACh, and other agents to stimulate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion.

In addition to hormones of intestinal origin, insulin and other hormones secreted by the islets of Langerhans within the pancreas (see p. 1035) may also influence pancreatic exocrine secretion. Blood flow from the pancreatic islets moves to the exocrine pancreas through a portal system. This organization allows high concentrations of islet hormones to interact with pancreatic acinar cells. One result of this

| Intestinal | Amino acids <br> Fatty acids <br> $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ | CCK <br> Secretin <br> Enteropancreatic <br> reflexes | $50-80$ |

arrangement may be that insulin modifies the composition of digestive enzymes within the acinar cell and increases the relative levels of amylase. Islet hormones may also have trophic effects on the exocrine pancreas and stimulate its growth. As a reflection of this function, the mass of the exocrine pancreas is substantially reduced in individuals with diabetes.

Regulation of exocrine pancreatic secretion is complex, and understanding this process has been made difficult by the following: (1) tissue levels of an exogenously infused hormone may not match those generated physiologically; (2) because several neurohumoral factors are released in response to a meal, the infusion of a single agent may not accurately reflect its physiological role; (3) specific neurohumoral inhibitors are often unavailable; and (4) pancreatic responses may differ depending on the species.

## A meal triggers cephalic, gastric, and intestinal phases of pancreatic secretion

The digestive period has been divided into three phases (Table 43-2) based on the site at which food acts to stimulate pancreatic secretion, just as for gastric secretion (see pp. 870-872). These three phases (cephalic, gastric, and intestinal) are sequential and follow the progression of a meal from its initial smell and taste to its movement through the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 43-9). These phases act in a coordinated fashion to maximize efficiency of the digestive process. For example, stimulation of secretion before the entry of food into the small intestine during the cephalic and gastric phases ensures that active enzymes are present when food arrives. Conversely, suppression of secretion during the late digestive phase suppresses the release of pancreatic enzymes when nutrients are no longer present in the proximal end of the small intestine.

Cephalic Phase During the cephalic phase, the sight, taste, and smell of food usually generates only a modest increase in fluid and electrolyte secretion (see Fig. 43-9A). However, these factors have prominent effects on enzyme secretion. In most animal species, enzyme secretion increases to $25 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the maximum rate evoked by exogenous CCK. In humans, the cephalic phase is short-lived and
dissipates rapidly when food is removed. The cephalic phase is mediated by neural pathways. In the dog, stimulation of several regions of the hypothalamus (the dorsomedial and ventromedial nuclei and the mammillary body) enhances pancreatic secretion. The efferent signal travels along vagal pathways to stimulate pancreatic secretion via ACh , an effect blocked by atropine. The cephalic phase does not depend on gastrin or CCK release, but it is probably mediated by the stimulation of muscarinic receptors on the acinar cell.

Gastric Phase During the gastric phase (see Figure 43-9A), the presence of food in the stomach modulates pancreatic secretion by (1) affecting the release of hormones, (2) stimulating neural pathways, and (3) modifying the pH and availability of nutrients in the proximal part of the small intestine. The presence of specific peptides or amino acids (peptones) stimulates gastrin release from G cells in the antrum of the stomach and, to a much lesser extent, G cells in the proximal part of the duodenum. The gastrin/CCK ${ }_{2}$ receptor and the $\mathrm{CCK}_{1}$ receptor are closely related (see p. 867). Although in some species the gastrin/CCK ${ }_{2}$ receptor is not present on the pancreatic acinar cell, gastrin can still act-albeit not as well-through the CCK ${ }_{1}$ receptor. Although physiological concentrations of gastrin can stimulate pancreatic secretion in some species, the importance of gastrin in regulating secretion in the human pancreas remains unclear. As far as local neural pathways are concerned, gastric distention stimulates low levels of pancreatic secretion, probably through a vagovagal gastropancreatic reflex. Although the presence of food in the stomach affects pancreatic secretion, the most important role for chyme in controlling pancreatic secretion occurs after the gastric contents enter the small intestine.

Intestinal Phase During the intestinal phase, chyme entering the proximal region of the small intestine stimulates a major pancreatic secretory response by three major mechanisms (see Fig. 43-9B). First, gastric acid entering the duodenum-and to a lesser extent, bile acids and lipidsstimulate duodenal $\mathbf{S}$ cells to release secretin, which stimulates duct cells to secrete $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and fluid. A threshold duodenal pH of $<4.5$ is needed to activate S-cell secretion. The acid stimulates fluid and electrolyte secretion to a greater extent than it stimulates protein secretion. Second, lipids and, to a lesser degree, peptones stimulate duodenal I cells to release CCK, which stimulates acinar cells to release digestive enzymes. Finally, the same stimuli that trigger I cells also activate a vagovagal enteropancreatic reflex that predominantly stimulates acinar cells.

The pattern of enzyme secretion-mediated by the CCK and vagovagal pathways-depends on the contents of the meal. For example, a liquid meal elicits a response that is only $\sim 60 \%$ of maximal. In contrast, a solid meal, which contains larger particles and is slowly released from the stomach, elicits a prolonged response. Meals rich in calories cause the greatest response.

The chemistry of the ingested nutrients also affects pancreatic secretion via the CCK and vagovagal pathways. For example, perfusion of the duodenum with carbohydrates has little effect on secretion, whereas lipids are potent stimulators of pancreatic enzyme secretion. As far as lipids are

concerned, triglycerides do not stimulate pancreatic secretion, but their hydrolytic products-monoglycerides and fatty acids-do. The longer the chain length of the fatty acid, the greater the secretory response; C-18 fatty acids generate protein secretion that is near the maximum produced by
exogenous CCK. Some fatty acids also stimulate pancreatic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion. Because fatty acids also reduce gastric acid secretion and delay gastric emptying, they may play an important role in modulating pH conditions in the proximal part of the small intestine. Protein breakdown products are

intermediate in their stimulatory effect. Nonessential amino acids have little effect on protein secretion, whereas some essential amino acids (see Table 58-2) stimulate secretion. The most potent amino-acid stimulators are phenylalanine, valine, and methionine. Short peptides containing phenylalanine stimulate secretion to the same extent as the amino acid itself. Because gastric digestion generates more peptides than amino acids, it is likely that peptides provide the initial pancreatic stimulation during the intestinal phase.

The relative potency of the different nutrients in stimulating secretion is inversely related to the pancreatic reserves of digestive enzymes. Thus, the pancreas needs to release only a small portion of its amylase to digest the carbohydrate in a meal and to release only slightly greater portions of proteolytic enzymes to digest the proteins. However, a greater fraction of pancreatic lipase has to be released to efficiently digest the fat in most meals. The exocrine pancreas has the ability to respond to long-term changes in dietary composition by modulating the reserves of pancreatic enzymes. For example, a diet that is relatively high in carbohydrates may lead to a relative increase in pancreatic amylase content.

## The pancreas has large reserves of digestive enzymes for carbohydrates and proteins, but not for lipids

The exocrine pancreas stores more enzymes than are required for digesting a meal. The greatest pancreatic reserves are those required for carbohydrate and protein digestion. The reserves of enzymes required for lipid digestion-particularly for triglyceride hydrolysis-are more limited. Even so, nutrient absorption studies after partial pancreatic resection show that maldigestion of dietary fat does not occur until $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the pancreas has been removed. Similar reserves exist for pancreatic endocrine function. These observations have important clinical implications because they indicate that individuals can tolerate large pancreatic resections for tumors without fear of developing maldigestion or diabetes postoperatively. When fat maldigestion or diabetes does develop because of pancreatic disease, the gland must have undergone extensive destruction. (5) N43-6

## Fat in the distal part of the small intestine inhibits pancreatic secretion

Once maximally stimulated, pancreatic secretion begins to decrease after several hours. Nevertheless, the levels of secretion remain adequate for digestion. Regulatory systems only gradually return secretion to its basal (interdigestive) state. The regulatory mechanisms responsible for this feedback inhibition are less well characterized than those responsible for stimulating pancreatic secretion. The presence of fat in the distal end of the small intestine reduces pancreatic secretion in most animals, including humans. This inhibition may be mediated by peptide YY (PYY), which is present in neuroendocrine cells in the ileum and colon. PYY may suppress pancreatic secretion by acting on inhibitory neural pathways as well as by decreasing pancreatic blood flow. Somatostatin (particularly SS-28; see pp. 993-994), released from intestinal D cells, and glucagon, released from pancreatic islet $\alpha$ cells, may also be factors in returning pancreatic secretion to the interdigestive state after a meal.

TABLE 43-3 Mechanisms that Protect the Acinar Cell from Autodigestion

| PROTECTIVE FACTOR | MECHANISM |
| :--: | :--: |
| Packaging of many digestive proteins as zymogens | Precursor proteins lack enzymatic activity |
| Selective sorting of secretory proteins and storage in zymogen granules | Restricts the interaction of secretory proteins with other cellular compartments |
| Protease inhibitors in the zymogen granule | Block the action of prematurely activated enzymes |
| Condensation of secretory proteins at low pH | Limits the activity of active enzymes |
| Nondigestive proteases | Degrade active enzymes |

## Several mechanisms protect the pancreas from autodigestion

Premature activation of pancreatic enzymes within acinar cells may lead to autodigestion and could play a role in initiating pancreatitis. (5) N43-1 To avoid such injury, the acinar cell has mechanisms for preventing enzymatic activity (Table 43-3). First, many digestive proteins are stored in secretory granules as inactive precursors or zymogens. Under normal conditions, zymogens become activated only after entering the small intestine. There, the intestinal enzyme enterokinase converts trypsinogen to trypsin (see pp. 921-922), which initiates the conversion of all other zymogens to their active forms. Second, the secretory granule membrane is impermeable to proteins. Thus, the zymogens and active digestive enzymes are sequestered from proteins in the cytoplasm and other intracellular compartments. Third, enzyme inhibitors such as pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, co-packaged in the secretory granule, block the activity of trypsin aberrantly activated within the granule. However, sufficient pancreatic trypsin inhibitor is present in the secretory granules to block $<5 \%$ of the potential trypsin activity. Fourth, the condensation of zymogens, the low pH , and the ionic conditions within the secretory pathway may further limit enzyme activity. Fifth, enzymes that become prematurely active within the acinar cell may themselves be degraded by other enzymes or be secreted before they can cause injury.

Degradation of prematurely active enzymes may be mediated by other enzymes that are present within the secretory granule or by the mixing of secretory granule contents with lysosomal enzymes that can degrade active enzymes. Three mechanisms lead to the mixing of digestive proteases and lysosomal enzymes: (1) lysosomal enzymes may be co-packaged in the secretory granule; (2) secretory granules may selectively fuse with lysosomes (a process called crinophagy); and (3) secretory granules, as well as other organelles, may be engulfed by lysosomes (a process called autophagy). Failure of these protective mechanisms may result in the premature activation of digestive enzymes within the pancreatic acinar cell and may initiate pancreatitis (Box 43-2). (5) N43-7

## N43-6 Chronic Pancreatitis and Pancreatic Insufficiency

## Contributed by Fred Gorelick

Chronic pancreatitis is a localized and chronic inflammation of the pancreas. The most common causes are many years (10 to 20) of alcohol abuse or smoking. The clinical manifestations of chronic pancreatitis usually begin with chronic epigastric pain that radiates into the back, then progress to include calcification of the pancreas and progressive loss of the endocrine and exocrine tissues. The destruction of pancreatic tissues leads to diabetes and loss of nutrients (malabsorption). A distinct pattern of malabsorption is seen with chronic pancreatitis: individuals lose large amounts of dietary fat but have little loss of protein or carbohydrates. This type of malabsorption can cause fat droplets to appear in the patient's stool; this symptom is a strong clinical clue that a patient is not absorbing dietary lipids. An important reason for the selective loss of lipids is the shortage of lipase and its cofactors compared to other classes of digestive enzymes. This happens because the pancreatic reserves of lipase are very limited and because lipase is very sensitive to an acid environment. Lipase is the only major pancreatic enzyme that become irreversibly inactive at $\mathrm{pH}<4.0$.

Although the pain of chronic pancreatitis can be difficult to treat, the malabsorption of lipids is very amenable to therapy. This involves giving exogenous pancreatic enzymes (usually extracted from porcine pancreas) by mouth with each meal. However, the critical lipase in these preparations must be protected from an acidic environment. This is done by either raising the pH of the stomach using inhibitors of acid secretion (see pp. 865-866) or encasing the enzyme in a coating that dissolves only when the preparation has reached the high-pH environment of the small intestine.

## N43-7 Hereditary Pancreatitis

## Contributed by Fred Gorelick

A rare form of pancreatitis that provides insights into the mechanisms of disease is hereditary pancreatitis. This is an autosomal dominant disease with incomplete penetrance: only about $80 \%$ of those carrying disease mutations have clinical disease. Symptoms of pancreatitis often begin in childhood but may be delayed until early adulthood. Often individuals first experience bouts of pain and then develop the other features of chronic pancreatitis, especially pancreatic calcifications, early in the course of disease. There are no treatments that prevent disease progression. One of the unfortunate features of this disease is the increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer ( $35 \%$ to $55 \%$ lifetime risk versus $1.5 \%$ in the general population, or about a 30 -fold increase). The genetic defect in hereditary pancreatitis is found in the gene encoding for cationic trypsinogen. Although a number of genetic defects, including those in CFTR and the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor, can predispose to developing pancreatitis, the mutations in cationic trypsinogen found in hereditary pancreatitis are the only ones that alone cause disease. Although mutations at several sites within the gene have been described, the most common involve a mutation that exchanges a histidine for an arginine residue. This removes a potential cleavage site for serine proteases. Cleavage of cationic trypsin at this site would eliminate the catalytic activity of the enzyme. Such proteolysis of activated enzymes within the acinar cell likely represents a major protective mechanism. Indeed, inactivating mutations in several proteases that degrade trypsin, including chymotrypsin C, increase the risk of developing pancreatitis. Other mutations in cationic trypsinogen can also cause pancreatitis and may have this damaging effect by either increasing the efficiency of cationic trypsinogen activation or causing the enzyme to misfold and trigger an ER stress response.

## SALIVARY ACINAR CELL

## Different salivary acinar cells secrete different proteins

The organizational structure of the salivary glands (Fig. 43-10A) is similar to that of the pancreas (see Fig. 43-1A), with secretory acinar units draining into progressively larger ducts. Unlike the pancreas, the salivary glands are
heterogeneous in distribution and, in some species, contain two morphologically distinct acinar cell populations that synthesize and secrete different protein products. The acinar cells of the parotid glands in most species secrete a serous (i.e., watery) product that contains an abundance of $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-amylase. Many acinar cells of the sublingual glands secrete a mucinous product that is composed primarily of mucin

# BOX 43-2 Genetic Causes of Acute and Chronic Pancreatitis 

Single genetic factors rarely cause pancreatitis but can work in combination with other genetic or environmental factors to increase disease risk. Most of the genetic factors associated with pancreatitis involve digestive enzymes. Of these, the majority are thought to lead to an increase in trypsin activity in the acinar cell. The first described was hereditary pancreatitis, in which mutations in a single gene are sufficient to cause the syndrome. ( $\$ N43-7 In hereditary pancreatitis, various mutations in cationic trypsinogen are thought to enhance either the sensitivity of the zymogen (cationic trypsinogen) to activation or the resistance of the active form (trypsin) to degradation.

Predisposing factors for pancreatitis include a high degree of trypsin activation, a low level of pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, and low activity of enzymes that degrade trypsin. All three factors determine the levels of active trypsin in the acinar cell, and mutations are known in proteins that regulate the latter two mechanisms. Mutations of a secretory pancreatic trypsin inhibitor-serine
protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1, or SPINK1-which is co-packaged with trypsinogen in the secretory pathway, increase the risk of developing pancreatitis, but alone do not cause disease. Mutations in chymotrypsin C, a protease that degrades aberrantly activated trypsin in the pancreatic acinar cell, also predisposes to disease. It appears to particularly sensitize those who abuse alcohol.

Although classic cystic fibrosis generally results in pancreatic insufficiency at birth and not pancreatitis, mild mutations in CFTR that result in mild defects in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance ( $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of normal) are a risk factor for developing pancreatitis. These can act in concert with alcohol abuse and SPINK mutations to increase disease risk further. One feature of alcoholassociated pancreatitis is the low risk of developing disease ( $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ ) in abusers, which is consistent with the idea that other genetic or environmental factors must contribute to the disease risk.

## A ORGANIZATION OF THE SALIVARY GLANDS

![bo424869338f](bo424869338f.jpg)

Figure 43-10 Salivary gland distribution and cellular morphology. A, Humans have three main bilateral salivary glands. The parotid glands are located in front of each ear, the submandibular glands are located laterally beneath each jaw bone, and the sublingual glands are located in the floor of the mouth, underneath both sides of the tongue.

TABLE 43-4 Autonomic Control of Salivary Secretion

| AUTONOMIC PATHWAY | NEUROTRANSMITTER | RECEPTOR | SIGNAUNG PATHWAY | CELLULAR RESPONSE |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Parasympathetic | ACh | Muscarinic $\left(\mathrm{M}_{3}\right)$ | $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ | Fluid > protein secretion |

glycoproteins. Figure 43-10B shows an acinar cell that contains both serous and mucous granules. The submandibular gland of many species contains both mucous-type and serous-type acinar cells. In some species, these two distinct cell types are dispersed throughout the submandibular gland, whereas in other species such as humans, distinct mucous and serous acinar units are the rule. In addition to $\alpha$-amylase and mucin glycoproteins, salivary acinar cells also secrete many proline-rich proteins. Like mucin proteins, proline-rich proteins are highly glycosylated, and like other secreted salivary proteins, they are present in the acinar secretory granules and are released by exocytosis.

## Cholinergic and adrenergic neural pathways are the most important physiological activators of regulated secretion by salivary acinar cells

Unlike the pancreas, in which hormones have an important role in stimulating secretion, the salivary glands are mostly controlled by the autonomic nervous system (see Chapter 14). The major agonists of salivary acinar secretion are ACh and norepinephrine, which are released from postganglionic parasympathetic and sympathetic nerve terminals, respectively (see Fig. 14-8 and Table 43-4). The cholinergic receptor on the salivary acinar cell is the muscarinic $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ glandular subtype. The adrenergic receptors identified on these cells include both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subtypes. Other receptors identified in salivary tissue include those for substance $\mathrm{P}\left(\mathrm{NK}_{1}\right.$ receptors), VIP, purinergic agonists (P2X7 receptors), neurotensin, prostaglandin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF). However, some of these other receptors are found only on specific salivary glands and may be present on duct cells rather than acinar cells. Significant species variation with regard to surface receptor expression is also seen. Thus, for the salivary glands, it is difficult to discuss the regulation of acinar cell secretion in general terms. It is fair to say, however, that both cholinergic and adrenergic neurotransmitters can stimulate exocytosis by salivary acinar cells.

## Both cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ mediate salivary acinar secretion

Protein secretion by the salivary acinar cell, as by the pancreatic acinar cell, is associated with increases in both [cAMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Activation of cAMP via the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor is the most potent stimulator of amylase secretion in the rat parotid gland. Activation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling pathways via the $\alpha$-adrenergic, muscarinic, and substance $P$ receptors also stimulates amylase secretion by the parotid gland, but in general, these $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling pathways have a greater effect on fluid secretion. Increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ cause G protein-dependent activation of PLC and thus lead to
the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG). $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ releases $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores and stimulates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent protein kinases such as PKC (see pp. 60-61) and calmodulin kinase (see p. 60), whereas DAG directly activates PKC (see pp. 60-61). The repetitive spikes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ in salivary acinar cells, as in pancreatic acinar cells, depend on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores (see p. 60) and on the influx of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. ATP co-released with norepinephrine (see pp. 345346) activates a P2X7 receptor, which is a ligand-gated cation-selective channel that allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to enter across the plasma membrane and thus increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$.

Fluid and electrolyte secretion is the second major function of salivary acinar cells, accounting for $\sim 90 \%$ of total salivary volume output under stimulatory conditions. The mechanisms in salivary acinar cells are similar to those in pancreatic acinar cells (see Fig. 43-5). The primary secretion of the salivary acinar cell is isotonic and results largely from the basolateral uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$through $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporters, working in conjunction with $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps and basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Secretion of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and water into the lumen is mediated by apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and aquaporin water channels. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and some water reach the lumen via paracellular routes. The salivary acinar cells in some glands and species express carbonic anhydrase as well as parallel basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers (AE2) and Na-H exchangers (NHE1 and NHE4), as well as electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (NBCe1-B or SLC4A4; see p. 122). These acid-base transporters probably also contribute to the primary secretion.

Stimulation of fluid and electrolyte secretion by salivary acinar cells is largely mediated by cholinergic and $\alpha$ adrenergic input. Substance $P$, acting through its own receptor, also initiates conductance changes in the salivary acinar cell. All these effects seem to be mediated by rises in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels and basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels appear to be the effector targets of the activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling pathway. Phosphorylation of these channels by $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent kinases may affect the probability that these channels will be open and may thus increase conductance.

## SALIVARY DUCT CELL

## Salivary duct cells produce a hypotonic fluid that is poor in NaCl and rich in $\mathrm{KHCO}_{3}$

In the salivary glands, as in the pancreas, the ducts modify the composition of the isotonic, plasma-like primary secretion of the acinar cells. As the fluid exits the salivary acinus, it passes through an intercalated duct (see Fig. 43-10A), with typical intercalated duct cells (see Fig. 43-10C). Later, abundant mitochondria and infoldings of the basolateral

![bo434869338f](bo434869338f.jpg)

Figure 43-11 Salivary duct transporters.
membrane give the basal portion of the duct cells a characteristic striated appearance-hence the term striated duct cell (see Fig. 43-10B). This morphology goes hand in hand with high rates of active transport. In general, salivary duct cells absorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and, to a lesser extent, secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Because the epithelium is not very water permeable, the lumen thus becomes hypotonic. However, significant differences are seen in the various types of salivary glands.

Reabsorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$by salivary duct cells is a two-step transcellular process (Fig. 43-11). First, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$enters the cell from the lumen through apical epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (ENaCs; see Table 6-2, family \#14). Second, the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump extrudes this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Elevated $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, provides feedback inhibition by downregulating ENaC activity, presumably via the ubiquitin-protein ligase Nedd4.

Reabsorption of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$is also a two-step transcellular process (see Fig. 43-11). Entry of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical membrane occurs via a $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger and CFTR. To a certain extent, apical CFTR also recycles $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorbed by the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger. Thus, CFTR may facilitate both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$reabsorption through bidirectional $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ movement across the apical membrane. Exit of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the basolateral membrane of duct cells occurs via inwardly rectifying (CIC-2) $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels.

Secretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$occurs via pathways (see Fig. 43-11) similar to those in pancreatic ducts and involves apical $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers and CFTR, as well as basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters (see p. 122). ( $\bigcirc$ N43-5

Secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$occurs through the basolateral uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$via the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (see Fig. 43-11). The mechanism of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit across the apical membrane is not well established.

## Parasympathetic stimulation decreases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption, whereas aldosterone increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption by duct cells

Regulation of duct cell transport processes is less well understood in the salivary glands than in the pancreas. In the intact salivary gland (i.e., acini and ducts), secretion is stimulated primarily by parasympathetic input via ACh. In the duct cell, cholinergic agonists, acting through muscarinic receptors (mostly $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ ), increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and presumably activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent regulatory pathways. The effector targets of this $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling pathway are not known. The role played by duct cells in the increased saliva production that occurs in response to cholinergic stimulation is limited and may reflect decreased NaCl absorption more than increased $\mathrm{KHCO}_{3}$ secretion.

The specific effects of adrenergic stimulation on the transport activity of duct cells are unclear. Nevertheless, activation of the $\beta$-adrenergic receptor increases [cAMP] $]_{i}$ and activates the CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel.

Salivary duct cell function is also regulated by circulating hormones. The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone stimulates the absorption of NaCl and secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by salivary duct cells in several species. Although its role has not been well examined in salivary duct cells, aldosterone in other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-absorbing epithelia (e.g., kidney and colon) stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transport by increasing both ENaC and $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump activity (see pp. 765-766). Salivary duct cells may also have receptors for certain neuropeptides such as VIP, although their physiological significance remains unknown.

## Salivary duct cells also secrete and take up proteins

Duct cells handle proteins in three ways. Some proteins that are synthesized by duct cells are secreted into the lumen, others are secreted into the blood, and still others are reabsorbed from the lumen to the cell.

Intralobular duct epithelial cells in rodent submandibular glands synthesize a variety of proteins that are stored in intracellular granules and are secreted in response to neurohumoral stimuli. EGF, nerve growth factor, and kallikrein are among the most abundant proteins that are packaged for secretion by these cells. Salivary duct cells may also synthesize, store, and secrete some digestive enzymes ( $\alpha$-amylase and ribonucleases). Degranulation of intralobular duct cells occurs primarily in response to $\alpha$-adrenergic stimulation, which suggests that protein secretion by duct cells is regulated primarily by the sympathetic division.

Although regulatory peptides (i.e., glucagon and somatostatin) have also been detected in salivary duct cells, no evidence indicates that they are stored in granules or are secreted into the lumen (i.e., they may be basolaterally secreted as peptide hormones). In addition, duct cells synthesize polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA) receptors that are responsible for the basolateral endocytosis of IgA, and they also synthesize a secretory component that facilitates the apical release of IgA.

Salivary duct cells can also remove organic substances from the duct lumen. Endocytosis of acinar proteins and

other materials (e.g., ferritin) at the apical pole of the duct cell has been demonstrated immunocytochemically. In addition, salivary duct cells express the transferrin receptor (see p. 42) on the apical membrane, which indicates that some regulated endocytosis also occurs in these cells. The latter process may function to take up specific luminal substances or to traffic ion transporters to and from the apical plasma membrane.

## COMPOSITION, FUNCTION, AND CONTROL OF SALIVARY SECRETION

Depending on protein composition, salivary secretions can be serous, seromucous, or mucous

Most saliva ( $\sim 90 \%$ ) is produced by the major salivary glands: the parotid, the sublingual, and the submandibular glands (see Fig. 43-10A). The remaining $10 \%$ of saliva comes from numerous minor salivary glands that are scattered throughout the submucosa of the oral cavity. Each salivary gland produces either a serous, a seromucous, or a mucous secretion; the definition of these three types of saliva is based on the glycoprotein content of the gland's final secretory product. In humans and most other mammals, the parotids produce a serous secretion (i.e., low glycoprotein content), the sublingual and submandibular glands produce a seromucous secretion, and the minor salivary glands produce a mucous secretion.

Serous secretions are enriched in $\alpha$-amylase, and mucous secretions are enriched in mucin. However, the most abundant proteins in parotid and submandibular saliva are members of the group of proline-rich proteins, in which one third of all amino acids are proline. These proteins exist in acidic, basic, and glycosylated forms. They have antimicrobial properties and may play an important role in neutralizing dietary tannins, which can damage epithelial cells. In addition to serving these protective functions, proline-rich salivary proteins contribute to the lubrication of ingested foods and may enhance tooth integrity through their interactions with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and hydroxyapatite. Saliva also contains smaller amounts of lipase, nucleases, lysozyme, peroxidases, lactoferrin, secretory IgA, growth factors, regulatory peptides, and vasoactive proteases such as kallikrein and renin (Table 43-5).

Saliva functions primarily to prevent dehydration of the oral mucosa and to provide lubrication for the mastication and swallowing of ingested food. The senses of taste and, to a lesser extent, smell depend on an adequate supply of saliva. Saliva plays a very important role in maintaining proper oral hygiene. It accomplishes this task by washing away food particles, killing bacteria (lysozyme and IgA activity), and contributing to overall dental integrity. Although $\alpha$-amylase is a major constituent of saliva and digests a significant amount of the ingested starch, salivary amylase does not appear to be essential for effective carbohydrate digestion in the presence of a normally functioning pancreas. The same can be said for lingual lipase. However, in cases of pancreatic insufficiency, these salivary enzymes can partially compensate for the maldigestion that results from pancreatic dysfunction.

## At low flow rates, the saliva is hypotonic and rich in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, whereas at higher flow rates, its composition approaches that of plasma

The composition of saliva varies from gland to gland and from species to species. The primary secretion of the salivary acinar cell at rest is plasma-like in composition. Its osmolality, reflecting mainly $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, is $\sim 300 \mathrm{mOsm}$. The only significant difference from plasma is that the $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$of the salivary primary secretion is always slightly higher than that of plasma. In some species, acinar cells may help to generate a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-poor, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich primary secretion after salivary gland stimulation. In most species, however, salivary gland stimulation does not significantly alter acinar cell transport function or the composition of the primary secretion. The leakiness of the tight junctions (see p. 137) between acinar cells contributes to the formation of a plasma-like primary secretory product.

The composition of the primary salivary secretion is subsequently modified by the transport processes of the duct cell (see Fig. 43-11). At low (basal) flow rates, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$are absorbed from the lumen and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is secreted into the lumen by the duct cells of most salivary glands (Table 43-6). These transport processes generate a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-rich, hypotonic salivary secretion at rest. The tightness of the ductal epithelium inhibits paracellular water movement and therefore contributes to the formation of a hypotonic secretory product.

At higher flow rates, the composition of the final secretory product begins to approach that of the plasma-like primary secretion (see Table 43-6). This observation suggests that, as in the case of the renal tubules, the ductular transport processes have limited capacity to handle the increased load that is presented to them as the flow rate accelerates. However,

## BOX 43-3 Sjögren Syndrome

Sjögren syndrome is a chronic and progressive autoimmune disease that affects salivary secretion. Patients with Sjögren syndrome generate antibodies that react primarily with the salivary and lacrimal glands. Lymphocytes infiltrate the glands, and subsequent immunological injury to the acini leads to a decrease in net secretory function. Expression of the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is lost in the striated duct cells of the salivary gland. Sjögren syndrome can occur as a primary disease (salivary and lacrimal gland dysfunction only) or as a secondary manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. The disease primarily affects women; systemic disease usually does not develop.

Individuals with Sjögren syndrome have xerostomia (dry mouth) and keratoconjunctivitis sicca (dry eyes). Loss of salivary function causes these patients to have difficulty tasting, as well as chewing and swallowing dry food. They also have difficulty with continuous speech and complain of a chronic burning sensation in the mouth. On physical examination, patients with Sjögren syndrome have dry, erythematous oral mucosa with superficial ulceration and poor dentition (dental caries, dental fractures, and loss of dentition). Parotid gland enlargement is commonly present.

One of the proteins that is the target of the immunological attack in Sjögren syndrome is the water channel AQP5. No specific therapy for the disorder is available. Until the underlying cause of Sjögren syndrome is discovered, patients will have to rely on instillation of eyedrops and frequent ingestion of fluid to compensate for their deficiencies in lacrimal and salivary secretion. Various stimulants of salivary secretion (sialogogues), such as methylcellulose and sour candy, can also be helpful. Patients with severe involvement and functional disability are sometimes treated with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants.
the extent to which the transporters are flow dependent varies from gland to gland and from species to species. Human saliva is always hypotonic, and salivary $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is always greater than plasma $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$. In humans, increased salivary flow alkalinizes the saliva and increases its $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$. This salivary alkalinization and net $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion in humans neutralize the gastric acid that normally refluxes into the esophagus (Box 43-3).

## Parasympathetic stimulation increases salivary secretion

Humans produce $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~L}$ of saliva each day. Under basal conditions, the salivary glands produce saliva at a rate of $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, with a much slower flow rate during sleep. After stimulation, flow increases 10 -fold over the basal rate. Although the salivary glands respond to both cholinergic and adrenergic agonists in vitro, the parasympathetic nervous system is the most important physiological regulator of salivary secretion in vivo.

Parasympathetic Control Parasympathetic innervation to the salivary glands originates in the salivatory nuclei of the brainstem (see Fig. 14-5). Both local input and central input to the salivatory nuclei can regulate the parasympathetic signals transmitted to the glands. Taste and tactile stimuli from the tongue are transmitted to the brainstem, where their signals can excite the salivatory nuclei and stimulate salivary gland secretion. Central impulses triggered by the sight and smell of food also excite the salivatory nuclei and can induce salivation before food is ingested. These central effects were best illustrated by the classic experiments of Ivan Pavlov, who conditioned dogs to salivate at the sound of a bell. For his work on the physiology of digestion, Pavlov received the 1904 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (5) N43-8

Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers travel in cranial nerve (CN) VII to the submandibular ganglia, from which postganglionic fibers reach the sublingual and submandibular glands (see Fig. 14-4). Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers also travel in CN IX to the otic ganglia, from which postganglionic fibers reach the parotid glands. In addition, some parasympathetic fibers reach their final destination via the buccal branch of CN V to the parotid glands or via the lingual branches of CN V to the sublingual and submandibular glands. Postganglionic parasympathetic fibers from these ganglia directly stimulate the salivary glands through their release of ACh. The prominent role of the parasympathetic nervous system in salivary function can be readily appreciated by examining the consequences of cholinergic blockage. Disruption of the parasympathetic fibers to the salivary glands can lead to glandular atrophy. This observation suggests that parasympathetic innervation is necessary for maintaining the normal mass of salivary glands. Clinically, some medications (particularly psychiatric drugs) have "anticholinergic" properties that are most commonly manifested as "dry mouth." For some medications, this effect is so uncomfortable for the patient that use of the medication must be discontinued. Conversely, excessive salivation is induced by some anticholinesterase agents that can be found in certain insecticides and nerve gases.

Sympathetic Control The salivary glands are also innervated by postganglionic sympathetic fibers from the superior cervical ganglia that travel along blood vessels to the salivary glands (see Fig. 14-4). Although sympathetic (adrenergic) stimulation increases saliva flow, interruption of sympathetic nerves to the salivary glands has no major effect on salivary gland function in vivo. However, the sympathetic nervous

system is the primary stimulator of the myoepithelial cells that are closely associated with cells of the acini and proximal (intercalated) ducts. These stellate cells have structural features of both epithelial and smooth-muscle cells. They support the acinar structures and decrease the flow resistance of the intercalated ducts during stimulated secretion. Thus, the net effect of myoepithelial-cell activation is to facilitate secretory flow in the proximal regions of the gland, thus minimizing the extravasation of secretory proteins that could otherwise occur during an acute increase in secretory flow.

The sympathetic division can also indirectly affect salivary gland function by modulating blood flow to the gland. However, the relative contribution of this vascular effect to the overall secretory function of the salivary glands is difficult to determine.

Not only is salivary secretion subject to cholinergic and adrenergic regulation, but some autonomic fibers that
innervate the salivary glands contain VIP and substance $P$. Although acinar cells in vitro respond to stimulation by substance $P$, the physiological significance of these neurotransmitters in vivo has not been established. Salivary secretion is also regulated, in part, by mineralocorticoids. Stimulation by the adrenal hormone aldosterone produces saliva that contains relatively less $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The opposite effect on saliva is seen in patients with adrenal insufficiency caused by Addison disease (see p. 1019). The mineralocorticoid effect represents the only well-established example of regulation of salivary secretion by a hormone.

# INTESTINAL FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE MOVEMENT 

Henry J. Binder

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY

The small intestine and large intestine have many similarities in structure and function. In some cases, different regions of the intestinal tract carry out certain functions in much the same manner. In other cases, however, substantial heterogeneity exists between different intestinal segments (e.g., ileum versus jejunum) or between different mucosal areas (e.g., villus versus crypt) in one intestinal segment.

As discussed in Chapter 41, the basic structure of the intestine is a hollow cylinder with columnar epithelial cells lining the lumen, with circular and longitudinal layers of smooth muscle in the wall, and with endocrine and neural elements (see Fig. 41-2). Enteric neurons, as well as endocrine and paracrine agonists, regulate both epithelial transport and motor activity during both the interdigestive and the postprandial periods. As a result, the intestines propel their contents in a caudad direction while either removing fluid and electrolytes from the intestinal lumen (i.e., absorption) or adding these substances to the lumen (i.e., secretion).

## Both the small and large intestine absorb and secrete fluid and electrolytes, whereas only the small intestine absorbs nutrients

Among mammals, absorption of dietary nutrients is an exclusive function of the small intestine. Only during the neonatal period does significant nutrient absorption take place in the large intestine. The small intestine absorbs nonelectrolytes after extensive digestion of dietary nutrients by both luminal and brush-border enzymes, as discussed in Chapter 45. In contrast, both the small intestine and the large intestine absorb fluid and electrolytes by several different cellular transport processes, which may differ between the small intestine and large intestine and are the subject of this chapter.

Another vitally important function of the intestinal epithelium is the secretion of intestinal fluid and electrolytes. Teleologically, fluid secretion may be considered an adaptive mechanism of the intestinal tract that protects from noxious agents, such as bacteria and bacterial toxins. In general, the cellular mechanisms of intestinal electrolyte secretion in the small intestine and colon are similar, if not identical. Frequently, the adaptive signal that induces the secretory response also induces a motor response from the intestinal muscle, resulting in a propagated propulsive
response that promotes dilution and elimination of the offending toxin.

## The small intestine has a villus-crypt organization, whereas the colon has surface epithelial cells with interspersed crypts

Both the small intestine and the large intestine have a specialized epithelial structure that correlates well with epithelial transport function.

The small intestine (Fig. 44-1A) consists of finger-like projections-villi- surrounded by the openings of glandular structures called crypts of Lieberkühn, or simply crypts. Both villi and crypts are covered by columnar epithelial cells. The cells lining the villi are considered to be the primary cells responsible for both nutrient and electrolyte absorption, whereas the crypt cells primarily participate in secretion.

The colon (see Fig. 44-1B) does not have villi. Instead, the cells lining the large intestine are surface epithelial cells, and interspersed over the colonic surface are numerous apertures of colonic crypts (or glands) that are similar in function and structure to the small-intestinal crypts. Not surprisingly, the surface epithelial cells of the colon are the primary cells responsible for colonic electrolyte absorption, whereas colonic gland cells are generally believed to mediate ion secretion.

The intestinal mucosa is a dynamic organ with continuous cell proliferation and migration. The zone of cell proliferation is at the base of the crypt in both the small and large intestine, and the program of events is similar in both organs. The progenitor cell is a stem cell that differentiates into several specialized cells (e.g., vacuolated, goblet, and Paneth cells) that line the villi and crypts in the small intestine and the surface and glands in the colon. The vacuolated cell migrates along the crypt-villus axis and becomes a villous absorptive cell after undergoing substantial changes in its morphological and functional characteristics. In the small intestine, these villous cells migrate until they reach the tips of the villi, undergo apoptosis (see p. 1241), and then slough into the lumen of the intestine. The overall period from the initiation of cell proliferation to sloughing is $\sim 48$ to 96 hours. The overall rate of cell migration may increase or decrease: decreased cell turnover occurs during starvation, whereas increased cell turnover occurs during feeding and lactation, as well as after intestinal resection. The compensatory response that follows intestinal resection involves both luminal and hormonal factors.

Figure 44-1 Microscopic view of the anatomy of the small and large intestine. A, The surface area of the small intestine is amplified at three levels: (1) macroscopic folds of Kerckring, (2) microscopic villi and crypts of Lieberkühn, and (3) submicroscopic microvilli. B, The surface area of the colon is amplified at the same three levels as the small intestine: (1) macroscopic semilunar folds, (2) crypts (but not villi), and (3) microvilli.

## The surface area of the small intestine is amplified by folds, villi, and microvilli; amplification is less marked in the colon

An additional hallmark of both the small and large intestine is the presence of structures that amplify function by increasing the luminal surface area. These structures exist at three levels. In the small intestine, the first level consists of the macroscopic folds of Kerckring. The second level consists of the microscopic villi and crypts that we have already discussed. The third level is the submicroscopic microvilli on the apical surfaces of the epithelial cells. Thus, if the small intestine is thought of as a hollow cylinder, the net increase in total surface area of the small intestine (versus that of a smooth cylinder) is 600 -fold. The total surface area of the human small intestine is $\sim 200 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, or the surface area of a doubles tennis court (Table 44-1). The colonic surface area is also amplified, but to a more limited extent. Because the colon lacks villi, amplification is a result of only the presence of colonic folds, crypts, and microvilli. Amplification is an effective means of increasing the surface area that is available for intestinal absorption, the primary function of the small and large intestine.

## OVERVIEW OF FLUID AND ELECTROLYTE MOVEMENT IN THE INTESTINES

## The small intestine absorbs $\sim 6.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day of an $\sim 8.5-\mathrm{L}$ fluid load that is presented to it, and the colon absorbs $\sim 1.9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day

The fluid content of the average diet is typically 1.5 to $2.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. However, the fluid load to the small intestine is considerably greater- 8 to $9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. The difference between
these two sets of figures is accounted for by salivary, gastric, pancreatic, and biliary secretions, as well as the secretions of the small intestine itself (Fig. 44-2). Similarly, the total quantity of electrolytes $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right.$, and $\left.\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$that enters the lumen of the small intestine also comes from dietary sources in addition to endogenous secretions from the salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, liver, and small intestine.

We can calculate the absorption of water and electrolytes from the small intestine by comparing the total load that is presented to the lumen of the small intestine (i.e., $\sim 7.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day entering from other organs $+\sim 1.0 \mathrm{~L} /$ day secreted by the small intestine $=\sim 8.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) with that leaving the small intestine (i.e., ileocecal flow). The latter is $\sim 2.0 \mathrm{~L} /$ day in normal subjects. Thus, overall small-intestinal water absorption is about $8.5-2.0$, or $\sim 6.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is $\sim 600 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. Maximal small-intestinal fluid absorption has not been directly determined but has been estimated to be as great as 15 to $20 \mathrm{~L} /$ day.

Colonic fluid absorption is the difference between ileocecal flow ( $\sim 2.0 \mathrm{~L} /$ day) and stool water, which is usually $<0.2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day ( $\sim 0.1 \mathrm{~L} /$ day). Thus, colonic water absorption is about $2.0-0.1$, or $\sim 1.9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. In contrast, the maximal colonic water absorptive capacity is between 4 and $5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day. As a result, a significant increase in ileocecal flow (e.g., up to perhaps $5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, as occurs with a decrease in small-intestinal fluid absorption) will not exceed the absorptive capacity of the large intestine. Thus, a compensatory increase in colonic fluid absorption can prevent an increase in stool water (i.e., diarrhea) despite substantial decreases in fluid absorption by the small intestine.

The small intestine absorbs net amounts of water, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and secretes $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, whereas the colon absorbs net amounts of water, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ and secretes both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

Net ion movement represents the summation of several events. At the level of the entire small or large intestine, substantial movement of ions occurs from the intestinal lumen into the blood and from the blood into the lumen. The net ion movement across the entire epithelium is the difference between these two unidirectional fluxes.

Fluid and electrolyte transport in the intestine varies considerably in two different axes, both along the length of the intestines (segmental heterogeneity) and from the bottom of a crypt to the top of a villus or to the surface cells (cryptvillus/surface heterogeneity). A comparison of two different segments of intestine (e.g., duodenum versus ileum) shows that they differ substantially in function. These differences in function reflect segmental heterogeneity of ion transport processes along the longitudinal axis of the intestine in different macroscopic regions of both the small and the large intestine; these differences are both qualitative and

Figure 44-2 Fluid balance in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. For each segment of the GI tract, the figure shows substances flowing into the lumen on the left and substances flowing out of the lumen on the right. Of the $-8.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day that are presented to the small intestine, the small intestine removes $-6.5 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, delivering $-2 \mathrm{~L} /$ day to the colon. The large intestine removes $-1.9 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, leaving $-0.1 \mathrm{~L} /$ day in the feces. quantitative. For example, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stimulation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption occurs only in the proximal part of the small intestine. In contrast, the so-called electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (i.e., absorption associated with the development of a transepithelial potential difference) is restricted to the rectosigmoid segment of the colon.

Within an intestinal segment (e.g., a piece of ileum), crypt-villus/surface heterogeneity leads to differences in transport function along the radial axis of the intestine wall. For example, it is generally believed that absorptive function is located in villous cells in the small intestine (and surface epithelial cells in the large intestine), whereas secretory processes reside in the crypt cells. Finally, at a certain level within a single villus or crypt-or within a very small area of the colonic surface epithelium-individual cells may demonstrate further heterogeneity (cellular heterogeneity), with specific transport mechanisms restricted to different cells.

Overall ion movement in any segment of the intestine represents the summation of these various absorptive and secretory events. These events may be paracellular or transcellular, may occur in the villus or crypt, and may be mediated by a goblet cell or an absorptive cell.

Despite the segmental heterogeneity of small-intestinal electrolyte transport, overall water and ion movement in the proximal and distal portions of the small intestine is similar: in health, the small intestine is a net absorber of water, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, but is a net secretor of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 44-2). Fluid absorption is isosmotic in the small intestine, similar to that observed in the renal proximal tubule (see pp. 758759). In general, absorptive processes in the small intestine are enhanced in the postprandial state. The human colon carries out net absorption of water, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$with few exceptions, but it carries out net secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

## The intestines absorb and secrete solutes by both active and passive mechanisms

As discussed on pages 136-140, intestinal epithelial cells are polar; that is, they have two very different membranes-an apical membrane and a basolateral membrane-separated from one another by tight junctions. The transport processes present in the small and large intestine are quite similar to those present in other epithelia, such as the renal tubules, with only some organ-specific specialization to distinguish them. The transepithelial movement of a solute across the entire epithelium can be either absorptive or secretory. In each case, the movement can be either transcellular or paracellular. In transcellular movement, the solute must cross the two cell membranes in series. In general, movement of the solute across at least one of these membranes must be active (i.e., against an electrochemical gradient). In paracellular movement, the solute moves passively between adjacent epithelial cells through the tight junctions.

All transcellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is mediated by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (i.e., $\mathrm{Na}, \mathrm{K}$-ATPase) located at the basolateral membrane. This enzyme is responsible for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion across the basolateral membrane and results in a relatively low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right],(-15 \mathrm{mM})$ and an intracellular-negative membrane potential. This $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient serves as the driving force, in large part, for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry into the epithelial cell across the

luminal (apical) membrane, a process mediated either by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels or by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled transporters (e.g., $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransport, $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange). The epithelial cell may also use this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient to energize other transport processes at the apical or basolateral membrane.

## Intestinal fluid movement is always coupled to solute movement, and sometimes solute movement is coupled to fluid movement by solvent drag

Fluid movement is always coupled to active solute movement. (○) N44-1 The model of the osmotic coupling of fluid movement to solute movement in the intestine is similar to that in all or most epithelial cells (see p. 139). It is likely that the water movement occurs predominantly by a paracellular route (○) N44-2 rather than by a transcellular route. (○) N44-3

Solute movement is the driving force for fluid movement. However, the converse may also be true: solute movement may be coupled to fluid movement by solvent drag, a phenomenon in which the dissolved solute is swept along by bulk movement of the solvent (i.e., water). Solvent drag accounts for a significant fraction of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and urea absorbed in the human jejunum (but not in the more distal segments of the small intestine or the large intestine). For all intents and purposes, solvent drag occurs through the paracellular route, and it depends on the permeability properties of the tight junctions (reflection coefficient; see p. 468) and the magnitude of the convective water flow. Thus, solvent drag contributes primarily to the absorption of relatively small, water-soluble molecules, such as urea and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and it does so mainly in epithelia with relatively high permeability. The transepithelial permeability of the jejunum is considerably greater than that of the ileum or colon, as evidenced by its lower spontaneous transepithelial voltage difference $\left(V_{\mathrm{te}}\right)$, higher passive movement of NaCl , and larger apparent pore size.

## The resistance of the tight junctions primarily determines the transepithelial resistance of intestinal epithelia

Epithelial permeability is an inverse function of transepithelial resistance. In epithelial structures such as the small and large intestine, transepithelial resistance is determined by cellular resistance and paracellular resistance, which are arranged in parallel (see pp. 136-137). Paracellular resistance is considerably lower than transcellular resistance; therefore, overall mucosal resistance primarily reflects paracellular resistance, which in turn depends primarily on the properties of the tight junctions. Therefore, intestinal permeability is essentially a function of tight-junction structure. Just as transport function varies greatly throughout the intestine, major differences in transepithelial permeability and the properties of tight junctions are also present throughout the intestinal tract. In general, resistance increases in the aboral direction (i.e., moving away from the mouth). Thus, the resistance of the jejunum is considerably lower than that of the distal end of the colon. Evidence also indicates that the permeability of the tight junctions in the crypt is greater than that in the villus.

## CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ABSORPTION

Both the small intestine and the large intestine absorb large amounts of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$daily, but different mechanisms are responsible for this extremely important physiological process in different segments of the intestine. The villous epithelial cells in the small intestine and the surface epithelial cells in the colon are responsible for absorbing most of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. Absorption of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is the result of a complex interplay of both apical and basolateral membrane transport processes. Figure 44-3 summarizes the four fundamental mechanisms by which $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$may enter the cell across the apical membrane. In each case, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump is responsible, at least in part, for the movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from cell to blood. Also in each case, the driving force for apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry is provided by the large, inwardly directed electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, which in turn is provided by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump.

The following four sections describe these four apical membrane transport processes.

## Na/glucose and Na/amino-acid cotransport in the small intestine is a major mechanism for postprandial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption

"Nutrient-coupled" $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3A) occurs throughout the small intestine. Although glucose- and amino acid-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption also takes place in the colon of the newborn, it disappears during the neonatal period. Glucose- and amino acid-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption occurs only in villous epithelial cells and not in crypt epithelial cells (see Fig. 44-1A). This process is the primary mechanism for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption after a meal, but it makes little contribution during the interdigestive period, when only limited amounts of glucose and amino acids are present in the intestinal lumen.

Glucose- and amino acid-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is mediated by specific apical membrane transport proteins. The Na/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 (see pp. 121-122) is responsible for glucose uptake across the apical membrane, as discussed in Chapter 45. Several distinct $\mathrm{Na} /$ amino-acid cotransporters, each specific for a different class of amino acids (see Table 36-1), are responsible for the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled uptake of amino acids across the apical membrane. Because these transporters couple the energetically downhill movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to the uphill movement of glucose or an amino acid, the transporter processes are examples of secondary active transport (see p. 115). The glucose and amino acidcoupled uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry across the apical membrane increases $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$, which in turn increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$extrusion across the basolateral membrane through the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. Because the apical Na/glucose and $\mathrm{Na} /$ amino-acid cotransporters are electrogenic, as is the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, the overall transport of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$carries net charge and makes $V_{\mathrm{te}}$ more lumen negative. Thus, glucose- and amino acid-stimulated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is an electrogenic process. As discussed below, the increase in the lumen-negative $V_{\text {te }}$ provides the driving force for the parallel absorption of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$.

Nutrient-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$transporters, unlike other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ absorptive mechanisms in the small intestine, are not inhibited by either cAMP or $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Thus, agonists that increase

## N44-1 Nonosmotic Coupling of Water and Solute Movement in the Intestine

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The classical view, presented in the text, is that water transport always osmotically follows solute transport-that is, there is no such thing as a water pump (see pp. 127-136). However, Loo, Wright, and Zeuthen have suggested that the $\mathrm{Na} /$ glucose cotransporter SGLT1 can transport $>200$ water molecules for every two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions and one glucose molecule that it transports. (5) N44-5 In the specific case of the small intestine, these authors propose that SGLT1 can cotransport enough water to account for $\sim 50 \%$ of the total water absorption across the brush border of the human small intestine. On the other hand, Lapointe and colleagues have argued that the observed water movement is in fact secondary to local osmotic gradients that drive water movement via the classical pathway.

## N44-2 Pathways of Intestinal Water Movement

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Pappenheimer and Reiss have estimated that about 50\% of the fluid absorption in the small intestine occurs by a paracellular route. Moreover, they concluded that solvent drag-the entrainment of solutes by the paracellular flow of water-is a major pathway for the absorption of glucose and amino acids in the small intestine.

In his 1988 review, Pappenheimer proposed the following model: $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled glucose uptake into the intestinal cellfollowed by the deposition of solute in the lateral intercellular spaces between epithelial cells-provides the osmotic driving force for paracellular $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement, and hence solvent drag. Moreover, he speculated that $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled glucose transport somehow causes contraction of a ring of actomyosin just beneath the apical membrane, which pulls the tight junction apart slightly and increases the paracellular conductance to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

As far as the transcellular component of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement is concerned, the aquaporins AQP7 and AQP8 are present in the apical membranes of the small intestine and may play a role in transcellular $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ movement. Aquaporins are present in the colon, although their role there is not established.

# N44-5 The Water-Pump Controversy 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Loo and colleagues have proposed that the Na/glucose cotransporter SGLT1 in the human small intestine cotransports not only $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose, but water as well. In other words, with each cycle, SGLT1 would move $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, 1 glucose molecule, and $>200$ water molecules. The authors envisage that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions and glucose molecule-along with the water moleculeswould diffuse from the extracellular fluid into a pore within the cotransporter protein. The cotransporter would then undergo a conformational change that would close an outer gate and thereby occlude these ions and molecules from the extracellular fluid. By opening an inner gate, the cotransporter would deocclude these particles and allow the $2 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, the glucose molecule, and the 200+ water molecules to enter the cytoplasm of the intestinal cell (i.e., enterocyte). There is no controversy that this general model-minus the water-explains how SGLT1 works. The question is whether each cycle of the cotransporter also moves a fixed number of water molecules through the membrane protein along with the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose. Loo and colleagues suggest that the water pumped by SGLT1 would
account for about half of the water taken up by the small intestine.

On the other hand, Lapointe and colleagues have challenged the conclusion of Loo and colleagues, suggesting that the data of Loo and colleagues can more easily be explained by the classical model. That is, as SGLT1 cotransports $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and glucose from the extracellular to the intracellular fluid, water would follow osmotically.

[cAMP], (i.e., Escherichia coli or cholera enterotoxins) or $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, (i.e., serotonin) do not inhibit glucose- or amino acid-stimulated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption.

## Electroneutral Na-H exchange in the duodenum and jejunum is responsible for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption that is stimulated by luminal alkalinity

Luminal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-the result of pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal secretion-increases $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in the proximal
portion of the small intestine by stimulating apical membrane Na-H exchange (see Fig. 44-3B). The Na-H exchanger couples $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$uptake across the apical membrane to proton extrusion into the intestinal lumen, a process that is enhanced by both decreases in intracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ and increases in luminal pH . The energy for $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange comes from the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient, a consequence of the ability of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump to extrude $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, thereby lowering $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$. This process is characteristically inhibited by millimolar concentrations of the diuretic amiloride (Box 44-1).

## BOX 44-1 Oral Rehydration Solution

The therapeutic use of oral rehydration solution (ORS) provides an excellent demonstration of applied physiology. Many diarrheal illnesses (see Box 44-3) are caused by bacterial exotoxins that induce fluid and electrolyte secretion by the intestine. Hence such a toxin is referred to as an enterotoxin. Despite the massive toxin-induced fluid secretion, both intestinal morphology and nutrient-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption are normal. Because nutrient-coupled (e.g., glucose- or amino acid-coupled) fluid absorption is intact, therapeutically increasing the concentration of glucose or amino acids in the intestinal lumen can enhance absorption. ORS contains varying concentrations of glucose, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and is extremely effective in enhancing fluid and electrolyte absorption in secretory diarrhea when the intestine secretes massive amounts of fluid. Administration of ORS can reverse the dehydration and metabolic acidosis that may occur in severe diarrhea and that are often the primary cause of morbidity and mortality, especially in children younger than 5 years. ORS is the major advance of the past half century in the treatment of diarrheal disease, especially in developing countries. The development of ORS was a direct consequence of research on the physiology of glucose- and amino acidstimulated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption.

Several isoforms of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger exist (see p. 124), and different isoforms are present on the apical and basolateral membranes. Intestinal epithelial cells also have $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchangers on their basolateral membranes. However, this NHE1 isoform, like its counterpart in nonepithelial cells, regulates $\mathrm{pH}_{i}$ (a "housekeeping" function) and does not contribute to the transepithelial movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. In contrast, both the NHE2 and NHE3 exchanger isoforms present on the apical membrane are responsible for transepithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ movement and $\mathrm{pH}_{i}$ regulation. Although $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchangers are present on the apical membrane of villous epithelial cells throughout the entire intestine, only in the duodenum and jejunum (i.e., the proximal part of the small intestine) is $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange present without the parallel presence of $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers (see next section). Thus, in the proximal portion of the small intestine, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger solely mediates the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption that is stimulated by the alkalinity of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich intraluminal contents.

## Parallel Na-H and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange in the ileum and proximal part of the colon is the primary mechanism of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption during the interdigestive period

Electroneutral NaCl absorption occurs in portions of both the small and large intestine (see Fig. 44-3C). Electroneutral NaCl absorption is the result not of an $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter but rather of parallel apical membrane $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers that are closely linked by small changes in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. In the human colon, DRA (downregulated-inadenoma, SLC26A3; see Table 5-4) mediates this $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange. This mechanism of NaCl absorption is the primary method of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption between meals (i.e., the interdigestive period), but it does not contribute greatly to postprandial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption, which is mediated primarily by the nutrient-coupled transporters described previously. Electro-
neutral NaCl absorption occurs in the ileum and throughout the large intestine, with the exception of the most distal segment. It is not affected by either luminal glucose or luminal $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

The overall electroneutral NaCl absorptive process is under the control of both cAMP and cGMP, as well as intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Increases in each of these three intracellular messengers reduce NaCl absorption. Conversely, decreases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and increases in aldosterone both increase electroneutral NaCl absorption.

Decreased NaCl absorption is important in the pathogenesis of most diarrheal disorders. For example, one of the common causes of traveler's diarrhea (see Box 44-3) is the heat-labile enterotoxin produced by the bacterium E. coli. This toxin activates adenylyl cyclase and increases [cAMP]i, which in turn decreases NaCl absorption and stimulates active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion, as discussed below (see pp. 905-908). This toxin does not affect glucose-stimulated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see pp. 903-904).

## Epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are the primary mechanism of "electrogenic" $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in the distal part of the colon

In electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3D), $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry across the apical membrane occurs through epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels ( ENaCs ) that are highly specific for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$(see pp. 137-138). Like the Na-H exchanger, these ENaCs are blocked by the diuretic amiloride, but at micromolar rather than millimolar concentrations. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in the distal part of the colon is highly efficient. Because this segment of the colon is capable of absorbing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$against large concentration gradients, it plays an important role in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$conservation. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ movement via electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption is not affected by luminal glucose or by $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, nor is it regulated by cyclic nucleotides. However, it is markedly enhanced by mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone).

Mineralocorticoids increase $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in the colonas in other aldosterone-responsive epithelia, notably the renal collecting duct (see pp. 765-766)-via multiple mechanisms. Aldosterone increases electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption by increasing $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry through the apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel and by stimulating activity of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The increase in apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$uptake can occur (1) rapidly (i.e., within seconds) as a consequence of an increase in the opening of apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels, (2) more gradually (within minutes) because of the insertion of preformed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels from subapical epithelial vesicle pools into the apical membrane, or (3) very slowly (within hours) as a result of an increase in the synthesis of both new apical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps.

## CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF CI ${ }^{-}$ ABSORPTION AND SECRETION

$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption occurs throughout the small and large intestine and is often closely linked to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption may be coupled through either an electrical potential difference or by $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. However, sometimes no coupling takes place, and the route of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$movement may be either paracellular or transcellular.

Figure 44-4 Modes of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption by the intestine. A, In voltagedependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$may passively diffuse from lumen to blood across tight junctions, driven by a lumen-negative transepithelial voltage (paracellular route). Alternatively, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$may diffuse through apical and basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels.

## Voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption represents coupling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption to electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption in both the small intestine and the large intestine

$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption can be a purely passive process (Fig. 44-4A), driven by the electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$either across the tight junctions (paracellular route) or across the individual membranes of the epithelial cell (transcellular route). In either case, the driving force for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption derives from either of the two electrogenic mechanisms of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$

## BOX 44-2 Congenital Chloridorrhea

The congenital absence of an apical $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (which mediates the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange involved in electroneutral NaCl absorption) is an autosomal recessive disorder known as congenital chloridorrhea or congenital Cl^{-} diarrhea (CLD). Affected children have diarrhea with an extremely high stool $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]$, a direct consequence of the absence of the apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger. In addition, because $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ secretion is reduced, patients are alkalotic (i.e., have an increased plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$). The gene for congenital chloridorrhea is located on chromosome band 7q31. The gene product is the same as that of the DRA gene. DRA (SLC26A3; see Table 5-4) mediates electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange. In addition, DRA transports sulfate and other anions. However, DRA is distinct from other electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers in the duodenum and pancreatic ducts (SLC26A6) as well as the anion exchanger (AE) subfamily that encodes electroneutral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers in erythrocytes and several other tissues. Indeed, $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange in these other tissues is unaffected in individuals with CLD, as are other intestinal transport processes.
absorption: nutrient-coupled transport (see pp. 903-904) in the small intestine and ENaC channels in the distal end of the colon (see p. 905). This process is referred to as voltagedependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption; it is not an active transport process.

Within the small intestine, induction of a lumen-negative potential difference by glucose- and amino acid-induced $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3A) provides the driving force for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption that occurs following a meal. As noted above, nutrient-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption primarily represents a villous cell process that occurs in the postprandial period and is insensitive to cyclic nucleotides and changes in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. Voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption shares these properties. It is most likely that the route of voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption is paracellular.

In the large intestine, especially in the distal segment, electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption via ENaC channels (see Fig. 44-3D) also induces a lumen-negative potential difference that provides the driving force for colonic voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption. Factors that increase or decrease the voltage difference similarly affect $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption (Box 44-2).

## Electroneutral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange results in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion in the ileum and colon

Electroneutral $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange, in the absence of parallel $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange, occurs in villous cells in the ileum and in surface epithelial cells in the large intestine (see Fig. 44-4B). It is not known whether this process occurs in the cells lining the crypts. A $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger in the apical membrane is responsible for the $1: 1$ exchange of apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$for intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. In humans, this $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is DRA (see Table 5-4). The details of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$movement across the basolateral membrane are not well understood, but the process may involve a $\mathrm{ClC}-2 \mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (see Table 6-2, family No. 16).

![bo484869338f](bo484869338f.jpg)

Figure 44-5 Cellular mechanism of electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion by crypt cells. The basolateral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter brings $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$into the crypt cell; the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exits across the apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel. Secretagogues may open pre-existing $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels or cause subapical vesicles to fuse with the apical membrane, thus delivering new $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels. The paracellular pathway allows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$movement from blood to lumen, driven by the lumen-negative transepithelial voltage. The thickness of the arrows in the inset indicates the relative magnitudes of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretory fluxes in different segments.

## Parallel Na-H and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange in the ileum and the proximal part of the colon mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption during the interdigestive period

Electroneutral NaCl absorption, discussed in connection with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3C), also mediates $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ absorption in the ileum and proximal part of the colon (see Fig. 44-4C). The apical step of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption by this mechanism is mediated by parallel $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange (NHE3 or SLC9A3) and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange (DRA or SLC26A3), which are coupled through $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$.

## Electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion occurs in crypts of both the small and the large intestine

In the previous three sections, we saw that intestinal $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorption occurs via three mechanisms. The small intestine and the large intestine are also capable of active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion, although $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion is believed to occur mainly in the crypts rather than in either the villi or surface cells. 0 N44-4

A small amount of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion probably occurs in the "basal" state but is masked by the higher rate of the three $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$absorptive processes that are discussed above in this subchapter. However, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion is markedly stimulated by secretagogues such as acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters. Moreover, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion is the major component of the ion transport events that occur during many clinical and experimental diarrheal disorders.

The cellular model of active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion is outlined in Figure 44-5 and includes three transport pathways on the basolateral membrane: (1) an $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, (2) an $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NKCC1 or SLC12A2), and (3) two types of

$\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (IK1 and BK). In addition, a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR]) is present on the apical membrane. This complex $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretory system is energized by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, which generates a low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, and provides the driving force for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$entry across the basolateral membrane through $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport. As a result, $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$ is raised sufficiently that the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$electrochemical gradient favors the passive efflux of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the apical membrane. One consequence of these many transport processes is that the transepithelial voltage becomes more lumen negative, which promotes voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$secretion. This $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$secretion that accompanies active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion presumably occurs through the tight junctions (paracellular pathway). Thus, the net result is stimulation of NaCl and fluid secretion.

Normally (i.e., in the unstimulated state) the crypts secrete little $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$because the apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels are either closed or not present. $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion requires stimulation by any of several secretagogues, including (1) bacterial exotoxins (i.e., enterotoxins), (2) hormones and neurotransmitters, (3) products of cells of the immune system (e.g., histamine), and (4) laxatives (Table 44-2). These secretagogues act by increasing intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. For example, vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) acts through adenylyl cyclase; the heat-stable toxin of E. coli acts through guanylyl cyclase; and acetylcholine acts through phospholipase C.

The resulting activation of one or more protein kinasesby any of the aforementioned pathways-increases the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance of the apical membrane either by activating pre-existing $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels or by inserting into the apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels that-in the unstimulated state-are stored in subapical membrane vesicles. In either case, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ now exits the cell through apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels; the result is a decrease in $\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]_{\mathrm{i}}$, which leads to increased uptake of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$across the basolateral membrane via NKCC1. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$recycles out of the cell via the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycles through basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that open in

# N44-4 Spatial Distribution of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$Secretion 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

We have already introduced the concept of a spatial distribution of absorptive and secretory processes in which secretory processes are restricted to crypt epithelial cells and absorptive processes to villous/surface epithelial cells in both the small and large intestine (see pp. 901-902). However, this model is an oversimplification. For example, active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion occurs in villous/surface epithelial cells as well as in crypt epithelial cells.

## BOX 44-3 Secretory Diarrhea

Darrhea is a common medical problem and can be defined as a "symptom" (i.e., an increase in the number of bowel movements or a decrease in stool consistency) or as a sign (i.e., an increase in stool volume of $>0.2 \mathrm{~L} / 24 \mathrm{hr}$ ). Diarrhea has many causes and can be classified in various ways. One classification divides diarrheas by the causative factor. The causative factor can be failure to absorb a dietary nutrient, in which case the result is an osmotic diarrhea. An example of osmotic diarrhea is that caused by primary lactase deficiency. Alternatively, the causative factor may not be lack of absorption of a dietary nutrient, but rather endogenous secretion of fluid and electrolytes from the intestine, in which case the result is secretory diarrhea.

The leading causes of secretory diarrhea include infections with E. coli (the major cause of traveler's diarrhea) and cholera (a cause of substantial morbidity and mortality in developing countries). In these and other infectious diarrheas, an enterotoxin produced by one of many bacterial organisms raises intracellular concentrations of cAMP, cGMP, or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see Table 44-2).

A second group of secretory diarrheas includes those produced by different, relatively uncommon hormone-producing tumors. Examples of such tumors include those that produce VIP (Verner-Morrison syndrome), glucagon (glucagonomas), and serotonin (carcinoid syndrome). These secretagogues act by raising either [cAMP], or $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$, (see Table 44-2). When tumors produce these secretagogues in abundance, the resulting diarrhea can be copious and explosive.

As we have seen, the secretory diarrheas have in common their ability to increase [cAMP], [cGMP], or $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$. Table 44-4 summarizes the mechanisms by which these second messengers produce the secretory diarrhea. Because the second messengers do not alter the function of nutrient-coupled $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption, administration of an oral rehydration solution containing glucose and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is effective in the treatment of enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea (see Box 44-1).
response to the same protein kinases that increase $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance. The net result of all these changes is the initiation of active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion across the epithelial cell.

The induction of apical membrane $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels is extremely important in the pathophysiology of many diarrheal disorders. Box 44-3 discusses the changes in ion transport that occur in secretory diarrheas such as that associated with cholera. A central role in cystic fibrosis has been posited for the CFTR $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel in the apical membrane (see p. 122). However, other $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, including the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated CaCC (see Table 6-2, family No. 17) are likely present in the intestine and may contribute to active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion.

## CELLULAR MECHANISMS OF K ${ }^{+}$ ABSORPTION AND SECRETION

Overall net transepithelial $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement is absorptive in the small intestine and secretory in the colon

The gastrointestinal tract participates in overall $\mathrm{K}^{+}$balance, although compared with the kidneys, the small intestine and
large intestine play relatively modest roles, especially in healthy individuals.

The pattern of intestinal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement parallels that of the kidney: (1) the intestines have the capacity for both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption and secretion, and (2) the intestines absorb $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the proximal segments but secrete it in the distal segments.

Dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$furnishes 80 to $120 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day, whereas stool $\mathrm{K}^{+}$output is only $\sim 10 \mathrm{mmol} /$ day. The kidney is responsible for disposal of the remainder of the daily $\mathrm{K}^{+}$intake (see p. 795). Substantial quantities of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$are secreted in gastric, pancreatic, and biliary fluid. Therefore, the total $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ load presented to the small intestine is considerably greater than that represented by the diet. The concentration of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ in stool is frequently $>100 \mathrm{mM}$. This high stool $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$is the result of several factors, including both colonic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion and water absorption, especially in the distal part of the colon.

## $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption in the small intestine probably occurs via solvent drag

Experiments in which a plasma-like solution perfused segments of the intestine have established that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum of the small intestine and is secreted in the large intestine. Although the small intestine absorbs substantial amounts of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, no evidence has been presented to suggest that $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption in the jejunum and ileum is an active transport process or even carrier mediated. Thus, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ absorption in the small intestine is probably passive, most likely a result of solvent drag (i.e., pulled along by bulk water movement; see p. 908), as illustrated in Figure 44-6A. Although changes in dietary $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and alterations in hydration influence $\mathrm{K}^{+}$movement in the colon, similar physiological events do not appear to affect $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption in the small intestine.

## Passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is the primary mechanism for net colonic secretion

In contrast to the small intestine, the human colon is a net secretor of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. This secretion occurs by two mechanisms: a passive transport process that is discussed in this section and an active process that is discussed in the next. Together, these two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretory pathways are greater than the modest component of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption in the distal part of the colon and thus account for the overall secretion of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$by the colon.

Passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, which is the pathway that is primarily responsible for overall net colonic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, is driven by the lumen-negative $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ of 15 to 25 mV . The route of passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is predominantly paracellular, not transcellular (see Fig. 44-6B). Because $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ is the primary determinant of passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, it is not surprising that passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion is greatest in the distal end of the colon, where $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ difference is most negative. Similarly, increases in the lumen-negative $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ that occur as an adaptive response to dehydration-secondary to an elevation in aldosterone secretion (see the next section)-result in an enhanced rate of passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Information is not available regarding the distribution of passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion between surface epithelial and crypt cells.

Figure 44-6 Cellular mechanisms of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion and absorption. A, In the small intestine, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption occurs via solvent drag. B, Throughout the colon, passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion occurs via tight junctions, driven by a lumen-negative transepithelial voltage. C, Throughout the colon, active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is transcellular. D, In the distal colon, active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption is transcellular. The thickness of the arrows in the insets indicates the relative magnitude of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$flux in different segments.

## Active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is also present throughout the large intestine and is induced both by aldosterone and by cAMP

In addition to passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion, active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport processes-both secretory and absorptive-are also present in the colon. However, active transport of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$is subject to considerable segmental variation in the colon. Whereas active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion occurs throughout the colon, active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ absorption is present only in the distal segments of the large intestine. Thus, in the rectosigmoid colon, active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption and active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion are both operative and appear to contribute to total-body homeostasis.

The model of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the colon is quite similar to that of active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see Fig. 44-5) and is also parallel to that of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in the renal distal nephron (see p. 799). The general paradigm of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$transport in the colon is a "pump-leak" model (see Fig. 44-6C). Uptake of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$across the basolateral membrane is a result of both the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump and the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (NKCC1), which is energized by the low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, that is created by the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. Once $\mathrm{K}^{+}$enters the cell across the basolateral membrane, it may exit either across the apical membrane ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion) or across the basolateral membrane ( $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ recycling). The cell controls the extent to which secretion occurs, in part by $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels present in both the apical and the basolateral membranes. When apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel activity is less than basolateral channel activity, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$recycling dominates. Indeed, in the basal state, the rate of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion is low because the apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel activity is minimal in comparison with the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel activity in the basolateral membrane.

It is likely that aldosterone stimulates active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in surface epithelial cells of the large intestine, whereas cAMP enhances active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion in crypt cells. In both cases, the rate-limiting step is the apical $\mathrm{BK} \mathrm{K}^{+}$ channel, and both secretagogues act by increasing $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel activity.

Aldosterone The mineralocorticoid aldosterone enhances overall net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by two mechanisms. First, it increases passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by increasing $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump activity and thus increasing electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3D). The net effects are to increase the lumen-negative $V_{\mathrm{tr}}$ and to enhance passive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (see Fig. 44-6B). Second, aldosterone stimulates active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion by increasing the activity of both apical $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pumps (see Fig. 44-6C).
cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ VIP and cholera enterotoxin both increase [cAMP], and thus stimulate $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. Increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$-induced, for example, by serotonin (or 5 hydroxytryptamine [5-HT])—also stimulate active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion. In contrast to aldosterone, neither of these second messengers has an effect on the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump; rather, they increase the activity of both the apical and the basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Because the stimulation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is greater at the apical than at the basolateral membrane, the result is an increase in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit from the epithelial cell across the apical membrane (i.e., secretion). Stimulation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion by cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, both of which also induce

active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see Fig. 44-5), contributes to the significant fecal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$losses that occur in many diarrheal diseases.

## Active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption takes place only in the distal portion of the colon and is energized by an apical H-K pump

As noted above, not only does the distal end of the colon actively secrete $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, it also actively absorbs $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. The balance between the two processes plays a role in overall $\mathrm{K}^{+}$homeostasis. Increases in dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$enhance both passive and active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (see Fig. 44-6B, C). However, dietary $\mathrm{K}^{+}$depletion enhances active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-6D). The mechanism of active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption appears to be an exchange of luminal $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$across the apical membrane, mediated by an H-K pump (see pp. 117-118). The colonic H-K pump is $\sim 60 \%$ identical at the amino-acid level to both the Na-K pump and the gastric parietal-cell H-K pump. Thus, active colonic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption occurs via a transcellular route, in contrast to the paracellular route that characterizes $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption in the small intestine (see Fig. 44-6A). The mechanism of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit across the basolateral membrane may involve $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransport. Not known is whether active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion (see Fig. 44-6C) and active $\mathrm{K}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-6D) occur in the same cell or in different cells.

## REGULATION OF INTESTINAL ION TRANSPORT

## Chemical mediators from the enteric nervous system, endocrine cells, and immune cells in the lamina propria may be either secretagogues or absorptagogues

Numerous chemical mediators from several different sources regulate intestinal electrolyte transport. Some of these agonists are important both in health and in diarrheal disorders, and at times only quantitative differences separate normal regulatory control from the pathophysiology of diarrhea. These mediators may function in one or more modes: neural, endocrine, paracrine, and perhaps autocrine (see p. 47). Most of these agonists (i.e., secretagogues) promote secretion, whereas some others (i.e., absorptagogues) enhance absorption.

The enteric nervous system (ENS), discussed on pages $339-340$ and $855-856$, is important in the normal regulation of intestinal epithelial electrolyte transport. Activation of enteric secretomotor neurons results in the release of acetylcholine from mucosal neurons and in the induction of active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see Fig. 44-5). Additional neurotransmitters, including VIP, 5-HT, and histamine, mediate ENS regulation of epithelial ion transport.

An example of regulation mediated by the endocrine system is the release of aldosterone from the adrenal cortex and the subsequent formation of angiotensin II; both dehydration and volume contraction stimulate this renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis (see pp. 841-842). Both angiotensin and aldosterone regulate total-body $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$homeostasis by stimulating $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption, angiotensin in the small intestine, and aldosterone in the colon. Their effects on cellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption differ. In the small intestine, angiotensin

| CELL | PRODUCT |
| :-- | :-- |
| Macrophages | Prostaglandins <br> $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ radicals |

enhances electroneutral NaCl absorption (see Fig. 44-3C), probably by upregulating apical membrane $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange. In the colon, aldosterone stimulates electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption (see Fig. 44-3D).

The response of the intestine to angiotensin and aldosterone represents a classic endocrine feedback loop: dehydration results in increased levels of angiotensin and aldosterone, the primary effects of which are to stimulate fluid and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption by both the renal tubules (see pp. 765-766) and the intestines. The result is restoration of total-body fluid and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$content.

Regulation of intestinal transport also occurs by paracrine effects. Endocrine cells constitute a small fraction of the total population of mucosal cells in the intestines. These endocrine cells contain several peptides and bioactive amines that are released in response to various stimuli. Relatively little is known about the biology of these cells, but gut distention can induce the release of one or more of these agonists (e.g., 5-HT). The effect of these agonists on adjacent surface epithelial cells represents a paracrine action.

Another example of paracrine regulation of intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport is the influence of immune cells in the lamina propria (see Fig. 44-1). Table 44-3 lists these immune cells and some of the agonists that they release. The same agonist may be released from more than one cell, and individual cells produce multiple agonists. These agonists may activate epithelial cells directly or may activate other immune cells or enteric neurons. For example, reactive oxygen radicals released by mast cells affect epithelial-cell function by acting on enteric neurons and fibroblasts, and they also have direct action on surface and crypt epithelial cells.

A single agonist usually has multiple sites of action. For example, the histamine released from mast cells can induce fluid secretion as a result of its interaction with receptors on surface epithelial cells (Fig. 44-7). However, histamine can also activate ENS motor neurons, which can in turn alter epithelial-cell ion transport as well as intestinal smoothmuscle tone and blood flow. As a consequence, the effects of histamine on intestinal ion transport are multiple and amplified.

## Secretagogues can be classified by their type and by the intracellular second-messenger system that they stimulate

Several agonists induce the accumulation of fluid and electrolytes in the intestinal lumen (i.e., net secretion).

![bo504869338f](bo504869338f.jpg)

Figure 44-7 Mast cell activation. Activation of mast cells in the lamina propria triggers the release of histamine, which either directly affects epithelial cells or stimulates an enteric neuron and thus has an indirect effect. The neuron modulates the epithelium (secretion), intestinal smooth muscle (motility), or vascular smooth muscle (blood flow). ACh, acetylcholine; $\mathrm{EP}_{2}$ receptor, prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$ receptor; IL-1, interleukin-1; $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, prostaglandin $\mathrm{E}_{2}$.

These secretagogues are a diverse, heterogeneous group of compounds, but they can be effectively classified in two different ways: by the type of secretagogue and by the intracellular second messenger that these agonists activate.

Grouped according to type, the secretagogues fall into four categories: (1) bacterial exotoxins (i.e., enterotoxins), (2) hormones and neurotransmitters, (3) products of cells of the immune system, and (4) laxatives. Table 44-2 provides a partial list of these secretagogues. A bacterial exotoxin is a peptide that is produced and excreted by bacteria that can produce effects independently of the bacteria. An enterotoxin is an exotoxin that induces changes in intestinal fluid and electrolyte movement. For example, E. coli produces two distinct enterotoxins (the so-called heat-labile and heatstable toxins) that induce fluid and electrolyte secretion via two distinct receptors and second-messenger systems.

We can also classify secretagogues according to the signaltransduction system that they activate after binding to a specific membrane receptor. As summarized in Table 44-2, the second messengers of these signal-transduction systems include cAMP, cGMP, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. For example, the heat-labile toxin of E. coli binds to apical membrane receptors, becomes internalized, and then activates basolateral adenylyl cyclase. The resulting increase in [cAMP]_{i} activates protein kinase A. VIP also acts by this route (Fig. 44-8). The heat-stable toxin of E. coli binds to and activates an apical receptor guanylyl cyclase, similar to the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) receptor (see p. 66). The newly produced cGMP activates protein kinase G and may also activate protein kinase A. The natural agonist for this pathway is guanylin, a 15 -amino-acid peptide secreted by mucosal cells of the small and large intestine. Still other secretory agonists (e.g., 5-HT) produce their effects by increasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and thus activating protein kinase C or $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-calmodulin-dependent protein kinases. One way that secretagogues can increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is by stimulating phospholipase C, which leads to the production of inositol

## TABLE 44-4 End Effects of Second Messengers on Intestinal Transport

1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from intracellular stores (see p. 60). Secretagogues can also increase $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ by activating protein kinases, which may stimulate basolateral $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

Although the secretagogues listed in Table 44-2 stimulate fluid and electrolyte secretion via one of three distinct second messengers (i.e., cAMP, cGMP, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ), the end effects are quite similar. As summarized in Table 44-4, all three second-messenger systems stimulate active $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see Fig. 44-5) and inhibit electroneutral NaCl absorption (see Fig. 44-3C). The abilities of cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to stimulate $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion and inhibit electroneutral NaCl absorption are almost identical. In contrast, cGMP's ability to stimulate $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion is somewhat less, although its effects on electroneutral NaCl absorption are quantitatively similar to those of cAMP and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Both stimulation of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ secretion and inhibition of electroneutral NaCl absorption have the same overall effect: net secretion of fluid and electrolytes. It is uncertain whether the observed decrease in electroneutral NaCl absorption is the result of inhibiting $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange, $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange, or both inasmuch as electroneutral NaCl absorption represents the coupling of separate $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange processes via $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (see Fig. 44-3C).

## Mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and somatostatin are absorptagogues

Although multiple secretagogues exist, relatively few agonists can be found that enhance fluid and electrolyte absorption. The cellular effects of these absorptagogues are less well understood than those of the secretagogues. Those few absorptagogues that have been identified increase intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption by either a paracrine or an endocrine mechanism.

Corticosteroids are the primary hormones that enhance intestinal fluid and electrolyte absorption. Mineralocorticoids (e.g., aldosterone) stimulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ secretion in the distal end of the colon; they do not affect ion transport in the small intestine. Their cellular actions are outlined on page 1027. Aldosterone induces both apical membrane $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (a process that is inhibited by the diuretic amiloride) and basolateral Na-K pumps; this
action results in substantial enhancement of colonic "electrogenic" $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption. Although the effects of glucocorticoids on ion transport have most often been considered a result of crossover binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor (see p. 766), it is now evident that glucocorticoids also have potent actions on ion transport via their own receptor and that these changes in ion transport are distinct from those of the mineralocorticoids. Glucocorticoids stimulate electroneutral NaCl absorption (see Fig. 44-5C) throughout the large and small intestine without any effect on either $\mathrm{K}^{+}$secretion or electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$absorption. Both corticosteroids act, at least in part, by genomic mechanisms (see pp. 71-72).

Other agonists appear to stimulate fluid and electrolyte absorption by stimulating electroneutral NaCl absorption and inhibiting electrogenic $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion; both these changes enhance fluid absorption. Among these absorptagogues are somatostatin, which is released from endocrine

cells in the intestinal mucosa (see pp. 993-994), and the enkephalins and norepinephrine, which are neurotransmitters of enteric neurons. The limited information available suggests that these agonists affect ion transport by decreasing $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, probably by blocking $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Thus, it appears that fluctuations in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ regulate $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$transport in both the absorptive (low $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ ) and secretory (high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ )
directions. Therefore, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is clearly a critical modulator of intestinal ion transport.

# NUTRIENT DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION 

Henry J. Binder and Charles M. Mansbach II

In general, the digestive-absorptive processes for most of the constituents of our diet are highly efficient. For example, normal adult intestine absorbs $\sim 95 \%$ of dietary lipid. However, we ingest most of the constituents of dietary food in a form that the intestine cannot readily absorb. Multiple digestive processes convert dietary food to a form that can be absorbed-primarily in the small intestine, but also, to a much smaller extent, in the colon.

The digestive process-the enzymatic conversion of complex dietary substances to a form that can be absorbedis initiated by the sight, smell, and taste of food. Although some digestion (that of carbohydrates) begins in the mouth and additional digestion may occur within the lumen of the stomach, most digestive processes occur in the small intestine. Digestion within the small intestine occurs either in the lumen, mediated by pancreatic enzymes, or at the smallintestinal brush-border membrane (membrane digestion), mediated by brush-border enzymes. Several different patterns of luminal, brush-border, and cytosolic digestion exist (Fig. 45-1). Some of the dietary carbohydrate and protein that escape digestion and absorption in the small intestine are altered in the large intestine by bacterial enzymes to short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) ( $\mathbf{N 4 5 - 1}$ that are absorbed by the colon.

The digestive processes for carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids result in the conversion of dietary nutrients to chemical forms for which intestinal absorptive processes exist. As a consequence, the digestive-absorptive processes for the several dietary constituents are closely integrated and regulated biological events that ensure survival. Multiple diseases can alter these digestive-absorptive processes and can thereby impair nutrient assimilation (i.e., the overall process of digestion and absorption). Because of the substantial segmental distribution of nutrient absorption along the gastrointestinal tract (Fig. 45-2), the clinical manifestations of disease (Table 45-1) often reflect these segmental differences.

## CARBOHYDRATE DIGESTION

Carbohydrates, providing $\mathbf{- 4 5 \%}$ of total energy needs of Western diets, require hydrolysis to monosaccharides before absorption

We can classify dietary carbohydrates into two major groups: (1) the monosaccharides (monomers), and (2) the oligosaccharides (short polymers) and polysaccharides (long
polymers). The small intestine can directly absorb the monomers but not the polymers. Some polymers are digestible, that is, the body can digest them to form the monomers that the small intestine can absorb. Other polymers are nondigestible, or "fiber." The composition of dietary carbohydrate is quite varied and is a function of culture. The diet of individuals in so-called developed countries contains considerable amounts of "refined" sugar and, compared with individuals in most developing countries, less fiber. Such differences in the fiber content of the Western diet may account for several diseases that are more prevalent in these societies (e.g., colon carcinoma and atherosclerosis). As a consequence, the consumption of fiber by the health-conscious public in the United States has increased during the past 3 decades. In general, increased amounts of fiber in the diet are associated with increased stool weight and frequency.

Approximately $45 \%$ to $60 \%$ of dietary carbohydrate is in the form of starch, which is a polysaccharide. Starch is a storage form for carbohydrates that is primarily found in plants, and it consists of both amylose and amylopectin. In contrast, the storage form of carbohydrates in animal tissues is glycogen, which is consumed in much smaller amounts. Amylose is a straight-chain glucose polymer that typically contains multiple glucose residues, connected by $\alpha-1,4$ linkages. In contrast, amylopectin is a massive branched glucose polymer that may contain 1 million glucose residues. In addition to the $\alpha-1,4$ linkages, amylopectin has frequent $\alpha-1,6$ linkages at the branch points. Amylopectins are usually present in much greater quantities (perhaps 4 -fold higher) than amylose. Glycogen-the "animal starch"-has $\alpha-1,4$ and $\alpha-1,6$ linkages like amylopectin. However, glycogen is more highly branched (i.e., more $\alpha-1,6$ linkages).

Most dietary oligosaccharides are the disaccharides sucrose and lactose, which represent $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of dietary carbohydrates. Sucrose is table sugar, derived from sugar cane and sugar beets, whereas lactose is the sugar found in milk. The remaining carbohydrates are the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, which make up $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of total carbohydrate intake. There is no evidence of any intestinal absorption of either starches or disaccharides. Because the small intestine can absorb only monosaccharides, all dietary carbohydrate must be digested to monosaccharides before absorption. The colon cannot absorb monosaccharides.

Dietary fiber consists of both soluble and insoluble forms and includes lignins, pectins, and cellulose. These fibers are primarily present in fruits, vegetables, and cereals. Cellulose

Figure 45-1 General mechanisms of digestion and absorption. Digestion-absorption can follow any of five patterns. First, the substance (e.g., glucose) may not require digestion; the intestinal cells may absorb the nutrient as ingested. Second, a polymer (e.g., protein) may be digested in the lumen to its constituent monomers (e.g., amino acids) by pancreatic enzymes prior to absorption. Third, an oligomer (e.g., sucrose) is digested into its constituent monomers (e.g., monosaccharides) by brush-border enzymes prior to absorption. When in free solution, fructose is present primarily as the pyranose (6-membered ring) form and less so as the furanose (5-membered ring) form. Fourth, an oligomer (e.g., oligopeptide) may be directly absorbed by the cell and then broken down into monomers (e.g., amino acids) inside the cell. Finally, a substance (e.g., TAG) may be broken down into its constituent components prior to absorption; the cell may then resynthesize the original molecule.

is a glucose polymer connected by $\beta-1,4$ linkages, which cannot be digested by mammalian enzymes. However, enzymes from colonic bacteria may degrade fiber. This process is carried out with varying efficiency; pectins, gum, and mucilages are metabolized to a much greater degree than either cellulose or hemicellulose. In contrast, lignins, which are aromatic polymers and not carbohydrates, are not altered by microbial enzymes in the colonic lumen and are excreted unaltered in stool.

As we discuss below, the digestive process for dietary carbohydrates has two steps: (1) intraluminal hydrolysis of starch to oligosaccharides by salivary and pancreatic amylases (Fig. 45-3), and (2) so-called membrane digestion of oligosaccharides to monosaccharides by brush-border disaccharidases. The resulting carbohydrates are absorbed by transport processes that are specific for certain monosaccharides. These transport pathways are located in the apical membrane of the small-intestinal villous epithelial cells.

![bo534869338f](bo534869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-2 Sites of nutrient absorption. A, The entire small intestine absorbs carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. However, the absorption is greatest in the duodenum, somewhat less in the jejunum, and much less in the ileum. The thickness of the arrows indicates the relative magnitude of total absorption at the indicated site in vivo (see inset). The maximal absorptive capacity of a specific segment under optimized experimental conditions (e.g., substrate concentrations) may be greater. B, Some substances are actively absorbed only in the duodenum. C, Bile acids are absorbed along the entire small intestine, but active absorption occurs only in the ileum. D, The vitamin cobalamin is absorbed only in the ileum.

## Luminal digestion begins with the action of salivary amylase and finishes with pancreatic amylase

Acinar cells from both the salivary glands (see pp. 893-894) and pancreas (see p. 882) synthesize and secrete $\alpha$-amylases. Salivary and pancreatic amylases, unlike most of the pancreatic proteases that we discuss below, are secreted not in an inactive proenzyme form, but rather in an active form. Salivary and pancreatic $\alpha$-amylases have similar enzymatic function, and their amino-acid sequences are $94 \%$ identical.

Salivary $\alpha$-amylase in the mouth initiates starch digestion; in healthy adults, this step is of relatively limited importance. Salivary amylase is inactivated by gastric acid but can be partially protected by complexing with oligosaccharides.

Pancreatic $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-amylase completes starch digestion in the lumen of the small intestine. Although amylase binds to the apical membrane of enterocytes, this localization does not provide any kinetic advantage for starch hydrolysis. Cholecystokinin (CCK; see pp. 882-883) stimulates the secretion of pancreatic $\alpha$-amylase by pancreatic acinar cells.
$\alpha$-amylase is an endoenzyme that hydrolyzes internal $\alpha-1,4$ linkages (see Fig. 45-3A). $\alpha$-amylase does not cleave terminal $\alpha-1,4$ linkages, $\alpha-1,6$ linkages (i.e., branch points), or $\alpha-1,4$ linkages that are immediately adjacent to $\alpha-1,6$ linkages. As a result, starch hydrolysis products are maltose,
maltotriose, and $\alpha$-limit dextrins. Because $\alpha$-amylase has no activity against terminal $\alpha-1,4$ linkages, glucose is not a product of starch digestion. The intestine cannot absorb these products of amylase digestion of starch, and thus further digestion is required to produce substrates (i.e., monosaccharides) that the small intestine can absorb by specific transport mechanisms.

## "Membrane digestion" involves hydrolysis of oligosaccharides to monosaccharides by brush-border disaccharidases

The human small intestine has three brush-border proteins with oligosaccharidase activity: lactase, glucoamylase (most often called maltase), and sucrase-isomaltase. These are all integral membrane proteins whose catalytic domains face the intestinal lumen (see Fig. 45-3B). Sucrase-isomaltase is actually two enzymes-sucrase and isomaltase (also known as $\alpha$-dextrinase or debranching enzyme)-bound together. Thus, four oligosaccharidase entities are present at the brush border. Lactase has only one substrate; it breaks lactose into glucose and galactose. The other three enzymes have more complicated substrate spectra. All will cleave the terminal $\alpha-1,4$ linkages of maltose, maltotriose, and $\alpha$-limit dextrins. In addition, each of these three enzymes has at least one

They can digest the linear "internal" $\alpha-1,4$ linkages between glucose residues but cannot break "terminal" $\alpha-1,4$ linkages between the last two sugars in the chain. They also cannot split the $\alpha-1,6$ linkages at the branch points of amylopectin or the adjacent $\alpha-1,4$ linkages. As a result, the products of $\alpha$-amylase action are linear glucose oligomers, maltotriose (a linear glucose trimer), maltose (a linear glucose dimer), and $\alpha$-limit dextrins (which contain an $\alpha-1,6$ branching linkage). B, The brush-border oligosaccharidases are intrinsic membrane proteins with their catalytic domains facing the lumen. Sucrase-isomaltase is actually two enzymes, and therefore, there are a total of four oligosaccharidases that split the oligosaccharides produced by $\alpha$-amylase into monosaccharides. C, SGLT1 is the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled transporter that mediates the uptake of glucose or galactose from the lumen of the small intestine into the enterocyte. GLUT5 mediates the facilitated diffusion of fructose into the enterocyte. Once the monosaccharides are inside the enterocyte, GLUT2 mediates their efflux across the basolateral membrane into the interstitial space.

Figure 45-4 Effects of lactase deficiency on levels of glucose in the plasma and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in the breath. A, In an individual with normal lactase activity, blood glucose levels rise after the ingestion of either glucose or lactose. Thus, the small intestine can split the lactose into glucose and galactose, and absorb the two monosaccharides. At the same time, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ in the breath is low. B, In an adult with low lactase activity, the rise in blood levels is less pronounced after ingesting lactose. Because the rise is normal after ingesting glucose, we can conclude that the difference is due to lactase activity. Conversely, the individual with lactase deficiency excretes large amounts of $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ into the breath. This $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is the product of lactose catabolism by colonic bacteria.
other activity. Maltase can also degrade the $\alpha-1,4$ linkages in straight-chain oligosaccharides up to nine monomers in length. However, maltase cannot split either sucrose or lactose. The sucrase moiety of sucrase-isomaltase is required to split sucrose into glucose and fructose. The isomaltase moiety of sucrase-isomaltase is critical; it is the only enzyme that can split the branching $\alpha-1,6$ linkages of $\alpha$-limit dextrins. (5) N45-2

The action of the four oligosaccharidases generates several monosaccharides. Whereas the hydrolysis products of maltose are two glucose residues, those of sucrose are glucose and fructose. The hydrolysis of lactose by lactase yields glucose and galactose. The activities of the hydrolysis reactions of sucrase-isomaltase and maltase are considerably greater than the rates at which the various transporters can absorb the resulting monosaccharides. Thus, uptake, not hydrolysis, is the rate-limiting step. In contrast, lactase activity is considerably less than that of the other oligosaccharidases and is rate limiting for overall lactose digestion-absorption.

The oligosaccharidases have a varying spatial distribution throughout the small intestine. In general, the abundance
and activity of oligosaccharidases peak in the proximal jejunum (i.e., at the ligament of Treitz) and are considerably less in the duodenum and distal ileum. Oligosaccharidases are absent in the large intestine. The distribution of oligosaccharidase activity parallels that of active glucose transport.

These oligosaccharidases are affected by developmental and dietary factors in different ways. In many nonwhite ethnic groups, as well as in almost all other mammals, lactase activity markedly decreases after weaning in the postnatal period. The regulation of this decreased lactase activity is genetically determined. (5) N45-3 The other oligosaccharidases do not decrease in the postnatal period. In addition, long-term feeding of sucrose upregulates sucrase activity. In contrast, fasting reduces sucrase activity much more than it reduces lactase activity. In general, lactase activity is both more susceptible to enterocyte injury (e.g., following viral enteritis) and slower to recover from damage than is other oligosaccharidase activity. Thus, reduced lactase activity (as a consequence of both genetic regulation and environmental effects) has substantial clinical significance in that lactose ingestion may result in a range of symptoms in affected individuals (Fig. 45-4A, Box 45-1).

# N45-2 Oligosaccharidases 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The oligosaccharidases are large integral membrane proteins that are anchored to the apical membrane by a transmembrane stalk; $>90 \%$ of the protein is extracellular. Villous epithelial cells synthesize the disaccharidases via the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35). The proteins undergo extensive N-linked and O-linked glycosylation in the Golgi and then traffic to the apical membrane.

Sucrase-isomaltase is a special case. After the insertion of the single sucrase-isomaltase peptide (including its transmembrane stalk) into the brush-border membrane, pancreatic proteases cleave the peptide between the sucrase and isomaltase moieties. After this cleavage, the isomaltase moiety remains
continuous with the transmembrane stalk, and the sucrase moiety remains attached to the isomaltase moiety by van der Waals forces. Thus, sucrase-isomaltase differs from the other two oligosaccharidases in that the mature protein consists of two peptide chains (encoded by the same mRNA nonetheless), each with a distinct catalytic site and distinct substrate specificities.

See eFigure 45-1 for a summary of the composition of sugars and oligosaccharides. As we saw in the text, sucrase is unique in splitting sucrose, and the isomaltase is unique in splitting the $\alpha-1,6$ linkage of $\alpha$-limit dextrins. The table lists the enzymatic specificities for each of the brush-border oligosaccharidases.

# N45-3 Lactose Intolerance 

## Contributed by Henry Binder

Some authors object to the statement that lactose intolerance in adults is a lactase "deficiency" and instead propose that the normal course of events is for lactase activity to decline after weaning. According to one view, lactase "persistence" evolved in certain human populations after the domestication of herd animals allowed the consumption of nonhuman milk. This hypothesis could account for the geographical distribution of lactose intolerance in humans.

## BOX 45-1 Lactase Deficiency

Primary lactase deficiency is most prevalent in nonwhites, and it also occurs in some whites. Primary lactase deficiency represents an isolated deficiency of lactase, with all other brush-border enzymes being at normal levels and without any histological abnormalities. Lactase activity decreases after weaning; the time course of its reduction is determined by hereditary factors. Ingestion of lactose in the form of milk and milk products by individuals with decreased amounts of small-intestinal lactase activity may be associated with a range of gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, cramps, and flatus, or with no discernible symptoms. Several factors determine whether individuals with lactase deficiency experience symptoms after ingestion of lactose, including rate of gastric emptying, transit time through the small intestine, and, most importantly, the ability of colonic bacteria to metabolize lactose to SCFAs, 0 N45-1 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{H}_{2}$. Figure 45-4A shows the rise of plasma [glucose] following the ingestion of either lactose or glucose in adults with normal lactase levels. This figure also shows that the $\left|\mathrm{H}_{2}\right|$ in the breath rises only slightly following the ingestion of either lactose or glucose in individuals with normal lactase levels. Figure 45-4B shows that in individuals with primary lactase deficiency, the ingestion of lactose leads to a much smaller rise in plasma [glucose], although the ingestion of glucose itself leads to a normal rise in plasma [glucose]. Thus, no defect in glucose absorption per se is present, but simply a markedly reduced capacity to hydrolyze lactose to glucose and galactose. In lactase-deficient individuals, breath $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ is markedly increased after lactose ingestion because nonabsorbed lactose is metabolized by colonic bacteria to $\mathrm{H}_{2}$, which is absorbed into the blood and is subsequently excreted by the lungs. In contrast, the rise in breath $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ after the ingestion of glucose is normal in these individuals.

Treatment for symptomatic individuals with primary lactase deficiency is reduction or elimination of consumption of milk and milk products or the use of milk products treated with a commercial lactase preparation.

## CARBOHYDRATE ABSORPTION

The three monosaccharide products of carbohydrate digestion-glucose, galactose, and fructose-are absorbed by the small intestine in a two-step process involving their uptake across the apical membrane into the epithelial cell and their coordinated exit across the basolateral membrane (see Fig. 45-3C). Na/glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) is the membrane protein responsible for glucose and galactose uptake at the apical membrane. The exit of all three monosaccharides across the basolateral membrane uses a facilitated sugar transporter (GLUT2). Because SGLT1 cannot carry fructose, the apical step of fructose absorption occurs by the facilitated diffusion of fructose via GLUT5. Thus, although two different apical membrane transport mechanisms exist for glucose and fructose uptake, a single transporter (GLUT2) is responsible for the movement of both monosaccharides across the basolateral membrane.

## BOX 45-2 Glucose-Galactose Malabsorption

Molecular studies have been performed on jejunal mucosa from patients with so-called glucose-galactose malabsorption (or monosaccharide malabsorption). These individuals have diarrhea when they ingest dietary sugars that are normally absorbed by SGLT1. This diarrhea results from both reduced small-intestinal $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and fluid absorption (as a consequence of the defect in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled monosaccharide absorption) and fluid secretion secondary to the osmotic effects of nonabsorbed monosaccharide. Eliminating the monosaccharides glucose and galactose, as well as the disaccharide lactose (i.e., glucose + galactose), from the diet eliminates the diarrhea. The monosaccharide fructose, which crosses the apical membrane via GLUT5, does not induce diarrhea. Early studies identified the abnormality in this hereditary disorder as a defect at the apical membrane that is presumably related to defective or absent SGLT1. Molecular studies of SGLT1 have revealed multiple mutations that result in single amino-acid substitutions in SGLT1, each of which prevents the transport of glucose by SGLT1 in affected individuals. Patients with glucose-galactose malabsorption do not have glycosuria (i.e., glucose in the urine), because glucose reabsorption by the proximal tubule normally occurs via both SGLT1 and SGLT2 (see p. 772).

## SGLT1 is responsible for the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled uptake of glucose and galactose across the apical membrane

The uptake of glucose across the apical membrane via SGLT1 (Fig. 45-5A) represents active transport, because the glucose influx occurs against the glucose concentration gradient (see pp. 121-122). Glucose uptake across the apical membrane is energized by the electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient, which in turn is maintained by the extrusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the basolateral membrane by the Na-K pump. This type of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven glucose transport is an example of secondary active transport (see p. 115). Inhibition of the Na-K pump reduces active glucose absorption by decreasing the apical membrane $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient and thus decreasing the driving force for glucose entry.

The affinity of SGLT1 for glucose is markedly reduced in the absence of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The varied affinity of SGLT1 for different monosaccharides reflects its preference for specific molecular configurations. SGLT1 has two structural requirements for monosaccharides: (1) a hexose in a D configuration, and (2) a hexose that can form a six-membered pyranose ring (see Fig. 45-5B). SGLT1 does not absorb L-glucose, which has the wrong stereochemistry, and it does not absorb D-fructose, which forms a five-membered ring (Box 45-2). 0 N45-4

## The GLUT transporters mediate the facilitated diffusion of fructose at the apical membrane and of all three monosaccharides at the basolateral membrane

Early work showed that fructose absorption is independent of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$but has characteristics of both a carrier-mediated and a passive process. These observations show that the small intestine has separate transport systems for glucose

# N45-4 Na/Glucose Cotransporters 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Because the membrane potential across the luminal membrane is 40 to 50 mV (cell interior negative), and intracellular $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$is far less than luminal $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$, a "downhill" electrochemical $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient exists across the apical membrane that is the primary driving force for the uptake of glucose (and other actively transported monosaccharides) by SGLT1 (see pp. 121-122).

Glucose uptake at the apical membrane has other characteristics of a carrier-mediated active transport process, including saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition, and energy dependence.

SGLT1 belongs to the SLC5 family of transporters that couple $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$to monosaccharides and other small molecules. These membrane proteins have 14 predicted membranespanning segments. The gene for SGLT1 has been localized to human chromosome 22. Kinetic studies of the SGLT1 expressed in host cells have confirmed many of the characteristics of the Na/glucose cotransport system that had been identified in native tissue. Expression studies have established that the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$:sugar stoichiometry of SGLT1 is a 2:1 ratio. Its cousins SGLT2 and SGLT3 both have an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}:$sugar stoichiometry of $1: 1$.

For a discussion of the stereospecificity of sugars, see the biochemistry text by Voet and Voet, page 254 (Fig. 10-4).

Fructose uptake across the apical membrane is mediated by GLUT5, a member of the GLUT family of transport proteins (see p. 114). GLUT5 is present mainly in the jejunum. ( $\bigcirc$ N45-5

The efflux of glucose, fructose, and galactose across the basolateral membrane also occurs by facilitated diffusion. The characteristics of the basolateral sugar transporter, identified as GLUT2, are similar to those of other sugar transport systems in erythrocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes. GLUT2 has no homology to SGLT1 but is $41 \%$ identical to GLUT5, which is responsible for the uptake of fructose from the lumen.

## PROTEIN DIGESTION

## Proteins require hydrolysis to oligopeptides or amino acids before absorption in the small intestine

With the exception of antigenic amounts of dietary protein that are absorbed intact, proteins must first be digested
![bo604869338f](bo604869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-6 Action of luminal, brush-border, and cytosolic peptidases. Pepsin from the stomach and the five pancreatic proteases hydrolyze proteins-both dietary and endogenous-to single amino acids, AA, or to oligopeptides, (AA) ${ }_{2}$. These reactions occur in the lumen of the stomach or small intestine. A variety of peptidases at the brush borders of enterocytes then progressively hydrolyze oligopeptides to amino acids. The enterocyte directly absorbs some of the small oligopeptides via the action of the H/oligopeptide cotransporter PepT1. These small peptides are digested to amino acids by peptidases in the cytoplasm of the enterocyte.
into their constituent oligopeptides and amino acids before being taken up by the enterocytes. Digestion-absorption occurs through four major pathways. First, several luminal enzymes (i.e., proteases) from the stomach and pancreas may hydrolyze proteins to peptides and then to amino acids, which are then absorbed (Fig. 45-6). Second, luminal enzymes may digest proteins to peptides, but enzymes present at the brush border digest the peptides to amino acids, which are then absorbed. Third, luminal enzymes may digest proteins to peptides, which are themselves taken up as oligopeptides by the enterocytes. Further digestion of the oligopeptides by cytosolic enzymes yields intracellular amino acids, which are moved by transporters across the basolateral membrane into the blood. Fourth, luminal enzymes may digest dietary proteins to oligopeptides, which are taken up by enterocytes via an endocytotic process (Fig. 45-7) and moved directly into the blood. Overall, protein digestion-absorption is very efficient; $<4 \%$ of ingested nitrogen is excreted in the stool.

The protein that is digested and absorbed in the small intestine comes from both dietary and endogenous sources. Dietary protein in developed countries amounts to 70 to $100 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. This amount is far in excess of minimum daily

# N45-5 Facilitated Diffusion of Monosaccharides by the GLUT transporters 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The GLUT transporters are part of the SLC2 family of hexose and polyol transporters. Based on hydropathy analysis and other data, these proteins are believed to have 12 transmembrane segments. Note that the GLUT transporters (see p. 114) have no homology to Na/glucose cotransporters-or SGLTs (see pp. 121-122).

GLUT2 is a basolateral membrane transport protein that carries glucose, galactose, and fructose. It consists of 524 amino acids.

GLUT5 is an apical membrane protein that carries fructose. It consists of 501 amino acids, and its mRNA has been primarily identified in the jejunum. GLUT5 has $41 \%$ homology to GLUT2.

requirements and represents $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of energy intake. In contrast, dietary protein content in developing countries in Africa is often $50 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Deficiency states are rare unless intake is markedly reduced.

Proteins are encoded by messenger RNA (mRNA) and consist of 20 different amino acids. Nine of these amino acids are essential (see Table 58-2); that is, they are not synthesized in adequate amounts by the body and thus must be derived from either animal or plant protein sources. In addition, cells synthesize some other amino acids by post-translational modifications: $\gamma$-carboxyglutamic acid, hydroxylysine, 4-hydroxyproline, and 3-hydroxyproline. Protein digestion is influenced by the amino-acid composition of the protein, by the source of protein, and by food processing. Thus, proteins rich in proline and hydroxyproline are digested relatively less completely. Cooking, storage, and dehydration also reduce the completeness of digestion. In general, protein derived from animal sources is digested more completely than plant protein.

Figure 45-7 Absorption of whole proteins. Both enterocytes and specialized $M$ cells can take up intact proteins. The more abundant enterocytes can endocytose far more total protein than can the $M$ cells. However, the lysosomal proteases in the enterocytes degrade $\sim 90 \%$ of this endocytosed protein. The less abundant $M$ cells take up relatively little intact protein, but about half of this emerges intact at the basolateral membrane. There, immunocompetent cells process the target antigens and then transfer them to lymphocytes, initiating an immune response.

In addition to protein from dietary sources, significant amounts of endogenous protein are secreted into the gastrointestinal tract, then conserved by protein digestion and absorption. Such endogenous sources represent $\sim 50 \%$ of the total protein entering the small intestine and include enzymes, hormones, and immunoglobulins present in salivary, gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and jejunal secretions. A second large source of endogenous protein is desquamated intestinal epithelial cells as well as plasma proteins that the small intestine secretes.

Neonates can absorb substantial amounts of intact protein from colostrum (see p. 1146) through the process of endocytosis. This mechanism is developmentally regulated and in humans remains active only until $\sim 6$ months of age. In adults, proteins are almost exclusively digested to their constituent amino acids and dipeptides, tripeptides, or tetrapeptides before absorption. However, even adults absorb small amounts of intact proteins. These absorbed proteins can be important in inducing immune responses to dietary proteins.

## Luminal digestion of protein involves both gastric and pancreatic proteases, and yields amino acids and oligopeptides

Both gastric and pancreatic proteases, unlike the digestive enzymes for carbohydrates and lipids, are secreted as proenzymes that require conversion to their active form for protein hydrolysis to occur. The gastric chief cells secrete pepsinogen. We discuss the pH -dependent activation of pepsinogen on pages 873-874. Pepsin has a maximal hydrolytic activity between pH 1.8 and 3.5 , and becomes irreversibly inactivated at above pH 7.2. Pepsin is an endopeptidase with primary specificity for peptide linkages of aromatic and larger neutral amino acids. Although pepsin in the stomach partially digests $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of dietary protein, pepsin hydrolysis is not absolutely necessary; patients with either total gastrectomies or pernicious anemia ( $\bigcirc$ N45-6 (who do not secrete acid and thus whose intragastric pH is always $>7$ ) do not have increased fecal nitrogen excretion.

Five pancreatic enzymes (Table 45-2) participate in protein digestion and are secreted as inactive proenzymes. Trypsinogen is initially activated by a jejunal brush-border enzyme, enterokinase (enteropeptidase), by the cleavage of a hexapeptide, thereby yielding trypsin. Trypsin not only autoactivates trypsinogen but also activates the other pancreatic proteolytic proenzymes. The secretion of proteolytic enzymes as proenzymes, with subsequent luminal activation,

# N45-6 Pernicious Anemia

The close relationship between acid and gastrin release is clearly manifested in individuals with impaired acid secretion. In pernicious anemia, atrophy of the gastric mucosa in the corpus and an absence of parietal cells result in a lack in the secretion of both gastric acid and intrinsic factor (IF). Many patients with pernicious anemia exhibit antibody-mediated immunity against their parietal cells, and many of these patients also produce anti-IF autoantibodies.

Because IF is required for cobalamin absorption in the ileum, the result is impaired cobalamin absorption. In contrast, the antrum is normal. Moreover, plasma gastrin levels are markedly elevated as a result of the absence of intraluminal acid, which normally triggers gastric D cells to release somatostatin (see pp. 868-870); this, in turn, inhibits antral gastrin release (see Box 42-1). Because parietal cells are absent, the elevated plasma gastrin levels are not associated with enhanced gastric acid secretion.

The clinical complications of cobalamin deficiency evolve over a period of years. Patients develop megaloblastic anemia (in which the circulating red blood cells are enlarged), a distinctive form of glossitis, and a neuropathy. The earliest neurological findings are those of peripheral neuropathy, as manifested by paresthesias and slow reflexes, as well as impaired senses of touch, vibration, and temperature. If untreated, the disease will ultimately involve the spinal cord, particularly the dorsal columns, thus producing weakness and ataxia. Memory impairment, depression, and dementia can also result. Parenteral administration of cobalamin reverses and prevents the manifestations of pernicious anemia, but it does not influence parietal cells or restore gastric secretion of either IF or intraluminal acid.

prevents pancreatic autodigestion before enzyme secretion into the intestine.

Pancreatic proteolytic enzymes are either exopeptidases or endopeptidases and function in an integrated manner. Trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase are endopeptidases with affinity for peptide bonds adjacent to specific amino acids, so that their action results in the production of oligopeptides with two to six amino acids. In contrast, the exopeptidases-carboxypeptidase A and carboxypeptidase B -hydrolyze peptide bonds adjacent to the carboxyl (C) terminus, which results in the release of individual amino acids. The coordinated action of these pancreatic proteases converts $\sim 70 \%$ of luminal amino nitrogen to oligopeptides and $\sim 30 \%$ to free amino acids.

## Brush-border peptidases fully digest some oligopeptides to amino acids, whereas cytosolic peptidases digest oligopeptides that directly enter the enterocyte

Small peptides present in the small-intestinal lumen after digestion by gastric and pancreatic proteases undergo further hydrolysis by peptidases at the brush border (see Fig. 45-6). Multiple peptidases are present both on the brush border and in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells. This distribution of cell-associated peptidases stands in contrast to that of the oligosaccharidases, which are found only at the brush border. Because each peptidase recognizes only a limited repertoire of peptide bonds, and because the oligopeptides to be digested contain 24 different amino acids, large numbers of peptidases are required to ensure the hydrolysis of peptides.

As we discuss below, a transporter on the apical membrane of enterocytes can take up small oligopeptides, primarily dipeptides and tripeptides. Once inside the cell, these oligopeptides may be further digested by cytoplasmic peptidases. The brush-border and cytoplasmic peptidases have substantially different characteristics. For example, the brush-border peptidases have affinity for relatively larger oligopeptides (three to eight amino acids), whereas the cytoplasmic peptidases primarily hydrolyze dipeptides and tripeptides. Because the brush-border and cytoplasmic enzymes often have different biochemical properties (e.g., heat lability and electrophoretic mobility), it is evident that the peptidases in the brush border and cytoplasm are distinct, independently regulated molecules.

Like the pancreatic proteases, each of the several brushborder peptidases is an endopeptidase, an exopeptidase, or a dipeptidase with affinity for specific peptide bonds. The exopeptidases are either carboxypeptidases, which release C-terminal amino acids, or aminopeptidases, which hydrolyze the amino acids at the amino ( N )-terminal end. Cytoplasmic peptidases are relatively less numerous.

## PROTEIN, PEPTIDE, AND AMINO-ACID ABSORPTION

## Absorption of whole protein by apical endocytosis occurs primarily during the neonatal period

During the postnatal period, intestinal epithelial cells absorb protein by endocytosis, a process that provides a mechanism
for transfer of passive immunity from mother to child. The uptake of intact protein by the epithelial cell ceases by the sixth month; the cessation of this protein uptake, called closure, is hormonally mediated. For example, administration of corticosteroids during the postnatal period induces closure and reduces the time that the intestine can absorb significant amounts of whole protein.

The adult intestine can absorb finite amounts of intact protein and polypeptides. Uncertainty exists regarding the cellular route of absorption, as well as the relationship of the mechanism of protein uptake in adults to that in neonates. Enterocytes can take up by endocytosis a small amount of intact protein, most of which is degraded in lysosomes (see Fig. 45-7). A small amount of intact protein appears in the interstitial space. The uptake of intact protein also occurs through a second, more specialized route. In the small intestine, immediately overlying Peyer's patches (follicles of lymphoid tissue in the lamina propria), $\mathbf{M}$ cells replace the usual enterocytes on the surface of the gut. M cells have few microvilli and are specialized for protein uptake. They have limited ability for lysosomal protein degradation; rather, they package ingested proteins (i.e., antigens) in clathrin-coated vesicles, which they secrete at their basolateral membranes into the lamina propria. There, immunocompetent cells process the target antigens and transfer them to lymphocytes to initiate an immune response. Although protein uptake in adults may not have nutritional value, such uptake is clearly important in mucosal immunity and probably is involved in one or more disease processes.

## The apical absorption of dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides occurs via an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-driven cotransporter

Virtually all absorbed protein products exit the villous epithelial cell and enter the blood as individual amino acids. Substantial portions of these amino acids are released in the lumen of the small intestine by luminal proteases and brush-border peptidases and, as we discuss below, move across the apical membranes of enterocytes via several amino-acid transport systems (see Fig. 45-6). However, substantial amounts of protein are absorbed from the intestinal lumen as dipeptides, tripeptides, or tetrapeptides and then hydrolyzed to amino acids by intracellular peptidases.

The transporter responsible for the uptake of luminal oligopeptides (Fig. 45-8A) is distinct from the various aminoacid transporters. Furthermore, administering an amino acid as a peptide (e.g., the dipeptide glycylglycine) results in a higher blood level of the amino acid than administering an equivalent amount of the same amino acid as a monomer (e.g., glycine; see Fig. 45-8B). One possible explanation for this effect is that the oligopeptide cotransporter, which carries multiple amino acids rather than a single amino acid into the cell, may simply be more effective than amino-acid transporters in transferring amino-acid monomers into the cell. This accelerated peptide absorption has been referred to as a kinetic advantage and raises the question of the usefulness of the enteral administration of crystalline amino acids to patients with impaired intestinal function or catabolic deficiencies. The evidence for a specific transport process for dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides comes from direct

![bo624869338f](bo624869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-8 Absorption of oligopeptides. A, The H/oligopeptide cotransporter PepT1 moves dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides into the enterocyte, across the apical membrane. Peptidases in the cytoplasm hydrolyze the oligopeptides into their constituent amino acids, which then exit across the basolateral membrane via one of three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent amino-acid transporters. B, If glycine is present in the lumen only as a free amino acid, then the enterocyte absorbs it only via apical amino-acid transporters. However, if the same amount of glycine is present in the lumen in the form of the dipeptide glycylglycine, the rate of appearance of glycine in the blood is about twice as high. Thus, PepT1, which moves several amino-acid monomers for each turnover of the transporter, is an effective mechanism for absorbing "amino acids."

Oligopeptide uptake is an active process driven not by an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient, but by a proton gradient. Oligopeptide uptake occurs via an H/oligopeptide cotransporter known as PepT1 (SLC15A1; see p. 123), which is also present in the renal proximal tubule. PepT1 also appears to be responsible for the intestinal uptake of certain dipeptide-like antibiotics (e.g., oral amino-substituted cephalosporins). As noted above, after their uptake, dipeptides, tripeptides, and tetrapeptides are usually hydrolyzed by cytoplasmic peptidases to their constituent amino acids, the forms in which they are transported out of the cell across the basolateral membrane. Because peptides are almost completely hydrolyzed to amino acids intracellularly, few peptides appear in the portal vein. Proline-containing dipeptides, which are relatively resistant to hydrolysis, are the primary peptides present in the circulation.

## Amino acids enter enterocytes via one or more group-specific apical transporters

Multiple amino-acid transport systems have been identified and characterized in various nonepithelial cells. The absorption of amino acids across the small intestine requires sequential movement across both the apical and basolateral membranes of the villous epithelial cell. Although the amino-acid transport systems have overlapping affinities for various amino acids, the consensus is that at least seven distinct transport systems are present at the apical membrane (see Table 36-1); we discuss the basolateral amino-acid
transporters in the next section. Whereas many apical amino-acid transporters are probably unique to epithelial cells, some of those at the basolateral membrane are probably the same as in nonepithelial cells.

The predominant apical amino-acid transport system is system $\mathbf{B}^{0}$ (SLC6A19, SLC6A15; see Table 36-1) and results in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent uptake of neutral amino acids. As is the case for glucose uptake (see p. 919), uphill movement of neutral amino acids is driven by an inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ gradient that is maintained by the basolateral $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump. The uptake of amino acids by system $\mathrm{B}^{0}$ is an electrogenic process and represents another example of secondary active transport. It transports amino acids with an L-stereo configuration and an amino group in the $\alpha$ position. System $\mathrm{B}^{0+}$ (SLC6A14) is similar to system $\mathrm{B}^{0}$ but has broader substrate specificity. System $\mathrm{b}^{0+}$ (SLC7A9/SLC3A1 dimer) differs from $\mathrm{B}^{0+}$ mainly in being independent of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$.

Other apical carrier-mediated transport mechanisms exist for anionic (i.e., acidic) $\alpha$ amino acids, cationic (i.e., basic) $\alpha$ amino acids, $\beta$ amino acids, and imino acids (see Table 36-1). Because these transporters have overlapping affinities for amino acids, and because of species differences as well as segmental and developmental differences among the transporters, it has been difficult to establish a comprehensive model of apical membrane amino-acid transport in the mammalian small intestine (Box 45-3).

## At the basolateral membrane, amino acids exit enterocytes via $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent transporters and enter via $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent transporters

Amino acids appear in the cytosol of intestinal villous cells as the result either of their uptake across the apical

# BOX 45-3 Defects in Apical Amino-Acid Transport: Hartnup Disease and Cystinuria 

H artnup disease and cystinuria are hereditary disorders of amino-acid transport across the apical membrane. These autosomal recessive disorders are associated with both small-intestine and renal-tubule abnormalities (see Box 36-1) in the absorption of neutral amino acids in the case of Hartnup disease and of cationic (i.e., basic) amino acids and cystine in the case of cystinuria.

The clinical signs of Hartnup disease are most evident in children and include the skin changes of pellagra, cerebellar ataxia, and psychiatric abnormalities. In Hartnup disease, the absorption of neutral amino acids by system $\mathrm{B}^{0}$ (SLC6A19) in the small intestine is markedly reduced, whereas that of cationic amino acids is intact (Fig. 45-9).

The principal manifestation of cystinuria is the formation of kidney stones. In cystinuria, the absorption of cationic amino acids by system $\mathrm{b}^{0+}$ (SLC7A9/SLC3A1 dimer) is abnormal as a result of mutations in SLC7A9 or SLC3A1, but absorption of neutral amino acids is normal.

Because neither of these diseases involves the oligopeptide cotransporter, the absorption of oligopeptides containing either
neutral or cationic amino acids is normal in both diseases. Only $10 \%$ of patients with Hartnup disease have clinical evidence of protein deficiency (e.g., pellagra) commonly associated with defects in protein or amino-acid absorption. The lack of evidence of protein deficiency is a consequence of the presence of more than one transport system for different amino acids, as well as a separate transporter for oligopeptides. Thus, oligopeptides containing neutral amino acids are absorbed normally in Hartnup disease, and oligopeptides with cationic amino acids are absorbed normally in cystinuria.

These two genetic diseases also emphasize the existence of amino-acid transport mechanisms on the basolateral membrane that are distinct and separate from the apical amino-acid transporters. Thus, in both Hartnup disease and cystinuria, oligopeptides are transported normally across the apical membrane and are hydrolyzed to amino acids in the cytosol, and the resulting neutral and cationic amino acids are readily transported out of the cell across the basolateral membrane.
![bo634869338f](bo634869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-9 Genetic disorders of apical amino-acid transport. A, In Hartnup disease, an autosomal recessive disorder, the apical system $\mathrm{B}^{0}$ (SLC6A19) is defective. As a result, the absorption of neutral amino acids, such as L-phenylalanine, is reduced. However, the absorption of L-cystine (i.e., Cys-S-S-Cys) and cationic (i.e., basic) amino acids (e.g., L-arginine) remains intact. The enterocyte can absorb L-phenylalanine normally if the amino acid is present in the form of the dipeptide L-phenylalanyl-L-leucine, inasmuch as the oligopeptide cotransporter PepT1 is normal. B, In cystinuria, an autosomal recessive disorder, the apical system $b^{0+}$ (SLC7A9/SLC3A1 dimer) is defective. As a result, the absorption of L-cystine and cationic amino acids (e.g., L-arginine) is reduced. However, the absorption of amino acids that use System $B^{0}$ (e.g., L-alanine) is normal. The enterocyte can absorb L-arginine normally if the amino acid is present in the form of the dipeptide L-arginyl-L-leucine.

## BOX 45-4 Defect in Basolateral Amino-Acid Transport: Lysinuric Protein Intolerance

Lysinuric protein intolerance is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of amino-acid transport across the basolateral membrane (Fig. 45-10). Evidence indicates impaired cationic amino-acid transport, and symptoms of malnutrition are seen. It appears that the defect is in system $\mathrm{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{L}$, which is located solely on the basolateral membrane. System $\mathrm{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{L}$ has two subtypes, y'LAT1 (SLC7A7/SLC3A2 dimer) and y'LAT2 (SLC7A6/SLC3A2 dimer). Mutations in the SLC7A7 gene (subtype y'LAT1) cause the disease lysinuric protein intolerance. These patients exhibit normal absorption of cationic amino acids across the apical membrane. Unlike in Hartnup disease or cystinuria, in which the enterocytes can absorb the amino acid normally if it is presented as an oligopeptide, in lysinuric protein intolerance the enterocytes cannot absorb the amino acid regardless of whether the amino acid is "free" or is part of an oligopeptide. These observations are best explained by hypothesizing that the patients hydrolyze intracellular oligopeptides properly but have a defect in the transport of cationic amino acids across the basolateral membrane. This defect is present not only in the small intestine but also in hepatocytes and kidney cells, and perhaps in nonepithelial cells as well.
membrane or of the hydrolysis of oligopeptides that had entered the apical membrane (see Fig. 45-6). The enterocyte subsequently uses $\sim 10 \%$ of the absorbed amino acids for intracellular protein synthesis.

Movement of amino acids across the basolateral membrane is bidirectional; the movement of any one amino acid can occur via one or more amino-acid transporters. At least six amino-acid transport systems are present in the basolateral membrane (see Table 36-1). Three amino-acid transport processes on the basolateral membrane mediate amino-acid exit from the cell into the blood and thus complete the process of protein assimilation. Two other amino-acid transporters mediate uptake from the blood for the purposes of cell nutrition. The three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent amino-acid transport systems appear to mediate amino-acid movement out of the epithelial cell into blood. The two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent processes facilitate their movement into the epithelial cell. Indeed, these two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent transporters resemble those that are also present in nonpolar cells.

In general, the amino acids incorporated into protein within villous cells are derived more from those that enter across the apical membrane than from those that enter across the basolateral membrane. In contrast, epithelial cells in the intestinal crypt derive almost all their amino acids for protein synthesis from the circulation; crypt cells do not take up amino acids across their apical membrane (Box 45-4).

## LIPID DIGESTION

## Natural lipids of biological origin are sparingly soluble in water

Lipids in the diet are derived from animals or plants and are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and a smaller amount
![bo644869338f](bo644869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-10 Genetic disorder of basolateral amino-acid transport. Lysinuric protein intolerance is an autosomal recessive defect in which the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent $\mathrm{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{L}$ amino-acid transporter on the apical and basolateral membranes is defective. However, the absence of apical $\mathrm{y}^{\prime} \mathrm{L}$ (SLC7A6/ SLC3A2 or SLC7A7/SLC3A2 dimers) does not present a problem because $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent amino-acid transporters can take up lysine, and PepT1 can take up lysine-containing oligopeptides (Lys-XX). However, there is no other mechanism for moving lysine out of the enterocyte across the basolateral membrane.
of oxygen. Some lipids also contain small but functionally important amounts of nitrogen and phosphorus (Fig. 45-11). Lipids are typified by their preferential solubility in organic solvents compared with water. A widely used indicator of the lipidic nature of a compound is its octanol-water partition coefficient, which for most lipids is between $10^{4}$ and $10^{7}$.

The biological fate of lipids depends critically on their chemical structure as well as on their interactions with water and other lipids in aqueous body fluids (e.g., intestinal contents and bile). Thus, lipids have been classified according to their physicochemical interactions with water. Lipids may be either nonpolar and thus very insoluble in water (e.g., cholesteryl esters and carotene) or polar and thus interacting with water to some degree. Even polar lipids are only amphiphilic; that is, they have both polar (hydrophilic) and nonpolar (hydrophobic) groups. Polar lipids range from the insoluble, nonswelling amphiphiles (e.g., triacylglycerols) to the soluble amphiphiles (e.g., bile acids). Added in small amounts, insoluble polar lipids form stable monolayers on the surface of water (see Fig. 2-1C), whereas the soluble amphiphiles do not. The physicochemical behavior in bulk solution varies from insolubility-as is the case with triacylglycerols (TAGs) and cholesterol-to the formation of various macroaggregates, such as liquid crystals and micelles. Less-soluble lipids may be incorporated into the macroaggregates of the more polar lipids and are thus stably maintained in aqueous solutions.

## Dietary lipids are predominantly TAGs

The term fat is generally used to refer to TAGs-formerly called triglycerides-but it is also used loosely to refer to lipids in general. Of the fat in an adult diet, $>90 \%$ is TAGs, which are commonly long-chain fatty acyl esters of glycerol, a trihydroxyl alcohol. The three esterification (i.e., acylation) positions on the glycerol backbone that are occupied by

Figure 45-11 Chemical formulas of some common lipids. The example in $\mathbf{A}$ is stearic acid, a fully saturated fatty acid with 18 carbon atoms. B shows glycerol, a trihydroxy alcohol, with hydroxyl groups in positions $s n 1, s n 2$, and $s n 3$. In $\mathbf{C}$, the left $s n 1$ - and center $s n 2$-fatty acids are palmitic acid, a fully saturated fatty acid with 16 carbon atoms. The rightmost sn3-fatty acid is palmitoleic acid, which is also a 16 -carbon structure, but with a double bond between carbons 9 and 10. In $\mathbf{F}$, the left sn1-fatty acid is palmitic acid, and the right sn2-fatty acid is palmitoleic acid. In $\mathbf{I}$, the example is the result of esterifying cholesterol and palmitic acid.
hydroxyl groups are designated $\boldsymbol{s n 1}, \boldsymbol{s n 2}$, and $\boldsymbol{s n 3}$, according to a stereochemical numbering system adopted by an international committee on biochemical nomenclature (see Fig. 45-11C-E). At body temperature, fats are usually liquid droplets. Dietary fat is the body's only source of essential fatty acids, and its hydrolytic products promote the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (the handling of which is
discussed on p. 933). Fat is also the major nutrient responsible for postprandial satiety.

Typical adult Western diets contain $\sim 140 \mathrm{~g}$ of fat per day (providing $\sim 60 \%$ of the energy), which is more than the recommended intake of less than $\sim 70 \mathrm{~g}$ of fat per day ( $<30 \%$ of total dietary calories). The ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in TAGs is high in animal fats and low in

plant fats. Current guidelines suggest that only one third of lipid intake should be saturated fats. Cholesterol intake should be limited to $<300 \mathrm{mg} /$ day, and trans fatty acids avoided. Of the fats ingested, those that are liquid at room temperature should be emphasized, especially those that contain omega-3 (or n-3) fatty acids (5) N45-7 found especially in fish. Because of the high fat content of milk, newborn infants consume three to five times more lipid than adults, relative to body weight.

Approximately 5\% (4 to $6 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) of dietary lipids come from cell membranes and are phospholipids. Most phospholipids are glycerophospholipids. They consist of a glycerol backbone that is esterified at the first two positions to fatty acids and at the third position to a phosphate that in turn is esterified to a head group (see Fig. 2-2A-C). One of the glycerophospholipids, phosphatidylcholine (lecithin), is the predominant phospholipid (see Fig. 45-11F). The sphingolipids (see Fig. 2-2D, E), which have a serine rather than a glycerol backbone, form the other major class of membrane phospholipids.

The typical Western diet contains $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~g}$ of unesterified cholesterol (also derived from animal cell membranes; see Fig. 45-11H), whereas esterified cholesterol (see Fig. 45-11J) is usually found only in liver or food made from blood products. Traces of lipovitamins and provitamins (e.g., carotene) are present in dietary fat, which may also contain lipid-soluble toxins and carcinogens from the environment. These undesirable lipid-soluble chemicals-which include nitrosamines, aflatoxins, and polycyclic hydrocarbons such as benzo(a)pyrene-are all found in small amounts in margarine, vegetable oils, and other dietary fats. The diet also may contain skin lipids, which are chemically diverse and complex and are difficult to digest.

## Endogenous lipids are phospholipids and cholesterol from bile and membrane lipids from desquamated intestinal epithelial cells

The bile secreted into the intestine (see p. 957) plays a key role in the assimilation of dietary lipids, as we explain below. This bile contains phospholipid ( 10 to $15 \mathrm{~g} /$ day)-also predominantly phosphatidylcholine-and unesterified cholesterol (1 to $2 \mathrm{~g} /$ day). Quantitatively, these biliary lipids exceed those present in the diet by 2- to 4 -fold. Membrane lipids from desquamated intestinal cells account for a further 2 to 6 g of lipid for digestion. Dead bacteria contribute $\sim 10 \mathrm{~g} /$ day of lipids, mainly in the colon.

## The mechanical disruption of dietary lipids in the mouth and stomach produces an emulsion of lipid particles

The central process in the digestion of lipids is their hydrolysis in the aqueous milieu of the intestinal lumen. Lipid hydrolysis is catalyzed by lipases secreted by the glands and cells of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The products of lipolysis diffuse through the aqueous content of the intestinal lumen, traverse the so-called unstirred water layer and mucus barrier that line the intestinal epithelial surface, and enter the enterocyte for further processing. Because dietary lipids are insoluble in water, digestive lipases have evolved to
act more efficiently at oil-water interfaces than on watersoluble substrates.

A key step preliminary to lipid digestion is the transformation of ingested solid fat and oil masses into an emulsion of fine oil droplets in water. The emulsification of dietary fats begins with food preparation (grinding, marinating, blending, and cooking), followed by chewing and gastric churning (see pp. 876-877) caused by antral peristalsis against a closed pylorus. Emulsification of ingested lipids is enhanced when muscular movements of the stomach intermittently squirt the gastric contents into the duodenum and, conversely, when peristalsis of the duodenum propels the duodenal contents in retrograde fashion into the stomach through the narrow orifice of a contracted pylorus. The grinding action of the antrum also mixes food with the various digestive enzymes derived from the mouth and stomach. Intestinal peristalsis mixes luminal contents with pancreatic and biliary secretions. Together, these mechanical processes that reduce the size of the lipid droplets also dramatically increase their ratio of surface area to volume, thereby increasing the area of the oil-water interface.

The fine emulsion produced by the mechanical processes just outlined is stabilized by coating the emulsion droplets with membrane lipids, denatured protein, dietary polysaccharides, certain products of digestion-including fatty acids released by gastric lipase as well as fatty acids and monoacylglycerols (MAGs) from intestinal and pancreatic digestion-and biliary phospholipids and cholesterol. This coating prevents the lipid droplets from coalescing. Phospholipids and cholesterol are well suited as emulsion stabilizers because they are attracted to oil-water interfaces by virtue of their amphiphilic properties. Thus, they form a surface monomolecular layer on emulsion particles. The polar groups of the phospholipids and hydroxyl groups of cholesterol project into the water; the charges on the polar groups and their high degree of hydration prevent coalescence of the emulsion particles. The core of the emulsion particle is composed of TAG, which also contains cholesteryl esters and other nonpolar or weakly polar lipids. A very small fraction of the TAG in the lipid particle localizes to the particle surface. The fat in breast milk is already emulsified by proteins and phospholipids incorporated into the surface of fat droplets during lactation. Foods such as sauces, ice cream, and puddings are stably emulsified during their preparation.

## Lingual and gastric (acid) lipase initiate lipid digestion

In some species, but not in humans, a small amount of lipid digestion begins in the mouth, mediated by lingual lipase. In the stomach, both lingual lipase that is swallowed and a gastric lipase secreted by gastric chief cells digest substantial amounts of lipid. Human gastric lipase is a $42-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein whose secretion is stimulated by gastrin. Gastric lipase secretion is already well established in the neonatal period (unlike pancreatic lipase secretion), and thus gastric lipolysis is important for fat digestion in newborn infants. Gastric lipase is also important in the digestion of dietary fat in patients with pancreatic insufficiency, where it hydrolyzes approximately one third of the fat due to its preference for fatty acids at the sn3 position, leaving behind intact

# N45-7 Omega-3 Fatty Acids 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

eFigure 45-2 shows the structure of $\alpha$-linolenic acid (ALA), which is an 18-carbon fatty acid with three double bonds.

If we use the numbering system of chemists-which, as indicated by the blue numerals in the figure, assigns the carboxyl carbon as the No. 1 position-the three double bonds begin at positions 9,12 , and 15 . Thus, this fatty acid can be referred to as $18: 3 \Delta 9 \mathrm{c}, 12 \mathrm{c}, 15 \mathrm{c}$.

Alternatively, physiologists count from the opposite or methyl $\left(-\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)$ end of the carbon chain-also known as the $\boldsymbol{n}$ endstarting with the terminal or omega ( $\omega$ ) carbon. In eFigure $45-2$, we indicate this numbering system by the red numerals. The rationale for the $n$ numbering system is that the methyl end of the molecule is less susceptible to biochemical modification.

In this nomenclature, the double bond closest to the methyl carbon is termed the omega-3 or n-3 double bond, and fatty acids containing such a double bond are termed omega-3 or n-3 fatty acids. We would refer to $\alpha$-linolenic acid as $18: 3(n-3)$. Here the first double bond starts at the $n-3$ position and the other two double bonds each begin 3 carbons further down the chain (i.e., at $n-6$ and $n-9$ ).

sn1,2-diacylglycerols (DAGs; see Fig. 45-11D). Gastric and lingual-as well as pharyngeal-lipases belong to a family of serine hydrolases that have acidic pH optima ( pH 4 ), are stable in the acidic environment of the stomach, are resistant to digestion by pepsin, and are not inhibited by the surface layer of membrane lipids (emulsifiers) that envelopes TAG droplets. However, acid lipases are inactive at neutral pH and also are readily inactivated by pancreatic proteases (especially in the presence of bile salts) once they reach the small intestine. (4) N45-8

The carboxyl groups of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs), (4) N45-1 released from TAGs in the stomach, are protonated and insoluble at the acidic pH prevailing in the stomach. LCFAs are not absorbed in the stomach, but rather they remain in the core of the TAG droplets. In the more alkaline environment of the small intestine, the fatty acids become ionized and participate in emulsification of the lipid droplets. Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs), (4) N45-1 and SCFAs are mainly protonated in gastric juice during feeding and passively move across the gastric mucosa into portal blood. (4) N45-9

## Pancreatic (alkaline) lipase, colipase, milk lipase, and other esterases-aided by bile salts-complete lipid hydrolysis in the duodenum and jejunum

The process of fat digestion that begins in the stomach is completed in the proximal small intestine, predominantly by enzymes synthesized and secreted by pancreatic acinar cells (see p. 882) and carried into the duodenum in the pancreatic juice. In humans, a lipase found in human milk-the so-called bile salt-stimulated milk lipase-also digests fat. A similar lipase is found in the milk of relatively few other animal species. Milk lipase is stable during passage through the acid environment of the stomach, yet it is active at the alkaline pH of the duodenum and jejunum, where it hydrolyzes DAGs, MAGs, cholesteryl esters, and fat-soluble vitamin esters, as well as TAGs. Bile salts not only stimulate milk lipase activity but also protect the enzyme from proteolysis in the small intestine. Like gastric lipase, milk lipase is important for fat digestion in breast-fed infants.

Once the fatty acids generated in the stomach reach the duodenum, they trigger the release of CCK and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) from the duodenal mucosa. CCK stimulates the flow of bile into the duodenum by causing the gallbladder to contract and the sphincter of Oddi to relax (see pp. 961-962). CCK also stimulates the secretion of pancreatic enzymes, including lipases and esterases (see pp. 882-883). As we discuss below, LCFAs also facilitate the lipolytic action of pancreatic lipase.

The major lipolytic enzyme of pancreatic juice is a $48-\mathrm{kDa}$ carboxylic esterase known as pancreatic (TAG) lipase, sometimes referred to as colipase-dependent pancreatic lipase. In adults but not in infants, the active form of this enzyme is secreted into the duodenum at a level 1000-fold higher than that necessary to digest all dietary TAGs not hydrolyzed in the stomach. (5) N45-10 Full lipolytic activity of pancreatic lipase requires the presence of the small (10$\mathrm{kDa})$ protein cofactor called colipase, as well as an alkaline $\mathrm{pH}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, bile salts, and fatty acids. The pancreas secretes colipase in the pro form (i.e., procolipase), which has no
intrinsic lipolytic activity. Trypsin cleaves procolipase into colipase and an N-terminal pentapeptide, enterostatin. This cleavage is important because the newly formed colipase is a cofactor of pancreatic lipase, as we discuss below. In addition, the N-terminal pentapeptide may partially control satiety.

Pancreatic lipase is active only at the oil-water interface of a TAG droplet. However, surface emulsifier components (e.g., phospholipids, proteins, fatty acids) present at that interface inhibit lipase action. Bile-salt micelles also inhibit lipolysis by displacing the lipase from the oil-droplet surface. Colipase reverses this inhibition through interfacial binding, either by attaching first to the interface and serving as an anchor for the binding of the lipase, or by first forming a colipase-pancreatic lipase complex that then binds to the lipid interface. Colipase also can penetrate the phospholipid coating of the TAG emulsion. Bile-salt micelles bring the colipase closer to the interface. Because bile salts are nearby, they can participate in the solubilization and removal of the products of lipolysis released from the emulsion droplet. Fatty acids have a biphasic effect. Increasing levels at first enhance emulsification and augment lipolysis (probably by enhancing the binding of the colipase-lipase complex to the lipid interface). Further increases in fatty-acid levels cause product inhibition of lipase.

Studies of the crystal structure of pancreatic lipase have shown that when the enzyme is free in solution, the catalytic site of the lipase-located in a cleft in the molecule-is partly covered by a lid formed by a loop of its peptide chain. The interaction of the colipase and lipase with the interface causes a conformational change in the lipase molecule that opens the lid, thereby allowing lipid substrate to diffuse to the now-exposed catalytic site of the enzyme.

Pancreatic lipase mainly hydrolyzes the ester bonds of TAGs at the first and third positions of the glycerol backbone. The end products of such reactions are two fatty acids and a single sn2-MAG (2-MAG) (see Fig. 45-11E).

The pancreas secretes other enzymes that hydrolyze lipid esters. Carboxyl ester hydrolase is a pancreatic enzyme that is the same protein as bile salt-stimulated milk lipase. Like milk lipase, carboxyl ester hydrolase lacks substrate specificity and is active against a wide range of esters. Carboxyl ester hydrolase is probably the same enzyme as "pancreatic esterase," "cholesterol esterase," "lysophospholipase," and others. Among the many products of reactions catalyzed by this enzyme are free cholesterol and free glycerol.

The pancreas also secretes phospholipase $\mathbf{A}_{1}\left(\mathbf{P L A}_{2}\right)$, which is active against glycerophospholipids (but not sphingolipids), releasing a single sn2-fatty acid, which is usually an unsaturated fatty acid, to yield sn1-lysophospholipids (see Fig. 45-11G). Pancreatic PLA $_{2}$, secreted as a trypsinactivatable proenzyme, is effective at alkaline pH and requires bile salts and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for activity. A separate $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ in the small intestine, with a preference for phosphatidylglycerol, a common phospholipid in bacteria, is derived from Paneth cells, whereas phospholipase found in the colon probably comes from anaerobic flora there. In contrast to the human intestinal lipases, bacterial lipases are nonspecific with respect to substrates, have neutral or slightly acidic pH optima, are not inhibited by bile acids, and do not require cofactors. In the human colon, both TAGs and phospholipids are totally hydrolyzed by bacteria. Fecal fat is thus

In healthy adult humans, $\sim 15 \%$ of fat digestion occurs in the stomach. In patients with pancreatic insufficiency, however, the lack of pancreatic proteases and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the duodenal lumen may permit the continued action of gastric lipase after the gastric contents leave the stomach and enter the duodenum. Extended gastric lipase activity partly alleviates fat malabsorption resulting from pancreatic disease and pancreatic lipase deficiency.

## N45-9 Gastric Absorption of Mediumand Short-Chain Fatty Acids

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In aqueous solutions, fatty acids exist in both anionic ( $\mathrm{A}^{-}$) and neutral/protonated (HA) forms, according to the following equilibrium:

$$
\mathrm{HA} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{A}^{-}
$$

( $\mathbf{N E} 45-1$ )
All of the fatty acids, regardless of the length of the alkyl chain, are relatively water soluble when the fatty acids are in their anionic form. However, the solubility of the protonated forms of the fatty acids depends markedly on the length of the alkyl chain. Thus, as stated in the text, the protonated forms of the LCFAs are relatively water insoluble. On the other hand, the protonated forms of the MCFAs and SCFAs become progressively more water soluble.

The pK values for the equilibrium in Equation NE 45-1 are rather independent of the length of the alkyl chain. Indeed, all saturated fatty acids of physiological importance have pK values between those of the 2-carbon acetic acid ( $p K=4.76$ ) and the 3-carbon propionic acid ( $p K=4.87$ ). Only the 1-carbon formic acid has an appreciably lower pK value ( $\sim 3.75$ ). Thus, at the lowest gastric pH values, all fatty acids-long-chain, medium-chain, and short-chain-exist almost exclusively in the neutral/protonated (HA) forms. The major difference, as noted in the text, is that the protonated forms of the LCFAs, which are insoluble in water and thus largely partitioned into triacylglycerol droplets, are unavailable for uptake in the stomach. The protonated forms of the MCFAs and SCFAs are more water soluble and thus more available for passive absorption by nonionic diffusion (see p. 784) in the stomach.

generally present as fatty-acid soaps and sterols. Even in cases of severe fat malabsorption, intact acylglycerols are rarely found in the stools unless the patient has exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. The chemical test for stool fat, Sudan III staining, must be done in an acid environment because it depends on the property of Sudan III dye to partition into "oils" that contain protonated fatty acids.

## LIPID ABSORPTION

## Products of lipolysis enter the bulk water phase of the intestinal lumen as vesicles, mixed micelles, and monomers

After their secretion in pancreatic juice and bile, respectively, the various activated pancreatic lipases and biliary bile salts, phosphatidylcholine, and cholesterol adsorb to the surface of the emulsion droplets arriving from the stomach (Fig. 45-12A). The lipolytic products-MAGs, fatty acids (including long-chain species from gastric lipolysis) that are now ionized at duodenal pH 5.5 to 6.5 , lysophosphatidylcholine,
![bo674869338f](bo674869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-12 Breakdown of emulsion droplets to mixed micelles. A, The core of the emulsion droplet contains TAGs, DAGs, and cholesteryl esters. On the surface are fatty acids, MAGs, lysolecithins, and cholesterol. Adsorbed to the surface are pancreatic lipase and possibly bile salts. As the lipases hydrolyze the TAGs at the surface, the TAGs from the core replace them, causing the droplet to shrink. B, A multilamellar liquid-crystalline layer of fatty acids, MAGs, lysolecithins, cholesterol, and bile salts builds up on the surface of the emulsion droplet, causing a small piece to bud off as a multilamellar vesicle. C, The addition of more bile salts to the multilamellar vesicle thins out the lipid coating and converts the multilamellar vesicle to a unilamellar vesicle. D, Further addition of bile salts leads to formation of a mixed micelle, in which hydrophobic lipid tails face inward and polar head groups face outward.
and cholesterol-act as additional emulsifiers. As surface TAGs are hydrolyzed, they are replaced by TAGs from the core of the emulsion particle. As the emulsion droplets become progressively smaller, their surface area increases, so that the rate of hydrolysis increases. Initially, a crystalline calcium-fatty-acid soap phase forms near the surface of the TAG droplet, until the local free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is depleted. At the same time, a multilamellar liquid crystalline layer of fatty acids, MAGs, lysophosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and possibly bile salts builds up on the surface of the emulsion particle. This liquid crystalline layer buds off as a multilamellar liquid crystal vesicle (see Fig. 45-12B), which consists of several lipid bilayers. Bile-salt micelles transform these multilamellar vesicles into unilamellar vesicles (see Fig. 45-12C), which are single-lipid bilayers, and then into mixed micelles (see Fig. 45-12D) composed of bile salts and mixed lipids (i.e., fatty acids, MAG, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol).

Continued digestion by $\mathrm{PLA}_{2}$ and other esterases can still occur on the mixture of aggregates now present. If intestinal contents taken from humans during fat digestion are centrifuged, three phases separate. An oily layer floats on top
![bo684869338f](bo684869338f.jpg)

and contains fat droplets and lipolytic products that have not been solubilized by bile salts. A middle layer contains lipid vesicles, mixed lipid-bile-salt micelles, simple bile-salt micelles, and lipid monomers. Finally, a pellet contains debris, liquid crystals, and precipitated calcium soaps of fatty acids. Whereas most fat absorption in health is from the micellar phase of digested lipid, in situations in which intraluminal bile-salt concentrations are low (e.g., in newborns and patients with obstructive jaundice), lipid absorption can occur from vesicles.

## Lipids diffuse as mixed micelles and monomers through unstirred layers before crossing the jejunal enterocyte brush border

To reach the interior of the enterocyte, lipolytic products must cross several barriers. These include (1) the mucous gel layer that lines the intestinal epithelial surface, (2) the unstirred water layer (disequilibrium zone) contiguous with the enterocyte's apical membrane, and (3) the apical membrane itself. Although the mucous gel that lines the intestine is $95 \%$ water, its interstices provide a barrier to the free diffusion-from the bulk phase to the unstirred water layer-of lipid macroaggregates, particularly the various vesicles that exist in equilibrium with the mixed micelles and monomers. Because of this diffusion barrier, the unstirred water lying adjacent to the enterocyte's apical membrane is not in equilibrium with the bulk phase of water in the lumen. According to calculations based on the diffusion of various probes under different experimental conditions and luminal fluid flow rates, it was originally estimated that the unstirred water layer was several hundred micrometers thick and posed a significant barrier to the diffusion of lipid nutrients to the enterocyte brush border. It is now thought that the unstirred water layer is likely only $\sim 40 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick and does not constitute a major absorptive barrier.

For SCFAs and MCFAs, (1) N45-1 which are readily soluble in water, diffusion of these monomers through the unstirred water layer to the enterocyte is efficient. As fatty-acid chain length increases, the monomer's solubility in water decreases, whereas its partitioning into micelles increases. It is true that the diffusion of a single monomer through the aqueous barriers is speedier than that of a single micelle or vesicle. However, mixed-lipid micelles act as a reservoir to give the aqueous solution such a high effective concentration of fatty acids and other lipid products that the diffusion of these micelles is the most efficient mechanism for bringing lipolytic products to the enterocytes. Calculations suggest that, compared with monomers dissolved in water, vesicular solubilization increases the "concentration" of LCFAs (1) N45-1 near the enterocyte's brush-border membrane by a factor of 100,000 and micellar solubilization by a factor of $1,000,000$.

When the fatty-acid/bile-salt mixed micelles reach the enterocyte surface, they encounter an acidic microclimate generated by Na -H exchange at the brush-border membrane. It is postulated that fatty acids now become protonated and leave the mixed micelle to enter the enterocyte. The uptake of fatty acids could occur by nonionic diffusion (see pp. 784-785) of the uncharged fatty acid or by collision and
incorporation of the fatty acid into the cell membrane. However, it is clear that at least three integral membrane proteins promote the uptake of fatty acids (Fig. 45-13): fattyacid translocase (FAT or CD36), the plasma-membrane fatty acid-binding protein (FABPpm), and fatty-acid transport proteins (FATPs, members of the SLC27 family; see p. 967). Similarly, unesterified cholesterol and lysophospholipids must leave the micelle carrier to enter the enterocyte as monomers. Investigators have suggested that cholesterol derived from bile is better absorbed than dietary cholesterol. Most of the bile salts do not enter the enterocyte with the dietary lipids, but any that do are pumped back out into the lumen via ABCG5/ABCG8 transporters (see p. 957). The bile salts are absorbed via active transport by the apical, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent bile-acid transporter (ASBT) in the distal ileum (see pp. 962-963). As with fatty acids, 2-MAGs, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol traditionally were assumed to enter the enterocyte by simple diffusion across the apical plasma membrane of the brush-border villi. More recently, however, in addition to carriers for fatty acids, membrane proteins have been identified in both enterocytes and hepatocytes that may be responsible for the transfer of fatty acids, phospholipids, and cholesterol across their respective cell membranes. As well as providing a mechanism for facilitated or active absorption of the various products of lipid digestion, such carriers may yet be therapeutic targets for inhibiting lipid absorption. The drug ezetimibe, which lowers plasma cholesterol, impedes cholesterol uptake by inhibiting the internalization, at the enterocyte apical membrane, of a complex consisting of cholesterol and the Niemann-Pick C-1 like 1 (NPC1L1) protein.

## The enterocyte re-esterifies lipid components and assembles them into chylomicrons

The assimilation of fats, as described thus far, has been a process of disassembly of energy-dense, water-insoluble lipid macromolecular aggregates into monomers for intestinal absorption. The enterocyte elegantly reverses this process (Fig. 45-14). After absorbing LCFAs, MAGs, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol, the enterocyte re-esterifies them and assembles the products with specific apolipoproteins (or simply "apoproteins") into emulsion-like particles called chylomicrons. The enterocyte then exports the chylomicrons to the lymph (chyle) for ultimate delivery to other organs via the bloodstream. This process enables the delivery of dietary lipids to their intended target tissues (muscle and adipose tissue) while preventing the disruptive effects on cell membranes, were fatty acids to remain unesterified.

Chylomicrons are the largest of the five lipoprotein particles in the bloodstream. We discuss the other lipoprotein particles-very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), and high-density lipoproteins (HDLs)on pages 969-970 (see also Table 46-4). With an average diameter of $\sim 250 \mathrm{~nm}$ (range, 75 to 1200 nm ), chylomicrons consist primarily of TAGs, with smaller amounts of phospholipids, cholesteryl esters, cholesterol, and various apolipoproteins.

The first step in the enterocyte's re-formation of TAGs is the binding of LCFAs to a $14-\mathrm{kDa}$ cytosolic protein called

![bo694869338f](bo694869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-13 Micellar transport of lipid breakdown products to the surface of the enterocyte. Mixed micelles carry lipids through the acidic unstirred layer to the surface of the enterocyte. 2-MAG, fatty acids, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol leave the mixed micelle and enter an acidic microenvironment created by an apical Na-H exchanger. The acidity favors the protonation of the fatty acids. The lipids enter the enterocyte by (1) nonionic diffusion, (2) incorporation into the enterocyte membrane ("collision"), or (3) carrier-mediated transport.
the intestinal-type fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), or FABP2. The intestinal concentration of FABP2 is highest in regions that absorb fats, namely, the villi of the proximal jejunal enterocytes. FABP2 preferentially binds long-chain (rather than medium- or short-chain) fatty acids, thus minimizing both reflux back into the intestinal lumen and toxic damage to the enterocyte. FABP2 also ensures transfer of fatty acids to the enterocyte's smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) for re-esterification to form TAGs. After a meal, enterocytes mainly use the MAG pathway (1) N45-11 to re-esterify absorbed fatty acids to absorbed 2-MAG. During fasting, enterocytes mainly use the phosphatidic-acid pathway (2) N45-11 to esterify fatty acids that enter from the bloodstream and those derived from biliary phosphatidylcholine. The necessary phosphatidic acid may arise either from glycerol-3-phosphate-itself derived from the metabolism of glucose or amino acidsor from the breakdown of bile phosphatidylcholine that enters from the intestinal lumen. Both the MAG and the phosphatidic-acid pathways depend on the activation of the fatty acid to acyl coenzyme A (acyl CoA), catalyzed by long-chain acyl CoA synthetase. (3) N45-12 LCFAs are the preferred substrate for this enzyme. The net effect of this series of reactions is the very rapid formation of TAGs in the SER, which maintains low fatty-acid concentrations in the enterocyte. TAGs and fat droplets may be seen in
the cisternae of the SER on electron microscopy. The enterocyte also esterifies both cholesterol and lysophosphatidylcholine. 45 N45-13

Besides the lipids, the other components of the chylomicron are the various apolipoproteins (see Table 46-4), which the enterocyte synthesizes in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). These apolipoproteins, with the exception of apolipoprotein A-I, move to the lumen of the SER, where they associate with newly synthesized TAGs (see Fig. 45-14). Apolipoprotein A-I associates with chylomicrons in the Golgi apparatus. Besides incorporating apolipoproteins, the packaging of nascent chylomicrons involves adding esterified cholesterol and a surface coating of phosphatidylcholine and other phospholipids. It is thought that vesicles (the prechylomicron transport vesicle) derived from the SER carry nascent chylomicrons to the cis face of the Golgi apparatus, where they fuse and deliver their contents internally. Enzymes in the Golgi apparatus glycosylate the apolipoproteins. Vesicles carrying processed chylomicrons bud off from the trans face of the Golgi and move toward the basolateral plasma membrane of the enterocyte. This process is the rate-limiting step in the transit of dietary fat across the enterocyte. There the vesicles fuse with the basolateral membrane and leave the enterocyte.

The foregoing discussion focused on the digestion and absorption of long-chain TAGS. The handling of TAGS with

As summarized in eFig. 45-3, pancreatic lipase breaks down TAGs into fatty acids and 2-MAGs in the lumen of the small intestine. These products enter the enterocyte, which uses either
the MAG or the phosphatidic-acid pathways to re-esterify them. The resulting TAGs are packaged into chylomicrons, which enter the lymph and, ultimately, the blood.

## N45-13 Intestinal Esterification of Cholesterol and Synthesis of Phosphatidylcholine

## Contributed by Adrian Reuben

Esterification of cholesterol by enterocytes may involve several enzymes, such as cholesterol esterase and acyl CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase.

The enterocyte may produce phosphatidylcholine (i.e., lecithin) intracellularly by using lysolecithin acyltransferase to esterify absorbed lysolecithin or by de novo synthesis from phosphatidic acid.

![bo714869338f](bo714869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-14 Re-esterification of digested lipids by the enterocyte and the formation and secretion of chylomicrons. The enterocyte takes up SCFAs, MCFAs, and glycerol and passes them unchanged into the blood capillaries. The enterocyte also takes up LCFAs and 2-MAG and resynthesizes them into TAG in the SER. The enterocyte also processes cholesterol into cholesteryl esters and lysolecithin into lecithin (phosphatidylcholine). The fate of these substances, and the formation of chylomicrons, is illustrated by steps 1 to 7.

MCFAs is very different, inasmuch as (1) they are water soluble, and (2) the fatty-acid re-esterification enzymes prefer longer-chain fatty acids. Because of their water solubility, fatty acids and MAGs derived from medium-chain TAGS do not require either mixed micelles or bile salts for transport. Further, because the enterocyte does not re-esterify MCFAs, they move from the cell directly into the portal blood. As a result, medium-chain TAGS are suitable fat (caloric) substitutes for feeding patients with fat malabsorption.

## The enterocyte secretes chylomicrons into the lymphatics during feeding and secretes VLDLs during fasting

As we have described, vesicles carrying mature chylomicrons discharge their contents from the enterocyte into the lamina propria via exocytosis at the basolateral membrane. Chylomicrons are too large to pass through the fenestrae of blood capillaries, and thus they enter lymph through the larger interendothelial channels of the lymphatic capillaries. In both the fed and fasted states, the intestine also secretes into the lymph VLDLs, which are smaller ( 30 to 80 nm ) than chylomicrons. VLDLs have a protein and lipid composition similar to that of chylomicrons (see Table 46-4) but are synthesized independently and carry mainly endogenous (as opposed to dietary) lipids. The lymph lacteals originate in the tips of the villi and discharge their contents into the cisternae chyli. Lymph flows from the cisternae chyli to the thoracic duct, to enter the blood circulation via the left subclavian vein. The protein and lipid composition of both chylomicrons and VLDLs are modified during their passage through lymph and on entry into the blood.

The process of lipid digestion and absorption has great reserve capacity and many redundancies. For example, the mechanical disruption of food is accomplished in several ways by the mouth, stomach, and proximal intestine. Many of the digestive lipases have overlapping functions, and pancreatic lipase, in particular, is secreted in great excess. Much of the small intestine is not used for fat absorption in healthy individuals because most of the dietary lipid is absorbed within 60 cm from the pylorus. Nonetheless, fat malabsorption does occur in many disease states (Box 45-5). A logical classification for these disorders can be devised based on knowledge of the normal physiology. Thus, fat malabsorption may occur because of impairments in intraluminal digestion, intraluminal dispersion, mucosal penetration, chylomicron assembly, or transport from enterocyte

## BOX 45-5 Celiac Disease

Celiac disease (CD) is a not-uncommon disease that over the years has had a variety of names, including celiac sprue, gluten enteropathy, and nontropical sprue. CD was thought to affect primarily children with clinical manifestations of diarrhea and fat malabsorption, the latter leading to excess fecal fat (steatorrhea), and abnormal results on smallintestinal biopsy, all of which respond to a gluten-free diet. However, we now recognize that CD affects a much larger number of children and adults (perhaps nearly $1 \%$ of Americans), with a wide spectrum of symptoms or even no symptoms at all. These patients may have diarrhea, steatorrhea, growth retardation, bone disease, or anemia. Duodenal biopsy reveals atrophy of the epithelial villi (see p. 901)—often referred to as a flat biopsy-but with elongated crypts.

CD represents an autoimmune response to a peptide component of gluten called gliadin that is found in wheat, rye, and barley. The development of serological tests-including the detection in the serum of antibodies to tissue transglutaminase (anti-tTG)—has resulted in an increase in the number of individuals diagnosed with CD.

The abnormalities found on biopsy correlate with the symptoms. The absence of villous surface epithelial cells results in decreased nutrient absorption (often accompanied by steatorrhea). The elongation of crypts, which are responsible for electrogenic $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see pp. 907-908), accounts for the small-intestinal fluid secretion that occurs in untreated CD.

The need to maintain a gluten-free diet is lifelong. Considerable research focuses on the development both of enzymes that will detoxify gliadin peptides (in vivo or in vitro) and of drugs that will prevent these peptides from being absorbed by the small intestine. Success with either approach would permit patients with CD to consume gluten-containing products with impunity.
to the blood circulation. Within each major category are subdivisions. Frequently, the pathophysiology of these disorders is mixed (i.e., more than one step in the digestive or absorptive process is deranged), but nonetheless the defective components can be identified, and appropriate therapy given.

## DIGESTION AND ABSORPTION OF VITAMINS AND MINERALS

## Intestinal absorption of fat-soluble vitamins follows the pathways of lipid absorption and transport

Table 45-3 summarizes characteristics of the fat-soluble vitamins A (see pp. 367-368), D (see pp. 1063-1067), E, and K (see pp. 440-442). As a class, these vitamins rely on the lipidabsorption process discussed in the preceding subchapter. Although individual fat-soluble vitamins, once digested and absorbed, have somewhat specific fates according to their chemical nature, they have numerous overlapping physical properties that determine their similar handling in the intestinal lumen as well as uptake and processing by enterocytes. In contrast to their water-soluble counterparts (discussed below), fat-soluble vitamins do not form classical coenzyme structures or prosthetic groups with soluble apolipoproteins. Fat-soluble vitamins can also be stored in fat depots
in the body. Each of the fat-soluble vitamins is really a family of related compounds, some of which are esters.

After ingestion, fat-soluble vitamins are released from their association with proteins by the acidity of gastric juice or by proteolysis. In addition, carboxyl ester hydrolases (found in pancreatic juice and in the mucosal brush border) liberate free vitamins from their esters. In the proximal small intestine, fat-soluble vitamins incorporate with other lipid products into emulsion droplets, vesicles, and mixed micelles, which ferry them to the enterocyte surface for uptake. The absorption efficiency of fat-soluble vitamins varies from $50 \%$ to $80 \%$ for $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{D}$, and K to only $20 \%$ to $30 \%$ for vitamin E. Other ingestants-including dietary components and drugs and their carrier vehicles-can modify the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins. For example, high doses of vitamin A impair the absorption of vitamins E and K, whereas high doses of vitamin E enhance the absorption of vitamin A.

Enterocytes take up fat-soluble vitamins by simple diffusion or via transporters. After entry into the enterocyte, fat-soluble vitamins diffuse to the SER attached to carrier proteins-such as a cellular retinol-binding protein in the case of vitamin A, or retinol-or by other mechanisms. In the SER, the vitamins associate with lipid droplets that form nascent chylomicrons and VLDLs, which then translocate through the Golgi and secretory vesicles for exocytosis into lymph. During passage through the enterocyte, vitamin A and tiny amounts of vitamin D are esterified with LCFAs, but vitamin E and K are not.

Once in the systemic blood circulation, the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K enter the liver by receptor-mediated endocytosis of chylomicrons or remnant chylomicrons, as discussed on pages 966-968.

Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency occurs in various fatmalabsorption states, including those induced by malabsorptive bariatric surgery. (○) N45-14 drugs that impair TAG hydrolysis (e.g., orlistat), drugs that bind bile acids (e.g., cholestyramine), and reduction of bile acids by impaired hepatobiliary function or by unabsorbable dietary fat substitutes. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency can also result from impaired hepatic function. The consequences can include blindness and other irreversible eye disorders (deficiency of vitamin A); bone demineralization and resorption (deficiency of vitamin D); neurological, neuromuscular, and erythrocyte aberrations (deficiency of vitamin E); and both hemorrhagic and hypercoagulable states (disorders of vitamin K).

Treatment of fat-soluble vitamin deficiency includes administration of water-miscible emulsions of vitamins A and E, which can enter enterocytes without special handling in the intestinal lumen. These compounds then move into portal blood together with small amounts of the more polar forms of some of the vitamins, such as retinoic acid in the case of vitamin A and menadione in the case of vitamin K .

## Dietary folate (PteGlu7) must be deconjugated by a brush-border enzyme before absorption by an anion exchanger at the apical membrane

Folate is also referred to as folic acid, or pteroylmonoglutamate (PteGlu1). As we discuss below, the reduced form of folate-tetrahydrofolate (THF)-is a cofactor in biochemical reactions involving the transfer of 1-carbon fragments. The

# N45-14 Bariatric Surgery 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Bariatrics (from Greek baros [weight] + iater [physician]) is a branch of medicine that focuses on treating obesity. Bariatric surgery-or weight-loss surgery-includes a variety of procedures for treating morbid obesity but does not include procedures for removing body fat per se (e.g., liposuction).

Bariatric surgery is sometimes classified into three groups depending on whether the surgical procedure predominantly produces malabsorption, restriction (or reduction) of stomach size, or a mixed malabsorption/restriction. To the extent that the surgery results in malabsorption of fats, a consequence can be a deficiency of the fat-soluble vitamins. In patients who have undergone such surgery, vitamin D deficiency is common.

In addition, bariatric surgery patients are also commonly deficient in several water-soluble vitamins (e.g., cobalamin, thiamine,
folate) and minerals (e.g., iron, zinc, magnesium). In the case of cobalamin or vitamin $B_{12}$, the stomach contributes the IF that binds the cobalamin (see Fig. 45-16). Vitamin $B_{12}$ must be given parenterally to avoid pernicious anemia (see (5) N45-6).

recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for folate is $200 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ for men and $180 \mu \mathrm{~g}$ for women (see Table 45-3), but it is more than doubled in pregnant women (see p. 1143). THF is essential for the synthesis of thymine and purines, which are critical components of DNA. Thus, folate deficiency compromises DNA synthesis and cell division, an effect that is most clinically noticeable in the bone marrow, where the turnover of cells is rapid. Because RNA and protein synthesis are not impaired, large red blood cells called megaloblasts are produced. The resultant megaloblastic anemia can become quite severe if untreated. Megaloblastic cells also may be seen in other organs with rapid cell turnover, such as the small intestine. Folic acid supplementation during pregnancy also reduces the risk of neural tube defects.

The medicinal form of folate is PteGlu1, a monoglutamate. Fig. 45-15A shows the structure of PteGlu1 and also illustrates how folate can act as a methyl acceptor or donor in the interconversion of serine to glycine. Dietary folate exists in several forms, much of it as folate polyglutamate, or PteGlu7 (see Fig. 45-15B), which is widely available in the diet, particularly in spinach, beans, and liver. The intestinal absorption of PteGlu7 requires deconjugation by a brush-
border peptidase to PteGlu1, which then enters the enterocyte via a transporter (see Fig. 45-15C). This deconjugation is catalyzed by folate conjugase, a zinc-activated exopeptidase present in the brush border. This enzyme removes glutamate residues from PteGlu7 in a stepwise fashion before absorption of PteGlu1. This stepwise hydrolysis of the polyglutamate chain of PteGlu7 is the rate-limiting step in folate digestion-absorption. Both folate deconjugation and folate absorption occur only in the proximal small intestine and are maximally active at a pH of 5 .

PteGlu1 absorption is saturable, shows substrate specificity, and is markedly enhanced at an acid pH . Folate absorption represents an apical membrane anion-exchange process in which folate uptake is linked to the efflux of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$across the apical membrane (i.e., folate-OH exchange). The mechanism of folate movement out of the epithelial cell across the basolateral membrane is not understood.

The PteGlu1 taken up by the enterocyte is not biologically active. The enzyme difolate reductase acts on PteGlu1 to form first dihydrofolate (DHF) and then the biologically active derivative THF. The cell then converts THF to 5,10-methylene-THF (see Fig. 45-15D), the form of folate needed

Figure 45-15 Folate deconjugation and absorption. A, THF has three parts: the biologically active pteridine moiety, a p-aminobenzoate, and a glutamate. PteGlu1 is the oxidized form of folate and is biologically inactive. B, Dietary folate is similar to medicinal folate but has several glutamate residues. PteGlu7 is also oxidized and inactive. C, In the proximal small intestine, a brush-border peptidase sequentially removes all but the last of the glutamate residues from dietary folate. The enterocyte then absorbs the resulting PteGlu1 using a folate-OH exchanger. Once inside the enterocyte, the PteGlu1 exists across the basolateral membrane via an unknown transporter. The enterocyte may reduce some of the PteGlu1 to DHF and then to THF, the biologically active form of folate. The enterocyte may then methylate some of the THF to form $\mathrm{N}^{6}$-methyl-THF, as summarized in D. D, After the cell has reduced PteGlu1 to THF by adding the four highlighted hydrogens, it first converts THF to 5,10-methylene-THF, breaking down serine to glycine in the process. This 5,10-methylene-THF is the methyl donor in the conversion of the nucleotide dUMP to dTMP in the synthesis of DNA. A second reaction converts this 5,10-methylene-THF to $\mathrm{N}^{6}$-methyl-THF, which can then act as a methyl donor in the synthesis of methionine (see Fig. 45-16B).

The cell also can transform this 5,10-methylene-THF to $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyl-THF, which-as we discuss in the next section-can act as a methyl donor in the synthesis of methionine. The circulating, storage, and active forms of folate constitute various reduced (DHF and THF) and methylated derivatives of folate. The liver is the primary site at which dietary pteroylglutamates are reduced and methylated, although the intestinal epithelium may make a small contribution to these reactions.

## Vitamin $B_{12}$ (cobalamin) binds to haptocarrin in the stomach and then to intrinsic factor in the small intestine before endocytosis by enterocytes in the ileum

Cobalamin, or vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ (Fig. 45-16A), is synthesized only by microorganisms, not by mammalian cells. The primary source of cobalamin in humans is the ingestion of animal products-meat, fish, shellfish, eggs, and (to a limited

# N45-15 NADH/NAD+ versus NADPH/NADP+ 

## Contributed by Alisha Bouzaher

NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$are, respectively, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and their close analogs are NADPH and NADP ${ }^{+}$, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The coenzymes NADH and NADPH each consist of two nucleotides joined at their phosphate groups by a phosphoanhydride bond. NADPH is structurally distinguishable from NADH by the additional phosphate group residing on the ribose ring of the nucleotide, which allows enzymes to preferentially interact with either molecule.

Total concentrations of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}\left(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\right)$ are higher in the cell by $\sim 10$-fold compared to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}\left(10^{-6} \mathrm{M}\right)$. Ratios of the oxidized and reduced forms of these coenzymes offer perspective into the metabolic activity of the cell. The high NAD ${ }^{+}$/ NADH ratio favors the transfer of a hydride from a substrate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH, the reduced form of the molecule and
oxidizing agent. Therefore, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is highly prevalent within catabolic reaction pathways where reducing equivalents (carbohydrate, fats, and proteins) transfer protons and electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. NADH acts as an energy carrier, transferring electrons from one reaction to another. Conversely, the NADP $+ / \mathrm{NADPH}$ ratio is low, favoring the transfer of a hydride to a substrate oxidizing NADPH to NADP ${ }^{+}$. Thus, NADPH is utilized as a reducing agent within anabolic reactions, particularly the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

Figure 45-16 Cobalamin and the role of intrinsic factor (IF) in the absorption of cobalamin. A, Cyanocobalamin. B, Methylation cycle. Cobalamin is the coenzyme for the enzyme homocysteine:methionine methyltransferase, which transfers a methyl group from $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyltetrahydrofolate to homocysteine, thereby forming methionine and THF. C, Steps 1 to 8 show the fate of dietary cobalamin (CBL). Steps 4 to 8 show the role of IF. In addition, bile carries cobalamin into the duodenum. D, The IF/cobalamin complex is thought to be endocytosed. The cobalamin is liberated within the enterocyte by mechanisms that have not been established. Within the enterocyte, cobalamin binds to transcobalamin II (TCII), which is required for cobalamin's exit from the enterocyte.
extent) milk. Cobalamin is not present in vegetables or fruit. Therefore, strict vegetarians are at risk of developing dietary cobalamin deficiency.

Cobalamin's primary function is to serve as a coenzyme for homocysteine:methionine methyltransferase (see Fig. 45-16B), which transfers a methyl group from methyltetrafolate to homocysteine, thereby converting homocysteine to methionine. Methionine is an essential amino acid and in an altered form serves as an important donor of methyl groups in several important enzymatic reactions. If cobalamin is deficient and methionine levels fall, then the body converts its stores of intracellular folate (e.g., PteGlu1, THF, 5,10-methylene-THF) into $\mathrm{N}^{5}$-methyl-THF (see Fig. 45-15D) in an effort to produce more methionine. As a result, levels of 5,10-methylene-THF (the form of folate needed for DNA synthesis) falls, an effect that explains why folate and cobalamin deficiencies cause identical hematological abnormalities (i.e., megaloblastic anemia). In addition, cobalamin deficiency causes various neurological and psychological abnormalities that are not part of the syndrome of folate deficiency. Some of these abnormalities may be linked to deficient activity of methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, another cobalamin-dependent coenzyme.

Cobalamin reaches the stomach bound to proteins in ingested food. In the stomach, pepsin and the low gastric pH release the cobalamin from the ingested proteins (see Fig. 45-16C). The now-free cobalamin binds to haptocorrin (formerly known as R-type binder), a glycoprotein secreted by the salivary and gastric glands. The parietal cells of the stomach secrete a second protein, intrinsic factor (IF), crucial for the absorption of cobalamin. However, cobalamin and IF do not interact in the acidic milieu of the stomach. Rather, gastric acidity enhances the binding of cobalamin to haptocorrin. When this cobalamin-haptocorrin complex reaches the duodenum, the haptocorrin is degraded by pancreatic proteases (see Fig. 45-16C).

After the release of cobalamin from the cobalaminhaptocorrin complex in the proximal small intestine-made alkaline by the secretion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from the pancreas and duodenum-both dietary cobalamin and cobalamin derived from bile bind to IF. The cobalamin-IF complex is highly resistant to enzyme degradation. As noted above, the gastric parietal cells secrete IF, a $45-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycoprotein. Acetylcholine, gastrin, and histamine stimulate gastric acid secretion (see p. 866), and they also stimulate IF secretion. IF secretion parallels proton secretion, but with three important differences. First, as in pepsinogen secretion, histamine triggers an IF release that peaks within minutes and then continues at a reduced rate. This secretory pattern is related to the secretion of preformed IF; histamine has no effect on IF
synthesis. Second, although cAMP is important in IF secretion, a role for intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ has not yet been established. Third, $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ histamine-receptor antagonists block IF secretion, but omeprazole, an inhibitor of the parietal-cell H-K pump, does not affect IF secretion.

The next step in the absorption of cobalamin is the binding of the cobalamin-IF complex to specific receptors on the apical membranes of enterocytes in the ileum. Cobalamin without IF neither binds to ileal receptors nor is absorbed. The binding of the cobalamin-IF complex is selective and rapid and requires $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, but it is not energy dependent. The enterocyte next internalizes the cobalamin-IF complex in a process that is energy dependent but has not been well characterized. Inside the cell, cobalamin and IF dissociate; lysosomal degradation may play a role here. Within the enterocyte, cobalamin binds to another transport protein-transcobalamin II-which is required for cobalamin's exit from the enterocyte. The cobalamin exits the ileal enterocyte across the basolateral membrane bound to transcobalamin II, possibly by an exocytotic mechanism. The transcobalamin II-cobalamin complex enters the portal circulation, where it is delivered to the liver for storage and for secretion into the bile.

Total-body cobalamin stores are large ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{mg}$ ), particularly when compared with the daily rate of cobalamin absorption and loss. (The daily cobalamin requirement for normal adults is only 2 micrograms.) The load of cobalamin presented to the small intestine is derived about equally from two sources: the diet and biliary secretions. The latter is the result of the enterohepatic circulation (see pp. 962-964) of cobalamin; after its absorption, cobalamin is delivered throughout the body, and the excess is secreted by the liver into the bile, where it once again can be reabsorbed by the small intestine and recirculated.

Cobalamin deficiency has many possible causes. As already mentioned, a strict vegetarian diet is deficient in cobalamin. In pernicious anemia, a disorder seen primarily in the elderly, the absence of gastric parietal cells results in the absence of gastric acid and IF secretion. Consequently, cobalamin absorption is markedly reduced, and cobalamin deficiency develops. Other causes of cobalamin deficiency include related problems in the intestine. Bacterial overgrowth in the small intestine as a result of stasis (e.g., multiple jejunal diverticulosis) can be associated with cobalamin deficiency as a consequence of bacterial binding and metabolism of cobalamin. Crohn disease affecting the ileum and ileal resection are other possible causes of cobalamin malabsorption and deficiency as a result of an absence of ileal receptors for the cobalamin-IF complex.

Figure 45-17 Active $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake in the duodenum. The small intestine absorbs $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by two mechanisms. The passive paracellular absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ occurs throughout the small intestine. This pathway is the predominant one but is not under the control of vitamin D. The second mechanism-the active transcellular absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-occurs only in the duodenum. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ enters the cell across the apical membrane via a channel. Inside the cell, the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is buffered by binding proteins such as calbindin and is also taken up into intracellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum. The enterocyte then extrudes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the basolateral membrane via a Ca pump and an Na-Ca exchanger. Thus, the net effect is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption. The active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) stimulates all three steps of transcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption. NCX1, Na-Ca exchanger 1.

## $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption, regulated primarily by vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ occurs by active transport in the duodenum and by diffusion throughout the small intestine

The physiological importance and complex regulation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and vitamin D are discussed in Chapter 52. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ load presented to the small intestine is derived from dietary sources and digestive secretions. Most of the dietary $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ $(\sim 1000 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) comes from milk and milk products (see Fig. 52-1). Not all of the ingested $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is bioavailable. For example, only very little of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ present in leafy vegetables is absorbed because of the concomitant presence of oxalate, a salt that binds $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and reduces its availability for absorption. The small intestine absorbs $\sim 500 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, but also secretes $\sim 325 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Thus, the net uptake is $\sim 175 \mathrm{mg} /$ day.

Active transcellular uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ occurs only in the epithelial cells of the duodenum, but $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is absorbed by passive paracellular diffusion throughout the small intestine. More $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is absorbed in the jejunum and ileum by diffusion than in the duodenum by active transport; this difference arises largely because the duodenum has a smaller total surface area and because the flow of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-containing fluid through the duodenum is faster.

The active transport of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the villous epithelial cells of the duodenum is transcellular and is under the control of vitamin D—primarily via genomic effects (see
pp. 71-72). Transcellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption involves three steps (Fig. 45-17). The uptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ across the apical membrane occurs via TRPV6 $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (see Table 6-2, family No. 5), driven by the electrochemical gradient between the lumen and the cell. Cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ then binds to a protein called calbindin, which buffers intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. This step is important because it allows levels of unbound (i.e., free) intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to remain rather low despite large transcellular fluxes of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. A Ca pump and an Na-Ca exchanger on the basolateral membrane then extrude the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cell into the interstitial fluid. The active form of vitamin D-1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D-stimulates all three steps of the transcellular pathway, but its most important effect is to enhance the second step by increasing the synthesis of calbindin.

The passive absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ throughout the small intestine occurs via the paracellular pathway, which is not under the control of vitamin $\mathrm{D} . \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption is also enhanced by low plasma $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ and during pregnancy and lactation. Absorption tends to diminish with aging.

Vitamin D itself is a fat-soluble vitamin that is absorbed mainly in the jejunum. Of course, the skin synthesizes vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ from cholesterol in a process that requires ultraviolet light (see p. 1064). Thus, dietary vitamin D (both vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ ) is most important in regions of the world that do not receive much sunlight and during long, dark winters.

## $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption occurs by an active process in the ileum

$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is an important intracellular ion that is required as an enzyme cofactor-many enzymes using ATP actually require that the ATP be complexed with $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$-and is critical for neurotransmission and muscular contractions. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ deficiency can affect neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal function. $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is also important for the proper secretion of, and end-organ response to, parathyroid hormone. Thus, $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ depletion is typically associated with hypocalcemia.
$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ is widely available in different foods but is present in particularly large amounts in green vegetables, cereals, and meats. The RDA for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ in young adults is $\sim 350 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for men and $\sim 280 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for women (Table 45-4). The $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ load to the small intestine is derived from both dietary sources and digestive secretions.
$\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption by the gastrointestinal tract is not yet well understood, but it appears to differ substantially from the absorption of the other key divalent cation, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, in three important respects. First, an active transport process for $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption appears to exist in the ileum, rather than in the duodenum, as is the case for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Second, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D does not consistently increase $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption. Third, patients with increased intestinal $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ absorption (e.g., absorptive hypercalciuria) have normal $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption. Along with active $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ absorption in the ileum, passive absorption of $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$ occurs in the rest of the small intestine.

## Heme and nonheme iron are absorbed in the duodenum by distinct cellular mechanisms

Iron plays several critical roles in human physiology, both in the heme groups of the cytochromes and as a key component of the oxygen-carrying heme moieties of hemoglobin and myoglobin. The most important complication of iron
depletion is anemia. Iron overload produces hemochromatosis, a not-uncommon genetic disease (Box 45-6).

Dietary iron takes two major forms: iron that is part of a heme moiety and iron that is not. These two types of dietary iron are absorbed by distinctly different mechanisms (Fig. 45-18). Overall iron absorption is low; $10 \%$ to $20 \%$ of ingested iron is absorbed. Heme iron is absorbed more efficiently than nonheme iron. Body stores of iron depend almost exclusively on iron absorption because no regulated pathway for iron excretion exists. Except in menstruating women, who require $\sim 50 \%$ more iron in their diets, very little iron is lost from the body. Dietary iron comes primarily from meat-especially liver and fish-as well as vegetables. The RDA for iron in young adults is $\sim 10 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for men and $\sim 15 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for women (see Table 45-4).

Nonheme Iron Nonheme iron may be either ferric $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right)$ or ferrous $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}\right)$. Ferric iron tends to form salt complexes with anions quite easily and thus is not readily absorbed; it is not soluble at pH values $>3$. Ferrous iron does not complex easily and is soluble at pH values as high as 8 . Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) forms soluble complexes with iron and reduces iron from the ferric to the ferrous state, thereby enhancing iron absorption. Tannins, present in tea, form insoluble complexes with iron and lower its absorption.

Iron movement does not occur passively but requires one or more proteins for facilitation of movement into and out of cells (especially enterocytes, hepatocytes, and macrophages) as well as for intracellular binding. The absorption of nonheme iron is restricted to the duodenum. The enterocyte takes up nonheme iron across the apical membrane via the divalent metal cotransporter DMT1 (SLC11A2), which cotransports $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$into the cell (see p. 123). DMT1, as well as the oligopeptide cotransporter that we discussed above, is unusual in being energized by the inwardly directed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient. DMT1 also efficiently absorbs a host of other divalent metals, including several that are highly toxic (e.g., $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}, \mathrm{Pb}^{2+}$ ). In the case of dietary ferric iron, the ferric

# BOX 45-6 Hemochromatosis 

H ereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is a relatively common inherited disorder (3 to 5 persons in 1000 of northwestern European ancestry are homozygous) in which the body absorbs excessive iron from the diet. This autosomal recessive disease becomes clinically significant only in homozygotes. If left untreated, HH can be fatal. The excess iron is stored in the liver, where it reaches toxic concentrations. Cirrhosis eventually results, greatly increasing the risk of hepatoma. Iron also ultimately accumulates in other organ systems, causing pancreatic damage (diabetes mellitus), bronze pigmentation of the skin, pituitary and gonadal failure, arthritis, and cardiomyopathy. The disease hardly ever becomes apparent before the individual enters the third decade of life. Women are relatively protected as long they are premenopausal, because their monthly menstrual flow keeps total-body iron stores at relatively normal levels.

The diagnosis can be made by detection of elevated iron and transferrin-saturation levels and elevated ferritin level. A liver biopsy is confirmatory.

Treatment, reminiscent of the medieval approach to disease, is to remove (by phlebotomy) one or even several units of blood ( 1 unit $=500 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) from the patient on a regular basis until the iron overload is corrected, as evidenced by normal plasma ferritin levels. Afterward, most patients require phlebotomy only once every few months to maintain low iron stores.

The HFE gene that is associated with HH is related to the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I family. More than $80 \%$ of patients with HH are homozygous for a missense mutation (C282Y) in HFE. However, the role of this mutated gene in hemochromatosis is not yet clear because the penetrance of hemochromatosis in individuals with the C282Y allele is very low ( $<5 \%$ ).

Attention has focused on hepcidin, a hepatic peptide hormone that is the primary regulator of body iron stores. In response to elevated iron stores, Kupffer cells increase their production of hepcidin; the hepcidin binds to basolateral FPN1 in duodenal enterocytes, which leads to FPN1 internalization, ubiquitination, and degradation. The result is a decrease in $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ absorption (see Fig. 45-18). Hemochromatosis may represent a defect in the regulation of hepcidin. It is possible that a mutated HFE gene causes an inappropriately low hepatic hepcidin expression, thus resulting in hemochromatosis.

The relationship between hepcidin and iron absorption has also been identified in the anemia of inflammation, caused by a reduction in duodenal iron absorption. In this setting, the cytokine interleukin-6 stimulates hepcidin expression and thus decreased iron absorption.
![bo804869338f](bo804869338f.jpg)

Figure 45-18 Absorption of nonheme and heme iron in the duodenum. The absorption of nonheme iron occurs almost exclusively in the form of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, which crosses the duodenal apical membrane via DMT1, driven by a $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient that is maintained by $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange. Heme enters the enterocyte by an unknown mechanism. Inside the cell, heme oxygenase releases $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, which is then reduced to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. Cytoplasmic $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ then binds to mobilferrin for transit across the cell to the basolateral membrane. $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ probably exits the enterocyte via basolateral ferroportin. The ferroxidase activity of hephaestin converts $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ for carriage in the blood plasma bound to transferrin.

reductase Dcytb (duodenal cytochrome b) presumably reduces $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ at the extracellular surface of the apical membrane before uptake via DMT1.
$\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ moves into the cytoplasm of the enterocyte, where it binds to mobilferrin, an intracellular protein that ferries the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to the basolateral membrane. The enterocyte then translocates the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ across the basolateral membrane, possibly via ferroportin transporter 1 (FPN1, SLC40A1). The mRNA encoding FPN1 has an iron response element (see p. 99) in its $5^{\prime}$ untranslated region; thus, an increase in intracellular iron levels would be expected to decrease FPN1 synthesis. Following the exit of $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ from the enterocyte via FPN1, the ferroxidase hephaestin-a homolog of the plasma protein ceruloplasmin, which carries copper (see p. 970)-apparently oxidizes the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, which then binds to plasma transferrin (see p. 42) for carriage in the blood.

Once in the circulation, nonheme iron bound to transferrin is ultimately deposited in all the tissues of the body, but it has a particular predilection for the liver and reticuloendothelial system. Inside these cells, it binds to the protein apoferritin to form ferritin (see p. 971), the major storage form of iron. Smaller amounts of storage iron exist in an insoluble form called hemosiderin.

Heme Iron Derived from myoglobin and hemoglobin, heme iron is also absorbed by duodenal epithelial cells. Heme iron enters the cells either by binding to a brushborder protein or through an endocytotic mechanism. Inside the cell, heme oxygenase enzymatically splits the heme iron, thus releasing free $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}, \mathrm{CO}$, and biliverdin (see Fig. 46-6A). The cell reduces the biliverdin to bilirubin, which the liver eventually excretes in bile (see Box 46-1). The enterocyte then handles the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in the same manner as nonheme iron.

Iron absorption is tightly regulated by the size of existing body iron stores. In physiologically normal subjects, iron absorption is limited but is markedly increased in states of iron deficiency, caused most often by gastrointestinal bleeding or excessive menstrual flow. For example, the expression of DMT1 and FPN1 increases in iron deficiency. Conversely, an increase in iron stores modestly reduces iron absorption.

The molecular mechanisms by which iron stores regulate iron absorption play a role in the pathophysiology of hemochromatosis (see Box 45-6). Hepcidin, a 25 -amino-acid peptide secreted by hepatocytes, reduces duodenal iron absorption by downregulating the iron exporter ferroportin (FPN1). Hepcidin is a negative regulator of iron absorption. Indeed, mice that fail to express hepcidin have elevated body iron stores, whereas mice with enhanced hepcidin expression have profound iron deficiency.

## NUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS

## No absolute daily requirement for carbohydrate or fat intake exists

Nutritionists recommend that the daily intake of carbohydrate relative to fat should not differ with age, gender, or activity level. Of the total caloric intake in a Western diet,
$55 \%$ to $60 \%$ is typically carbohydrate, $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ is fat, and the remaining $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ is protein.

The requirements for total caloric intake vary among individuals and depend on certain factors, including a person's ability to use and store energy (efficiency) and the daily activity level. Differences in the efficiency of energy use among individuals are the result, in part, of variations in muscle mass but also of genetic factors. Because adipose tissue has a low metabolic rate, people with a large fat mass require less caloric intake per kilogram of body weight. Stated differently, the requirement for energy intake is greater per kilogram of lean body mass than per kilogram of total body mass (which includes fat). Thus, men generally require a greater daily caloric intake per kilogram of body weight than do women, who have relatively less muscle and more fat.

Activity level is the primary factor determining the daily energy requirement, assuming a stable body weight. For example, in a steady state, athletes must consume more than nonathletes not only because of a higher muscle-to-fat ratio but also because of a higher energy expenditure. Manual labor necessitates greater energy intake than does sedentary activity, again to maintain energy balance and body weight. Excess energy intake over output, over time, causes weight gain in the form of fat (see p. 1173). Using $9.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ as the conversion factor, 1 kg of fat stores 9400 kcal , sufficient energy to support the basal metabolic rate for 4 days.

In addition to serving as a source of energy, fatty acids are also important for membrane structure (see p. 8-9) as well as signal transduction by pathways such as those involving DAGs (see p. 60-61) and arachidonic acid (see p. 62). In mammalian cells, fatty-acid synthase produces two major fatty acids: palmitic acid and oleic acid. Palmitic acid, which has 16 carbons and is fully saturated, is referred to as $16: 0$. Oleic acid has 18 carbons and a single cis double bond between carbons 9 and 10. This unsaturated fatty acid is referred to as $18: 1 \mathrm{cis}-\Delta^{9}$. Because mammals cannot insert double bonds beyond carbon 9 , they need two fatty acids in the diet: linoleate ( $18: 2$ cis- $\Delta^{9} \Delta^{12}$ ) and linolenate ( $18: 3$ cis$\left.\Delta^{9} \Delta^{12} \Delta^{15}\right)$. These essential fatty acids serve as precursors for other unsaturated fatty acids, including arachidonic acid, which is a precursor to prostaglandins, leukotrienes, and thromboxanes.

The current recommendations favoring low fat intake are based on the view that a high fat intake is associated with chronic diseases such as atherosclerosis and non-insulindependent diabetes (see Box 51-5). However, fats have a positive side. In addition to playing the roles we have discussed in this chapter, fats enhance satiety and aid in the absorption of certain vitamins (see p. 933). Finally, the so-called omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids-in which the first double bond is three carbons from the terminal methyl group (or "omega carbon")-appear to protect against cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer.

## The daily protein requirement for adult humans is typically $0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight but is higher in pregnant women, postsurgical patients, and athletes

The diet must contain the nine essential amino acids (see Table 58-2) because the body cannot synthesize them. Eleven other amino acids are necessary for protein synthesis, but

the body can synthesize their carbon skeletons from intermediates of carbohydrate metabolism. Vegetarian diets can meet the protein needs of the body provided the protein consumed contains adequate amounts of essential amino acids. Food protein is "scored" based on its content of essential amino acids compared with that of a reference protein, usually egg protein, which is given a score of 100 . For example, a food containing protein with a score of 40 for threonine, 80 for phenylalanine, and 100 for lysine-all three of which are essential amino acids-receives a protein score of 40 because, relative to the standard, threonine is present in the lowest amount.

Protein intake is most important to meet the needs for tissue maintenance and repair, for muscle and neural function, and for maintenance of host defense mechanisms. The daily requirement for protein intake depends on one's nutritional status. The average human needs $\sim 0.6 \mathrm{~g}$ of protein per kilogram of body weight per day to maintain nitrogen balance. The RDA for protein is $\sim 0.8 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight for adults, $\sim 1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ for adolescents, and $\sim 2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ in the first 6 months of life. Pregnant and lactating women require extra protein intake to ensure adequate fetal development and milk production. Athletes require $>1 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{kg}$ to maintain a greater lean body mass and to fuel a highly active metabolism. Well-balanced but larger meals usually provide adequate protein for those with a greater need. Burn victims, patients recovering from surgery, and patients with disorders of protein absorption all require increased daily protein intake.

The distribution of amino acids required for protein accretion by growing infants and children is different from that for tissue maintenance. Moreover, the requirements change throughout development. The child uses $25 \%$ of amino-acid intake for protein accretion at 6 months of age but only $10 \%$ by 18 months of age. More than $40 \%$ of a child's protein intake must consist of essential amino acids versus only $20 \%$ of an adult's.

Proteins play a key role in host defenses. For example, proteins provide the structural backbone for skin and mucus. Protein synthesis is essential for phagocytes and lymphocytes that are responsible for antibody and cell-mediated immunity. The skin, lungs, and intestinal tract are the main structural defenses against invading organisms. In both the lungs and the gastrointestinal tract, mucus (containing glycoproteins) coats the surface of the passageways and aids in defending against disease by catching most foreign particles. Protein-depleted individuals, regardless of age, have impaired immune competence. Protein depletion limits the availability of amino acids for synthesis of the cellular proteins of the immune system, including glutathione, mucus glycoproteins, and metallothreonine. The acute-phase response to invading organisms is suboptimal in a protein-deficient state.

The impaired immune competence of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a function of poor nutrition in addition to the effects of the virus itself. During infection, the body mobilizes amino acids to synthesize proteins for defense against invading organisms. Thus, improving protein and energy intake may be beneficial for some AIDS patients.

Aside from being the backbone of proteins, amino acids play a variety of physiological roles. For example, arginine is
a precursor to nitric oxide (see p. 66). Glutamate is a major excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain (see pp. 318-319), whereas glycine is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter (see p. 319). Glutamine is a major source of $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ production in the kidney (see pp. 829-831) and it also regulates protein turnover in muscle. The decrease in muscle glutamine concentration that occurs during trauma and infection is associated with a general decline of muscle function. Research in anorectic patients shows that the most important factor affecting muscle function is insufficient nutrient intake. Increasing total nutrient intake in these patients by total parenteral nutrition increases muscle function before it has a measurable effect on muscle mass.

## Minerals and vitamins are not energy sources but are necessary for certain enzymatic reactions, for protein complexes, or as precursors for biomolecules

Vitamins and minerals do not provide energy but are essential for such functions as metabolism, immune competence, muscle-force production, and blood clotting.

Minerals Table 45-4 lists the essential minerals. The current recommendations for daily mineral intake are based on a mix of balance studies and usual dietary intakes in the United States. The recommendation for copper, for example, is based on balance studies, whereas those for manganese, chromium, and molybdenum are based on dietary intakes.

Assigning daily mineral intakes is problematic because some methods of determining mineral status do not always expose functional deficiencies. For example, a frank deficiency in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake leads to bone loss even though blood $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ levels remain normal. Iron deficiency is difficult to detect because no clinical signs appear until iron stores are depleted. It is difficult to base recommendations simply on absorption because, for some minerals, absorption varies with intake. For example, copper deficiency or toxicity is unlikely in humans because absorption is inversely related to intake. Furthermore, interactions among minerals must be taken into account when establishing recommendations.

The goal is to base recommendations on scientific evidence. Radioisotopes can be used to monitor storage, absorption, and excretion. Another approach is to establish the physiological role of the mineral and then determine the mineral intake required for maintaining that physiological role. However, because of redundancy in function, it is often difficult to assess which mineral is deficient when function is compromised. For example, both iron and copper are involved in energy metabolism at the level of the electron transport chain. The blood clotting cascade involves $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, copper, and vitamin K. Zinc, selenium, and manganese all have antioxidant activities.

Vitamins Even though vitamins are not energy sources themselves, they play an integral role as cofactors in many metabolic processes. Some vitamins are involved in group-transfer reactions, such as decarboxylations and carboxylations in fatty-acid and glucose metabolism, and transaminations in amino-acid metabolism. Vitamins act as

oxidizing and reducing agents in the generation of ATP and also as antioxidants to quench free radicals produced as a byproduct of oxidation.

Of the 13 identified vitamins, RDAs have been established for 11 (see Table 45-3). Safe and allowable ranges are estimated for the remaining two-biotin and pantothenic acid. Recommendations differ widely among countries. Lower recommendations are generally based on scientific evidence. For each vitamin, a person's nutritional status falls into one of five categories: deficient, marginal, satisfactory, excessive, and toxic. Although "marginal" and "excessive" are not usually associated with overt clinical signs, people whose vitamin status falls into one of these categories are at increased risk of various diseases.

In the past, recommendations for the intake of vitamins and minerals were based largely on levels necessary to promote normal growth and development. However, the role of vitamins and minerals in optimizing body function and in promoting longevity is becoming an area of intense interest both to researchers and to the general public. Older people generally have a less vigorous immune response than do young people, in large part because of deficiencies in iron, zinc, and vitamin C. Correcting these deficiencies improves immune competence significantly. In addition, older people with poor dietary habits may have inadequate intake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, vitamin D, and other nutrients involved in bone deposition and strength (see pp. 1056-1058), which puts them at greater risk of hip fracture.

Mineral deficiencies usually do not occur without extreme abnormalities in diet, and even then, a mineral deficiency may not impair function (see Table 45-4). However, a deficiency of almost any vitamin can cause functional impairment (see Table 45-3).

## Excessive intake of vitamins and minerals has mixed effects on bodily function

A current controversy surrounds the use of so-called megadoses of certain vitamins and minerals. Such excessive intake
has mixed effects. Slight excesses of vitamins A and E, zinc, and selenium are associated with an enhanced immune response, especially in patients with burns, trauma, or sepsis. In these conditions, "excess" intake may not be an excess at all but rather the intake that meets the greater need. Increased intake of fruits and vegetables-which contain a variety of vitamins as well as "fiber"-clearly decreases the risk of various cancers. However, efforts to link these effects specifically to dietary carotenoid levels have failed to show a correlation; indeed, the excessive intake of $\beta$-carotene supplements may even increase the risk of some cancers. Antioxidants (e.g., $\beta$-carotene, vitamins C and E) quench peroxyl radicals of lipids, suppress tumor growth, and decrease atherosclerotic lesions in rabbits. Enhanced vitamin E intake lowers the risk of coronary heart disease by nearly one half.

The excessive intake of certain minerals and vitamins may compromise the immune response. Excess vitamin E intake in infants may increase the risk of infection, possibly by quenching superoxide radicals that are important for leukocytes to kill bacteria. Excess lipids can impair the immune response, too. High intake of saturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids leads to decreases in cell-mediated immunity. Excessive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ intake interferes with the ability to use iron, zinc, and $\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, whereas high dietary copper affects zinc absorption and excretion.

Because the kidneys readily excrete water-soluble vitamins in the urine, toxicity from excessive intake is not common. Because fat-soluble vitamins are not easily excreted in the urine, it is easier to develop toxicity for these vitamins. In particular, polar bear liver, a component of the Inuit diet, contains extraordinarily high levels of vitamin A (35,000 IU/g versus the RDA of 5000 IU ), which can lead to acute hypervitaminosis A and death.

# HEPATOBILIARY FUNCTION 

Frederick J. Suchy

## OVERVIEW OF LIVER PHYSIOLOGY

After the skin, the liver and the brain are the largest organs in the human body. The liver weighs between 1200 and 1500 g , representing $2 \%$ to $5 \%$ of body weight in the adult and $\sim 4 \%$ to $5 \%$ in the newborn. The liver is strategically situated in the circulatory system to receive the portal blood that drains the stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, and spleen (see Fig. 24-7A). In this position, the liver plays a key role in handling foodstuffs assimilated by the small intestine. However, the liver's role is far more diverse; it serves as a chemical factory, an excretory system, an exocrine gland, and an endocrine gland.

## The liver biotransforms and degrades substances taken up from blood and either returns them to the circulation or excretes them into bile

A major function of the liver is to metabolize, detoxify, and inactivate both endogenous compounds (e.g., steroids and other hormones) and exogenous substances (e.g., drugs and toxins). In addition, by virtue of its large vascular capacity and abundance of phagocytes (Kupffer cells), the liver provides an important filtering mechanism for the circulation by removing foreign particulate matter, including bacteria, endotoxins, parasites, and aging red blood cells. Kupffer cells constitute $80 \%$ to $90 \%$ of the fixed macrophages of the reticuloendothelial system.

The liver has the capacity to convert important hormones and vitamins into a more active form. Examples include the initial hydroxylation of vitamin D and the deiodination of the thyroid hormone thyroxine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$ to triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$. Moreover, numerous enzymes in the liver process lipophilic chemicals into more polar, water-soluble metabolites, which are more readily excreted into bile.

Bile is a complex secretory product produced by the liver. Biliary secretion has two principal functions: (1) elimination from the body of many endogenous and exogenous waste products, such as bilirubin and cholesterol; and (2) promotion of digestion and absorption of lipids from the intestine. The composition of bile is modified significantly as a result of the absorptive and secretory properties of epithelial cells that line the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. Moreover, bile solutes are further concentrated as bile is stored in the gallbladder.

## The liver stores carbohydrates, lipids, vitamins, and minerals; it synthesizes carbohydrates, protein, and intermediary metabolites

The products of digested food, including carbohydrates, peptides, vitamins, and some lipids, are avidly extracted from portal blood by the liver. Depending on the metabolic requirements of the body, these substrates may be stored by the hepatocytes or released into the bloodstream either unbound (e.g., glucose) or associated with a carrier molecule (e.g., a triacylglycerol molecule complexed to a lipoprotein).

The liver also synthesizes-in a highly regulated fashionmany substances that are essential to the metabolic demands of the body. These substances include albumin, coagulation factors, and other plasma proteins; glucose; cholesterol; fatty acids for triacylglycerol biosynthesis; and phospholipids. The liver must provide a supply of substrates as fuels for other organs, particularly in the fasted state. For example, the liver produces ketone bodies, which can be used by the central nervous system during periods of fasting; this use of ketone bodies as fuel spares $\sim 50 \%$ of the amount of glucose that would otherwise be used by this tissue. Thus, the liver has a critical and unique role in the energy metabolism of all nonhepatic organs.

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE LIVER AND BILIARY TREE

## Hepatocytes are secretory epithelial cells separating the lumen of bile canaliculi from the fenestrated endothelium of sinusoids

One way of looking at the organization of the liver is to imagine that a classic lobule is a hexagon in cross section (Fig. 46-1A) with a branch of the hepatic vein at its center and, at each of the six corners, triads composed of branches of the hepatic artery, portal vein, and bile duct. Hepatocytes account for $\sim 80 \%$ of the parenchymal volume in human liver. Hepatocytes form an epithelium, one cell thick, that constitutes a functional barrier between two fluid compartments with differing ionic compositions: the tiny canalicular lumen containing bile, and the much larger sinusoid containing blood (see Fig. 46-1B). Moreover, hepatocytes significantly alter the composition of these fluids

![bo814869338f](bo814869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-1 Hepatocytes, sinusoids, and the intrahepatic bile system.
by vectorial transport of solutes across the hepatocyte. This vectorial transport depends critically on the polarized distribution of specific transport mechanisms and receptors that are localized to the apical membrane that faces the canalicular lumen and the basolateral membrane that faces the pericellular space between hepatocytes and the blood-filled sinusoid (see Fig. 46-1B, C). As in other epithelia, the apical and basolateral membrane domains of hepatocytes are structurally, biochemically, and physiologically distinct.

The space of Disse, or perisinusoidal space, is the extracellular gap between the endothelial cells lining the sinusoids
and the basolateral membranes of the hepatocytes. These basolateral membranes have microvilli that project into the space of Disse to facilitate contact with the solutes in sinusoidal blood. The microvilli greatly amplify the surface of the basolateral membrane, which accounts for $\sim 85 \%$ of the total surface area of the hepatocyte.

The bile canaliculi, into which bile is initially secreted, are formed by the apical membranes of adjoining hepatocytes. The apical membrane of the hepatocyte runs as a narrow belt that encircles and grooves into the polygonal hepatocyte (see Fig. 46-1B, C). Two adjacent hepatocytes form a canaliculus that is $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter by juxtaposing their groove-like

apical membranes along their common face (i.e., one side of the polygon). Because a hepatocyte has many sides and a different neighbor on each side, the canaliculi form a chicken wire-like pattern along the contiguous surfaces of hepatocytes and communicate to form a three-dimensional tubular network. Although the apical membrane belt is very narrow (i.e., $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ), its extensive microvillous structure amplifies its surface area so that the canalicular membrane constitutes as much as $15 \%$ of the total membrane surface area. Because of this high surface-to-volume ratio, the total apical surface area available for the movement of water and solutes in the human liver is in excess of $10.5 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$.

The seal that joins the apical membranes of two juxtaposed hepatocytes and that separates the canalicular lumen from the pericellular space-which is contiguous with the space of Disse-comprises several elements, including tight junctions (see Fig. 46-1D) and desmosomes (see p. 45). By virtue of their permeability and morphology, hepatic junctions can be classified as having an intermediate tightness, somewhere between that of tight epithelia (e.g., toad bladder) and leaky epithelia (e.g., proximal tubule). Specialized structures called gap junctions (see pp. 158-159) allow functional communication between adjacent hepatocytes.

Hepatocytes do not have a true basement membrane, but rather they rest on complex scaffolding provided by the extracellular matrix in the space of Disse, which includes several types of collagens (I, III, IV, V, and VI), fibronectin, undulin, laminin, and proteoglycans. Cells are linked to the matrix through specific adhesion proteins on the cell surface. The extracellular matrix not only provides structural support for liver cells but also seems to influence and maintain the phenotypic expression of hepatocytes and sinusoidal lining cells.

## The liver contains endothelial cells, macrophages (Kupffer cells), and stellate cells (Ito cells) within the sinusoidal spaces

Slightly more than 6\% of the volume of the liver parenchyma is made up of cells other than hepatocytes, including endothelial cells ( $2.8 \%$ ), Kupffer cells ( $2.1 \%$ ), and stellate cells (fat-storing or Ito cells, $1.4 \%$ ). The endothelial cells that line the vascular channels or sinusoids form a fenestrated structure with their bodies and cytoplasmic extensions. Plasma solutes, but not blood cells, can move freely into the space of Disse through pores, or fenestrae, in the endothelial cells. Some evidence indicates that the fenestrae may regulate access into the perisinusoidal space of Disse by means of their capacity to contract.

The Kupffer cells are present within the sinusoidal vascular space. (46-1 This population of fixed macrophages removes particulate matter from the circulation. Stellate cells are in the space of Disse and are characterized morphologically by the presence of large fat droplets in their cytoplasm. These cells play a central role in the storage of vitamin A , and evidence suggests that they can be transformed into proliferative, fibrogenic, and contractile myofibroblasts. On liver injury, these activated cells participate in fibrogenesis through remodeling of the extracellular matrix, production of cytokines, and deposition of type I collagen, which can lead to cirrhosis.

## The liver has a dual blood supply, but a single venous drainage system

The blood supply to the liver has two sources. The portal vein contributes $\sim 75 \%$ of the total circulation to the liver; the hepatic artery contributes the other 25\% (Fig. 46-2A). Blood from portal venules and hepatic arterioles combines in a complex network of hepatic sinusoids (see Fig. 46-2B). Blood from these sinusoids converges on terminal hepatic venules (or central veins), which, in turn, join to form the hepatic veins (see Fig. 46-2C). Branches of the portal vein, hepatic artery, and a bile duct (i.e., the triad), as well as lymphatics and nerves, travel together as a portal tract.

The arterial supply for the bile ducts arises mainly from the right hepatic artery (see Fig. 46-2C). These arterioles give rise to an extraordinarily rich plexus of capillaries that surround the bile ducts as they pass through the portal tracts. Blood flowing through this peribiliary plexus empties into the sinusoids by way of branches of the portal vein so that this blood may pick up solutes from the bile ducts and cycle them back to the hepatocytes. Thus, the peribiliary plexus may provide the means for modifying biliary secretions through the bidirectional exchange of compounds such as proteins, inorganic ions, and bile acids between the bile and blood within the portal tract.

## Hepatocytes can be thought of as being arranged as classic hepatic lobules, portal lobules, or acinar units

The complex structure of the liver makes it difficult to define a single unit-something analogous to the nephron in the kidney-that is capable of performing the functions of the entire liver. One way of viewing the organization of the liver is depicted in Figures 46-1 and 46-2, in which we regard the central vein as the core of the classic hepatic lobule. Thus, the classic hepatic lobule (Fig. 46-3A) includes all hepatocytes drained by a single central vein, and it is bounded by two or more portal triads. Alternatively, we can view the liver as though the triad is the core of a portal lobule (see Fig. 46-3B). Thus, the portal lobule includes all hepatocytes drained by a single bile ductule and is bounded by two or more central veins. A third way of viewing the liver is to group the hepatocytes according to their supply of arterial blood (see Fig. 46-3C). Thus, the portal acinus is a small three-dimensional mass of hepatocytes that are irregular in size and shape, with one axis formed by a line between two triads (i.e., high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ) and another axis formed by a line between two central veins (i.e., low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ).

## Periportal hepatocytes specialize in oxidative metabolism, whereas pericentral hepatocytes detoxify drugs

Rappaport first proposed that a zonal relationship exists between cells that constitute the portal acini and their blood supply (see Fig. 46-3C). Hepatocytes close to the vascular core formed by the terminal portal venule and terminal hepatic arteriole are perfused first and thus receive the highest concentrations of oxygen and solutes. These periportal hepatocytes are said to reside in zone I, and as a consequence of their location, they are the most resistant to the

# N46-1 Kupffer Cells 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Kupffer cells-or Browicz-Kupffer cells-are part of the reticuloendothelial system. They were originally described in 1876 by Karl Wilhelm von Kupffer, who incorrectly thought that they were part of the endothelium of the liver. In 1898, Tadeusz Browicz correctly identified them as macrophages.

![bo824869338f](bo824869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-2 Blood supply to the liver.
effects of circulatory compromise or nutritional deficiency. These cells are also more resistant to other forms of cellular injury and are the first to regenerate. Hepatocytes in the intermediate zone II and the most distal population of pericentral hepatocytes located near the terminal hepatic venule (central vein) in zone III are sequentially perfused with blood that is already modified by the preceding hepatocytes; thus, they are exposed to progressively lower concentrations of nutrients and oxygen. The exact boundaries of these zones are difficult to define.

The concept of zonal heterogeneity of liver function has evolved as a result of these differences in access to substrate. Because of the specialized microenvironments of cells in different zones, some enzymes are preferentially expressed in one zone or another (Table 46-1). For example, in zone I, oxidative energy metabolism with $\beta$-oxidation, amino-acid metabolism, ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis, cholesterol synthesis, and bile formation is particularly important. Localized in zone III are glycogen synthesis from glucose, glycolysis, liponeogenesis, ketogenesis, xenobiotic metabolism, and glutamine formation. Molecular techniques have allowed an even more precise definition of which hepatocytes express particular messenger RNA (mRNA) and proteins. For example, the enzyme glutamine synthetase is expressed exclusively in only one or two hepatocytes immediately adjacent to the hepatic venules. Hepatocytes of zone III also seem to be important for general detoxification mechanisms and the biotransformation of drugs. The zonal distribution of drug-induced toxicity manifested as cell necrosis may be attributed to zone III localization of the enzymatic pathways involved in the biotransformation of substrates by oxidation, reduction, or hydrolysis. Although it appears that each hepatocyte is potentially capable of multiple metabolic functions, the predominant enzymatic activity appears to result from adaptation to the microenvironment provided by the hepatic microcirculation. In some cases, it

C, The portal acinus emphasizes the arterial blood supply to the hepatocytes and thus the oxygenation gradient between a branch of the hepatic artery and branches of the hepatic vein (i.e., central vein).

has been possible to reverse the zone I-to-zone III gradient of hepatocyte function by experimentally reversing the direction of blood supply (i.e., nutrient flow).

## Bile drains from canaliculi into small terminal ductules, then into larger ducts, and eventually, via a single common duct, into the duodenum

The adult human liver has $>2 \mathrm{~km}$ of bile ductules and ducts, with a volume of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$ and a macroscopic surface area of
$\sim 400 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Microvilli at the apical surface magnify this area by $\sim 5.5$-fold.

As noted above, the canaliculi into which bile is secreted form a three-dimensional polygonal meshwork of tubes between hepatocytes, with many anastomotic interconnections (see Fig. 46-1). From the canaliculi, the bile enters the small terminal bile ductules (i.e., canals of Hering), which have a basement membrane and in cross section are surrounded by three to six ductal epithelial cells or hepatocytes (Fig. 46-4A). The canals of Hering then empty into a system of perilobular ducts, which, in turn, drain into interlobular bile ducts. The interlobular bile ducts form a richly anastomosing network that closely surrounds the branches of the portal vein. These bile ducts are lined by a layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium that has microvillous architecture on its luminal surface. The cells have a prominent Golgi apparatus and numerous vesicles, which probably participate in the exchange of substances among the cytoplasm, bile, and blood plasma through exocytosis and endocytosis.

The interlobular bile ducts unite to form larger and larger ducts, first the septal ducts and then the lobar ducts, two hepatic ducts, and finally a common hepatic duct (see Fig. 46-4B). Along the biliary tree, the biliary epithelial cells, or cholangiocytes, are similar in their fine structure except for size and height. However, as discussed below (see pp. 960-961), in terms of their functional properties, cholangiocytes and bile ducts of different sizes are heterogeneous in their expression of enzymes, receptors, and transporters. Increasing emphasis has been placed on the absorptive and secretory properties of the biliary epithelial cells, properties that contribute significantly to the process of bile formation. As with other epithelial cells, cholangiocytes are highly cohesive, with the lateral plasma membranes of contiguous cells

The ductules eventually merge into perilobular ducts, and then interlobular ducts. B, The interlobular ducts merge into septal ducts and lobar ducts (not shown), and eventually the right and left hepatic ducts, which combine as the common hepatic duct. The confluence of the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct gives rise to the common bile duct. The common bile duct may merge with the pancreatic duct and form the ampulla of Vater before entering the duodenum, as shown in the figure, or have a completely independent lumen. In either case, there is a common sphincter-the sphincter of Oddi-that simultaneously regulates flow out of the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct.
forming tortuous interdigitations. Tight junctions seal contacts between cells that are close to the luminal region and thus limit the exchange of water and solutes between plasma and bile.

The common hepatic duct emerges from the porta hepatis after the union of the right and left hepatic ducts. It merges with the cystic duct emanating from the gallbladder to form the common bile duct. In adults, the common bile duct is quite large, $\sim 7 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and $\sim 0.5$ to 1.5 cm in diameter. In most individuals, the common bile duct and the pancreatic duct merge before forming a common antrum known as the ampulla of Vater. At the point of transit through the duodenal wall, this common channel is surrounded by a thickening of both the longitudinal and the circular layers of smooth muscle, the so-called sphincter of Oddi. This sphincter constricts the lumen of the bile duct and thus regulates the flow of bile into the duodenum. The hormone cholecystokinin (CCK) relaxes the sphincter of Oddi via a nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neural pathway (see pp. 344-345) involving vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP).

The gallbladder lies in a fossa beneath the right lobe of the liver. This distensible pear-shaped structure has a capacity of 30 to 50 mL in adults. The absorptive surface of the gallbladder is enhanced by numerous prominent folds that
are important for concentrative transport activity, as discussed below. The gallbladder is connected at its neck to the cystic duct, which empties into the common bile duct (see Fig. 46-4B). The cystic duct maintains continuity with the surface columnar epithelium, lamina propria, muscularis, and serosa of the gallbladder. Instead of a sphincter, the gallbladder has, at its neck, a spiral valve-the valve of Heister-formed by the mucous membrane. This valve regulates flow into and out of the gallbladder.

## UPTAKE, PROCESSING, AND SECRETION OF COMPOUNDS BY HEPATOCYTES

The liver metabolizes an enormous variety of compounds that are brought to it by the portal and systemic circulations. These compounds include endogenous molecules (e.g., bile salts and bilirubin, which are key ingredients of bile) and exogenous molecules (e.g., drugs and toxins). The hepatocyte handles these molecules in four major steps (Fig. 46-5A): (1) the hepatocyte imports the compound from the blood across its basolateral (i.e., sinusoidal) membrane, (2) the hepatocyte transports the material within the cell, (3) the hepatocyte may chemically modify or degrade the

![bo854869338f](bo854869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-5 Transporters in hepatocyte. A, The hepatocyte can process compounds in four steps: (1) uptake from blood across the basolateral (i.e., sinusoidal) membrane; (2) transport within the cell; (3) control chemical modification or degradation; and (4) export into the bile across the apical (i.e., canalicular) membrane. B, The hepatocyte has a full complement of housekeeping transporters. C, Bile acids can enter the hepatocyte in any of several forms: the unconjugated salt (BA ${ }^{+}$); the neutral, protonated bile acid ( $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{BA}$ ); or the bile salt conjugated to taurine or glycine (BA- $\mathrm{Z}^{-}$; where Z represents taurine or glycine). The three pathways for bile acid entry across the basolateral membrane are the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven transporter NTCP, which prefers BA-Z' but also carries $\mathrm{BA}^{-}$; nonionic diffusion of $\mathrm{H}-\mathrm{BA}$; and an OATP. Binding proteins (BPs) may ferry conjugated bile acids across the cytoplasm. Some bile acids are conjugated to sulfate or glucuronate (Y); these exit the cell across the canalicular membrane via the MRP2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2) transporter. Most bile acids are conjugated to glycine or taurine (Z) prior to their extrusion into the bile via BSEP. D, Organic anions (OA), including bile acids and bilirubin, may enter across the basolateral membrane via an OATP. After conjugation with sulfate or glucuronate ( Y ), these compounds may be extruded into the bile by MRP2. GSH synthesized in the hepatocyte, after conjugation to Y , can enter the canaliculus via MRP2. Unconjugated GSH can enter the canaliculus via an unidentified transporter. GSH can exit the hepatocyte across the basolateral membrane via an OATP. AA, amino acid.

compound intracellularly, and (4) the hepatocyte excretes the molecule or its product or products into the bile across the apical (i.e., canalicular) membrane. Thus, compounds are secreted in a vectorial manner through the hepatocyte.

## An Na-K pump at the basolateral membranes of hepatocytes provides the energy for transporting a wide variety of solutes via channels and transporters

Like other epithelial cells, the hepatocyte is endowed with a host of transporters that are necessary for basic housekeeping functions. (5) N46-2 To the extent that these transporters are restricted to either the apical or basolateral membrane, they have the potential of participating in net transepithelial transport. For example, the Na-K pump (see pp. 115-117) at the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes maintains a low $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ and high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{i}$ (see Fig. 46-5B). A basolateral Ca pump (see p. 118) maintains $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ at an extremely low level, $\sim 100$ nM , as in other cells. The hepatocyte uses the inwardly directed $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient to fuel numerous active transporters, such as the Na-H exchanger, $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter, and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven amino-acid transporters. As discussed below, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient also drives one of the bile acid transporters. The hepatocyte takes up glucose via the GLUT2 facilitateddiffusion mechanism (see p. 114), which is insensitive to regulation by insulin.

The basolateral membrane has both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels. The resting membrane potential $\left(V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ of -30 to -40 mV is considerably more positive than the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$ because of the presence of numerous "leak" pathways, such as the aforementioned electrogenic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven transporters as well as $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels $\left(E_{\mathrm{Cl}}=V_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$.

## Hepatocytes take up bile acids, other organic anions, and organic cations across their basolateral (sinusoidal) membranes

Bile Acids and Salts The primary bile acids are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid, both of which are synthesized by hepatocytes (see p. 959, below). Other "secondary" bile acids form in the intestinal tract as bacteria dehydroxylate the primary bile acids. Because the $\mathrm{p} K$ values of the primary bile acids are near neutrality, most of the bile acid molecules are neutral; that is, they are bile acids ( $\mathrm{H} \cdot \mathrm{BA}$ ) and thus are not very water soluble. Of course, some of these molecules are deprotonated and hence are bile salts $\left(\mathrm{BA}^{-}\right)$. The liver may conjugate the primary bile acids and salts to glycine or taurine ( Z in Fig. 46-5C), as well as to sulfate or glucuronate (Y in Fig. 46-5C). Most of the bile acids that the liver secretes into the bile are conjugated, such as taurocholate (the result of conjugating cholic acid to taurine). These conjugated derivatives have a negative charge and hence they, too, are bile salts (BA-Z ${ }^{-}$and $\mathrm{BA}-\mathrm{Y}^{-}$). Bile salts are far more water soluble than the corresponding bile acids.

Because the small intestine absorbs some bile acids and salts, they appear in the blood plasma, mainly bound to albumin, and are presented to the hepatocytes for re-uptake. This recycling of bile acids, an example of enterohepatic circulation (see p. 962 below). Dissociation from albumin occurs before uptake. Surprisingly, the presence of albumin actually stimulates $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent taurocholate uptake,
perhaps by increasing the affinity of the transporter for taurocholate.

Uptake of bile acids has been studied extensively and is mediated predominantly by an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled transporter known as Na/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide or NTCP (a member of the SLC10A1 family; see Fig. 46-5C). This transporter is a $50-\mathrm{kDa}$ glycosylated protein, and it appears to have seven membrane-spanning segments. NTCP handles unconjugated bile acids, but it has a particularly high affinity for conjugated bile acids. In addition, NTCP can also transport other compounds, including neutral steroids (e.g., progesterone, $17 \beta$-estradiol sulfate), cyclic oligopeptides (e.g., amantadine and phalloidin), and a wide variety of drugs (e.g., verapamil, furosemide). (5) N46-3

Although NTCP also carries unconjugated bile acids, as much as $50 \%$ of these unconjugated bile acids may enter the hepatocyte by passive nonionic diffusion (see Fig. 46-5B). Because unconjugated bile acids are weak acids of the form

$$
\mathrm{H} \cdot \mathrm{BA} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{BA}^{-}
$$

the neutral $\mathrm{H} \cdot \mathrm{BA}$ form can diffuse into the cell. Conjugation of bile acids enhances their hydrophilicity (taurine more so than glycine) and promotes dissociation of the proton from the side chain (i.e., lowers the $\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{a}}$ ), thus raising the concentration of $\mathrm{BA}^{-}$. Both properties decrease the ability of bile acid to traverse membranes via passive nonionic diffusion.

Organic Anions The organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) are members of the SLC21 family (see p. 125) (5) N46-4 and mediate the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent uptake of a wide spectrum of endogenous and exogenous amphipathic compounds-including bile acids, bilirubin, eicosanoids, steroid and thyroid hormones, prostaglandins, statin drugs, methotrexate, bromosulfophthalein, and many xenobiotics. Individual OATPs share considerable overlap in substrate specificity and can substantially influence the pharmacokinetics and pharmacological efficacy of drugs they carry. OATPs-predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning segments, with intracellular amino and carboxy terminiappear to exchange organic anions for intracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ (see Fig. 46-5C, D). Expression of OATPs is under the control, in a cell- and tissue-specific way, of nuclear receptors (FXR, LXR, SXR, CAR; see Table 3-6) and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF4). OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 are liver specific and are located on the sinusoidal (basolateral) membrane of hepatocytes.

Thus, the basolateral uptake of bile acids into the hepatocyte is a complex process that involves both an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent transporter (NTCP) and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent transporters(OATPs), as well as nonionic diffusion of unconjugated bile acids.

Bilirubin Senescent erythrocytes are taken up by macrophages in the reticuloendothelial system, where the degradation of hemoglobin leads to the release of bilirubin into the blood (Fig. 46-6A and Box 46-1). The mechanism by which hepatocytes take up unconjugated bilirubin remains controversial. As evidenced by yellow staining of the sclerae and skin in the jaundiced patient, bilirubin can leave the

## N46-2 Hepatocyte Housekeeping Functions

As noted in the text, the basolateral membrane of the hepatocyte has both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels. The basolateral $\mathrm{K}^{+}$conductance is high and is regulated by cAMP, $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{c}$ cell volume, and temperature. The basolateral $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$conductance is under the regulation of hormones and cell volume.

As is the case for most cells, hepatocytes actively regulate their intracellular pH (see pp. 644-645) using two acid extruders, the basolateral (i.e., sinusoidal) $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger and an electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter. The apical (i.e., canalicular) $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger may contribute as an acid loader. The pH gradient across the canalicular membrane also drives the transport of inorganic solutes (e.g., $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}-\mathrm{SO}_{4}$ exchange) and maintains the transmembrane gradients of weak acids and bases that cross the membrane by nonionic diffusion (see p. 784).

## N46-4 Organic Anion Transporters

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The organic-anion transporting proteins (OATPs) have now been classified as members of the SLC21 gene family (see Table 5-4). For a detailed discussion of the family members, consult the review by Hagenbuch and Meier listed below.

Note that some have inappropriately stated that because this family has an immense number of genes, it really ought to be treated as a superfamily, with the designation SLCO (here the $O$ refers to "organic"). However, the superfamily is large only when one includes genes from all known organisms. The actual number of OATP genes in any given vertebrate organism (humans have 11 such genes) is about the same as for other SLC families. Thus, the OATPs are appropriately described as a "family."

## N46-3 Regulation of Na/Taurocholate Cotransport

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Bile acid uptake via the Na/taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is under the regulation of several second messengers. For example, cAMP stimulates taurocholate uptake, whereas this effect is blocked by inhibitors of protein kinase A. This direct stimulation presumably reflects the phosphorylation of the transporter or an essential activator. cAMP also stimulates uptake indirectly by increasing translocation of the transport protein to the membrane.

Certain hormones, such as prolactin, also stimulate bile acid uptake directly.

As is the case for many other transporters, NTCP activity is low in the fetus and neonate and increases with development.

NTCP has now been classified as a member of the SLC10 gene family (see Table 5-4) of $\mathrm{Na} /$ bile-salt cotransporters. For a detailed discussion of the family members, consult the review by Hagenbuch and Dawson listed below.

A HEME METABOLISM
![bo864869338f](bo864869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-6 Excretion of bilirubin. A, Macrophages phagocytose senescent red blood cells and break the heme down to bilirubin, which travels in the blood, linked to albumin, to the liver. The conversion to the colorless urobilinogen occurs in the terminal ileum and colon, whereas the oxidation to the yellowish urobilin occurs in the urine. B, The hepatocyte takes up bilirubin across its basolateral membrane via an OATP and other unidentified mechanisms. The hepatocyte then conjugates the bilirubin with one or two glucuronic acid residues and exports this conjugated form of bilirubin into the bile. Bacteria in the terminal ileum and colon convert some of this bilirubin glucuronide back to bilirubin. This bilirubin is further converted to the colorless urobilinogen. If it remains in the colon, the compound is further converted to stercobilin, which is the main pigment of feces. If the urobilinogen enters the plasma and is filtered by the kidney, it is converted to urobilin and gives urine its characteristic yellow color.

# BOX 46-1 Jaundice 

Jaundice denotes a yellowish discoloration of body tissues, most notable in the skin and sclera of the eyes. The condition is caused by an accumulation of bilirubin in extracellular fluid, either in free form or after conjugation. Bilirubin is a yellowgreen pigment that is the principal degradation product of heme (see Fig. 46-6A), a prosthetic group in several proteins, including hemoglobin.

The metabolism of hemoglobin ( Hb ) of senescent red cells accounts for $65 \%$ to $80 \%$ of total bilirubin production. Hb released into the circulation is phagocytized by macrophages throughout the body, which split Hb into globin and heme. Cleavage of the heme ring releases both free iron, which travels in the blood by transferrin, and a straight chain of 4-pyrrole nuclei called biliverdin (see Fig. 46-6A), which the cell rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. This lipophilic form of bilirubin is often referred to as unconjugated bilirubin. After it enters the circulation, unconjugated bilirubin binds reversibly to albumin and travels to the liver, which avidly removes it from the plasma (see Fig. 46-6B). After hepatocytes take up bilirubin, they use UGT1A1 to convert the bilirubin to monoglucuronide and diglucuronide conjugates. These two forms of water-soluble, conjugated bilirubin-which make up the direct bilirubin measured in clinical laboratoriesenter the bile canaliculus via MRP2 (see Table 5-6). Although suitable for excretion into bile, conjugated bilirubin cannot be absorbed by the biliary or intestinal epithelia.

Because of avid extraction and conjugation of bilirubin by the liver, the normal plasma concentration of bilirubin, which is mostly of the unconjugated variety, is $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ or lower. The skin or eyes may begin to appear jaundiced when the bilirubin level rises to 1.5 to $3 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$.

Jaundice occurs under several circumstances. Increased destruction of red blood cells or hemolysis may cause unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Transient physiological neonatal jaundice results from an increased turnover of red blood cells combined with the immaturity of the pathways for conjugation of bilirubin (exacerbated in premature infants) Pathological conditions that can increase bilirubin production in neonates include isoimmunization, heritable hemolytic disorders, and extravasated blood (e.g., from bruises and cephalhematomas). Genetic disorders of bilirubin conjugation include the mild deficiency of UGT1A1 seen in the common Gilbert syndrome and
the near-complete or complete deficiency of UGT1A1 seen in the rare Crigler-Najjar syndrome. Extreme unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia can lead to a form of brain damage called kernicterus (from the Dutch kern [nucleus, as in a brain nucleus] + the Greek icteros [jaundice]). Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia is often treated with phototherapy, which converts bilirubin to photoisomers and colorless oxidation products that are less lipophilic than bilirubin and do not require hepatic conjugation for excretion. Photoisomers are excreted mainly in the bile, and oxidation products, predominantly in the urine.

Jaundice can also result from defects in the secretion of conjugated bilirubin from hepatocytes into bile canaliculi (as with certain types of liver damage) or from defects in transiting the bilirubin to the small intestine (as with obstruction of the bile ducts). In either case, conjugated bilirubin refluxes back into the systemic circulation, where it now accounts for most of the bilirubin in plasma. Because the kidneys can filter the highly soluble conjugated bilirubin-in contrast to the poorly soluble free form of bilirubin mostly bound to albumin-it appears in the urine. Thus, in obstructive jaundice, conjugated bilirubin imparts a dark yellow color to the urine. Measurement of free and conjugated bilirubin in serum serves as a sensitive test for detecting liver disease.

Under normal conditions, approximately half of the bilirubin reaching the intestinal lumen is metabolized by bacteria into the colorless urobilinogen (see Fig. 46-6A). The intestinal mucosa reabsorbs $\sim 20 \%$ of this soluble compound into the portal circulation. The liver then extracts most of the urobilinogen and re-excretes it into the gastrointestinal tract. The kidneys excrete a small fraction ( $\sim 20 \%$ of daily urobilinogen production) into the urine. Urobilinogen may be detected in urine by using a clinical dipstick test. Oxidation of urobilinogen yields urobilin, which gives urine its yellow color. In the feces, metabolism of urobilinogen yields stercobilin, which contributes to the color of feces. In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the intestine for conversion into urobilinogen, and therefore no urobilinogen appears in the blood for excretion by the kidney. As a result, tests for urobilinogen in urine are negative in obstructive jaundice. Because of the lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments in obstructive jaundice, the stool becomes clay colored.
circulation and enter tissues by diffusion. However, uptake of albumin-bound bilirubin by the isolated, perfused rat liver and isolated rat hepatocytes is faster than can occur by diffusion and is consistent with a carrier-mediated process. Electroneutral, electrogenic, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$-dependent transport have been proposed (see Fig. 46-6B).

OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 can transport conjugated, and possibly unconjugated, bilirubin in vitro. Indeed, human mutations resulting in the complete deficiency of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 cause Rotor syndrome, a relatively benign autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugatednot unconjugated-hyperbilirubinemia. How did this conjugated bilirubin-made only in hepatocytes-get into the blood? It is now clear that hepatocytes secrete substantial amounts of glucuronidated bilirubin across the sinusoidal membrane into the space of Disse and that OATP1B1/ OATP1B3 is responsible for the reuptake of this conjugated bilirubin under physiological conditions. Other hepatic
mechanisms may mediate the uptake of unconjugated bilirubin.

Organic Cations The major organic cations transported by the liver are aromatic and aliphatic amines, including important drugs such as cholinergics, local anesthetics, and antibiotics, as well as endogenous solutes such as choline, thiamine, and nicotinamide (Fig. 46-7). At physiological pH, $\sim 40 \%$ of drugs are organic cations, in equilibrium with their respective conjugate weak bases (see p. 628). Members of the organic cation transporter (OCT) family mediate the uptake of a variety of structurally diverse lipophilic organic cations of endogenous or xenobiotic origin (see p. 115). OCT-mediated transport is electrogenic, independent of an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion or proton gradient, and may occur in either direction across the plasma membrane. Human hepatocytes express only OCT1 (SLC22A1) and OCT3 (SLC22A3), localized to the sinusoidal membrane. OCT1 and OCT3 have

partly overlapping substrate specificities. OCT1 is also present in the plasma membrane of cholangiocytes. Acyclovir and lidocaine are examples of OCT1 substrates. The neurotransmitters epinephrine, norepinephrine, and histamine are exclusive OCT3 substrates. In addition to the OCTs, members of the OATP family as well as an electroneutral proton-cation exchanger may contribute to organic cation uptake across the basolateral membrane.

Neutral Organic Compounds This group of molecules is also taken up by an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent, energy-dependent process, although the nature of the driving force is not known. The best-characterized substrate is ouabain, uptake of which is inhibited by other neutral steroids, such as cortisol, aldosterone, estradiol, and testosterone. OATP1B1 transports some of these compounds.

We return to Figures 46-5 through 46-7 below, when we discuss the movement of solutes into the bile canaliculus.

## Inside the hepatocyte, the basolateral-to-apical movement of many compounds occurs by protein-bound or vesicular routes

Bile Salts Some compounds traverse the cell while bound to intracellular "binding" proteins (see Fig. 46-5C). The binding may serve to trap the molecule within the cell, or it may be involved in intracellular transport. For bile salts, three such proteins have been identified. In humans, the main bile acid-binding protein appears to be the hepatic dihydrodiol dehydrogenase, one of a large family of dehydrogenases, the catalytic and binding properties of which are organ and species specific. The two others are glutathioneS-transferase B and fatty acid-binding protein. Intracellular sequestration of bile salts by these proteins may serve an important role in bile acid transport or regulation of bile acid synthesis. Transcellular diffusion of bile salts bound to
proteins can be detected within seconds after bile salts are applied to hepatocytes; this mechanism may be the primary mode of cytoplasmic transport under basal conditions. Free, unbound bile acids may also traverse the hepatocyte by rapid diffusion.

At high sinusoidal concentrations, hydrophobic bile acids may partition into membranes of intracellular vesicles. These conditions may also cause increased targeting of the vesicles to the canalicular membrane-that is, transcellular bile acid transport by a vesicular pathway. Whether transcellular transport occurs by protein-binding or vesicular pathways, it is unknown how bile acids are so efficiently targeted to the canalicular membrane for excretion into bile.

Bilirubin After uptake at the basolateral membrane, unconjugated bilirubin is transported to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where it is conjugated to glucuronic acid (see Fig. 46-6). Because the resulting bilirubin glucuronide is markedly hydrophobic, it was thought that intracellular transport was mediated by binding proteins such as glutathione-S-transferase B. However, spontaneous transfer of bilirubin between phospholipid vesicles occurs by rapid movement through the aqueous phase, in the absence of soluble proteins. Thus, direct membrane-to-membrane transfer may be the principal mode of bilirubin transport within the hepatocyte. In addition, the membrane-tomembrane flux of bilirubin is biased toward the membrane with the higher cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. Hence, the inherent gradient for cholesterol from the basolateral membrane to the ER membrane may direct the flux of bilirubin to the ER.

## In phase I of the biotransformation of organic anions and other compounds, hepatocytes use mainly cytochrome P-450 enzymes

The liver is responsible for the metabolism and detoxification of many endogenous and exogenous compounds. Some compounds taken up by hepatocytes (e.g., proteins and other ligands) are completely digested within lysosomes. Specific carriers exist for the lysosomal uptake of sialic acid, cysteine, and vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. Clinical syndromes resulting from an absence of these carriers have also been identified. The lysosomal acid hydrolases cleave sulfates, fatty acids, and sugar moieties from larger molecules.

Hepatocytes handle other compounds by biotransformation reactions that usually occur in three phases. Phase I reactions represent oxidation or reduction reactions in large part catalyzed by the P-450 cytochromes. The diverse array of phase I reactions includes hydroxylation, dealkylation, and dehalogenation, among others. The common feature of all of these reactions is that one atom of oxygen is inserted into the substrate. Hence, these monooxygenases make the substrate $(\mathrm{RH})$ a more polar compound, poised for further modification by a phase II reaction. For example, when the phase I reaction creates a hydroxyl group ( ROH ), the phase II reaction may increase the water solubility of ROH by conjugating it to a highly hydrophilic compound such as glucuronate, sulfate, or glutathione:

$$
\mathrm{RH} \xrightarrow{\text { Phase I }} \mathrm{ROH} \xrightarrow{\text { Phase II }} \mathrm{RO}-\mathrm{Conjugate}
$$

Finally, in phase III, the conjugated compound moves out of the liver via transporters on the sinusoidal and canalicular membranes.

The P-450 cytochromes are the major enzymes involved in phase I reactions. Cytochromes are colored proteins that contain heme for use in the transfer of electrons. Some cytochromes-not the P-450 system-are essential for the electron transport events that culminate in oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria. The P-450 cytochromes, so named because they absorb light at 450 nm when bound to CO , are a diverse but related group of enzymes that reside mainly in the ER and typically catalyze hydroxylation reactions. Fifty-seven human CYP genes encode hundreds of variants of cytochrome P-450 enzymes (see Table 50-2). Genetic polymorphisms exist in the genes encoding all the main P-450 enzymes that contribute to drug and other xenobiotic metabolism, and the distribution and frequency of variant alleles can vary markedly among populations.

In this text, we encounter P-450 oxidases in two sets of organs. In cells that synthesize steroid hormones-the adrenal cortex (see p. 1021), testes (see p. 1097), and ovary (see p. 1117) and placenta (see Table 56-5)-the P-450 oxidases are localized either in the mitochondria or in the ER, where they catalyze various steps in steroidogenesis. In the liver, these enzymes are located in the ER, where they catalyze a vast array of hydroxylation reactions involving the metabolism of drugs and chemical carcinogens, bile acid synthesis, and the activation and inactivation of vitamins. The same reactions occur in other tissues, such as the intestines and the lungs.

Hepatic microsomal P-450 enzymes have similar molecular weights ( 48 to 56 kDa ). The functional protein is a holoenzyme that consists of an apoprotein and a heme prosthetic group. The apoprotein region confers substrate specificity, which differs among the many P-450 enzymes. These substrates include RH moieties that are as wide ranging as the terminal methyl group of fatty acids, carbons in the rings of steroid molecules, complex heterocyclic compounds, and phenobarbital. In general, phase I processes add or expose a functional group, a hydroxyl group in the case of the P-450 oxidases, which renders the molecule reactive with phase II enzymes. The metabolic products of phase I may be directly excreted, but more commonly, because of only a modest increment in solubility, further metabolism by phase II reactions is required.

## In phase II of biotransformation, conjugation of phase I products makes them more water soluble for secretion into blood or bile

In phase II, the hepatocyte conjugates the metabolites generated in phase I to produce more hydrophilic compounds, such as glucuronides, sulfates, and mercapturic acids. These phase II products are readily secreted into the blood or bile. Conjugation reactions are generally considered to be the critical step in detoxification. Either a defect in a particular enzyme, which may result from a genetic defect, or saturation of the enzyme with excess substrate may result in a decrease in the overall elimination of a compound. One example is gray syndrome, a potentially fatal condition that occurs after the administration of chloramphenicol to
newborns who have low glucuronidation capacity. Infants have an ashen gray appearance and become weak and apathetic, and complete circulatory collapse may ensue.
Hepatocytes use three major conjugation reactions:

1. Conjugation to glucuronate. The uridine diphosphateglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), which reside in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) of the liver, are divided into two families based on their substrate specificity. The UGT1 family consists of at least nine members encoded by genes located on chromosome 2. These UGTs catalyze the conjugation of glucuronic acid with phenols or bilirubin (see Fig. 46-6B). The UGT2 family contains at least nine UGTs encoded by genes on chromosome 4. These UGTs catalyze the glucuronidation of steroids or bile acids. The two members of the UGT3 family reside on chromosome 5. Because UGT1s are essential for the dual conjugation of bilirubin (see Fig. 46-6B) and because only conjugated bilirubin can be excreted in bile, congenital absence of UGT1A1 activity results in jaundice from birth and bilirubin encephalopathy, as seen in patients with Crigler-Najjar syndrome type I.
2. Conjugation to sulfate. The sulfotransferases-which are located in the cytosol rather than in the SER-catalyze the sulfation of steroids, catechols, and foreign compounds such as alcohol and metabolites of carcinogenic hydrocarbons. Their substrate specificity is greater than that of the UGTs. The different cellular localization of these two groups of enzymes suggests that they act cooperatively rather than competitively. In general, sulfates are not toxic and are readily eliminated, with the exception of sulfate esters of certain carcinogens.
3. Conjugation to glutathione. Hepatocytes also conjugate a range of compounds to reduced glutathione (GSH) for excretion and later processing in either the bile ducts or kidney (Fig. 46-8). Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate $\gamma$-linked to cysteine, which, in turn, is $\alpha$-linked to glycine. The liver has the highest concentration of glutathione ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{mM}$ ), with $\sim 90 \%$ found in the cytoplasm and $10 \%$ in the mitochondria. Glutathione-S-transferases, which are mainly cytosolic, catalyze the conjugation of certain substrates to the cysteine moiety of GSH. Substrates include the electrophilic metabolites of lipophilic compounds (e.g., epoxides of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), products of lipid peroxidation, and alkyl and aryl halides. In some cases, the conjugates are then secreted into bile and are further modified by removing the glutamyl residue from the glutathione by $\gamma$-glutamyl transpeptidase on the bile duct epithelial cell. The fate of glutathione-S-conjugates in bile is largely unknown. Some (e.g., the leukotrienes) undergo enterohepatic circulation. In other cases, the glutathione conjugates are secreted into plasma and are filtered by the kidney, where a $\gamma$-glutamyl transpeptidase on the proximal tubule brush border again removes the glutamyl residue. Next, a dipeptidase removes the glycine residue to produce a cysteine-$S$-conjugate. The cysteine-S-conjugate is either excreted in the urine or is acetylated in the kidney or liver to form a mercapturic acid derivative, which is also excreted in the urine. Although glutathione conjugation is generally considered a detoxification reaction, several such conjugates undergo activation into highly reactive intermediates.

Figure 46-8 Conjugation to GSH and formation of mercapturic acids. The first step is for glutathione-Stransferase to couple the target compound (R) to the S on the cysteine residue of GSH. After MRP2 transports this GSH conjugate into the canalicular lumen (see Fig. 46-5D), a $\gamma$-glutamyl transpeptidase may remove the terminal glutamate residue. Alternatively, the conjugate may reach the blood and be filtered by the kidney where a $\gamma$-glutamyl transpeptidase at the brush border and a dipeptidase generate a cysteine derivative of R. Acetylation yields the mercapturic acid derivative, which appears in the urine.

Other forms of conjugation include methylation (e.g., catechols, amines, and thiols), acetylation (e.g., amines and hydrazines), and conjugation (e.g., bile acids) with amino acids such as taurine, glycine, or glutamine.

The involvement of multiple enzyme systems in these detoxification reactions facilitates the rapid removal of toxic species and provides alternative pathways in the event of failure of the preferred detoxification mechanism.

## In phase III of biotransformation, hepatocytes excrete products of phase I and II into bile or sinusoidal blood

Phase III involves multidrug transporters of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family (see Table 5-6)-such as MDR1 (ABCB1), MRP1 (ABCC1), and MRP2 (ABCC2)-located on the canalicular membrane. These transporters have broad substrate specificity and play an important role in protecting tissues from toxic xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites. However, their overexpression often leads to the development of resistance to anticancer drugs and can adversely affect therapy with other drugs, such as antibiotics. MRP2, which transports conjugated bilirubin, can also transport other conjugated substrates, including drugs and xenobiotics conjugated to glutathione.

ABC proteins of broad substrate specificity-such as MRP4 (ABCC4) and MRP6 (ABCC6)—are also expressed on the basolateral or sinusoidal membrane of hepatocytes. MRP4, which has been studied best, facilitates the efflux of bile-salt conjugates (see Fig. 46-5C), conjugated steroids, nucleoside analogs, eicosanoids, and cardiovascular drugs into sinusoidal blood. These sinusoidal efflux pumps are upregulated in cholestasis, which enables renal elimination of substances with compromised canalicular transport.

## The interactions of xenobiotics with nuclear receptors control phase I, II, and III

The nuclear receptors (see Table 3-6) for xenobiotics, the steroid and xenobiotic receptor (SXR, also known as the pregnane X receptor, or PXR), the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), and the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) coordinately induce genes involved in the three phases of xenobiotic biotransformation. Many xenobiotics are ligands for orphan NRs, CAR, and SXR, which heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor (RXR) and transcriptionally activate the promoters of many genes (see pp. 90-92) involved in drug metabolism. Similarly, many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons bind to AhR, which then dimerizes with the AhR nuclear translocator (ARNT), inducing cytochrome P-450 genes.

Enzymes upregulated by SXR include the phase I drugmetabolizing enzymes of the P-450 family, such as CYP3A, which metabolizes $>50 \%$ of all drugs in humans. SXR also activates the phase II enzyme glutathione-S-transferase, which is critical for catalyzing conjugation of many substrates to glutathione. SXR also upregulates MDR1 (see Table 5-6). Although these pathways are for the most part hepatoprotective, a particular compound may elicit SXR-mediated alterations in CYP3A activity that may profoundly influence the metabolism of another drug-perhaps thereby compromising the therapeutic efficacy of that drug or enhancing the production of a toxic metabolite.

The constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) is also an important regulator of drug metabolism. CAR regulates all the components of bilirubin metabolism, including uptake (possibly through OATP), conjugation (UTG1A1), and excretion (MRP2).

## Hepatocytes secrete bile acids, organic anions, organic cations, and lipids across their apical (canalicular) membranes

At the apical membrane, the transport of compounds is generally unidirectional, from cell to canalicular lumen. An exception is certain precious solutes, such as amino acids and adenosine, which are reabsorbed from bile by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent secondary active transport systems.

Bile Salts Bile-salt transport from hepatocyte to canalicular lumen (see Fig. 46-5C) occurs via an ATP-dependent transporter called the bile-salt export pump (BSEP or ABCB11; see Table 5-6). BSEP has a very high affinity for bile salts (taurochenodeoxycholate $>$ taurocholate $>$ tauroursodeoxycholate $>$ glycocholate). The electrical charge of the side chain is an important determinant of canalicular transport inasmuch as only negatively charged bile salts are effectively excreted. Secretion of bile salts occurs against a significant cell-to-canaliculus concentration gradient, which may range from $1: 100$ to $1: 1000$. Mutations in the BSEP gene can, in children, cause a form of progressive intrahepatic cholestasis that is characterized by extremely low bile acid concentrations in the bile.

Organic Anions Organic anions that are not bile salts move from the cytoplasm of the hepatocyte to the canalicular lumen largely via MRP2 (ABCC2, see Table 5-6 and Fig. 46-5D). MRP2 is electrogenic, ATP dependent, and has a broad substrate specificity (5) N46-5 - particularly for divalent, amphipathic, phase II conjugates with glutathione, glucuronide, glucuronate, and sulfates. Its substrates include bilirubin diglucuronide, sulfated bile acids, glucuronidated bile acids, and several xenobiotics. In general, transported substrates must have a hydrophobic core and at least two negative charges separated by a specific distance. MRP2 is critical for the transport of GSH conjugates across the canalicular membrane into bile. Although MRP2 has a low affinity for GSH, functional studies suggest that other mechanisms for GSH transport exist. Animal models of defective MRP2 exhibit conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which corresponds phenotypically to Dubin-Johnson syndrome in humans. Another canalicular efflux pump for sulfated conjugates is breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP or ABCG2), which transports estrone-3-sulfate (see Fig. 55-8) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (see Fig. 54-6) breakdown products of sex steroids. Other anions, such as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$, are excreted by anion exchangers.

Organic Cations Biliary excretion of organic cations is poorly understood. MDR1 (ABCB1; see Table 5-6) is present in the canalicular membrane, where it secretes into the bile canaliculus (see Fig. 46-7) bulky organic cations, including xenobiotics, cytotoxins, anticancer drugs, and other drugs (e.g., colchicine, quinidine, verapamil, cyclosporine).

Other organic cations move into the canaliculus via the multidrug and toxin extrusion 1 (MATE1) transporters, which are driven by a pH gradient (see Fig. 46-7). The MATEs are one of the most highly conserved transporter families in nature, and MATE1 is highly expressed in many tissues. Thus, transcellular cation movement in liver is
mediated by the combined action of electrogenic OCT-type uptake systems and MATE-type efflux systems.

In some cases, organic cations appear to move passively across the apical membrane into the canaliculus, sequestered by biliary micelles.

Biliary Lipids Phospholipid is a major component of bile. MDR3 (ABCB4; see Table 5-6) is a flippase that promotes the active translocation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) from the inner to the outer leaflet of the canalicular membrane. Bile salts then extract the PC from the outer leaflet so that the PC becomes a component of bile, where it participates in micelle formation. Indeed, in humans with an inherited deficiency of MDR3, progressive liver disease develops, characterized by extremely low concentrations of phospholipids in the bile.

Lipid asymmetry in the canalicular membrane is essential for protection against the detergent properties of bile salts. The P-type ATPase ATP8B1 in the canalicular membrane translocates aminophospholipids-such as phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-from the outer to the inner leaflet of the bilayer, thereby leaving behind an outer leaflet that is depleted of PC, PS, and PE but enriched in sphingomyelin and cholesterol. The resulting lipid asymmetry renders the membrane virtually detergent insoluble and helps to maintain the functional complement of enzymes and transporters within the lipid bilayer. ATP8B1 is also present in the apical membranes of several other epithelia, including cholangiocytes and the epithelia of gallbladder, pancreas, and intestine. Mutations in ATP8B1 produce a chronic, progressive cholestatic liver disease (progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 1).

Bile is also the main pathway for elimination of cholesterol. A heterodimer composed of the "half" ABC transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8 (see Table 5-6) is located on the canalicular membrane. This transporter is responsible for the secretion of cholesterol into bile. Although the mechanism is uncertain, the ABCG5/ABCG8 complex may form a channel for cholesterol translocation or alternatively may undergo a conformational change following ATP hydrolysis, thereby flipping a cholesterol molecule into the outer membrane leaflet in a configuration favoring release into the canalicular lumen. Mutations in the genes encoding either of the two ABC monomers lead to sitosterolemia, a disorder associated with defective secretion of dietary sterols into the bile, increased intestinal absorption of plant and dietary sterols, hypercholesterolemia, and early-onset atherosclerosis.

## Hepatocytes take up proteins across their basolateral membranes by receptor-mediated endocytosis and fluid-phase endocytosis

The hepatocyte takes up macromolecules, such as plasma proteins, from the blood plasma through endocytosis, transports these molecules across the cytoplasm, and then secretes them into the bile through exocytosis. Three forms of endocytosis have been identified in the basolateral (sinusoidal) membrane: fluid-phase endocytosis (nonspecific), adsorptive endocytosis (nonspecific), and receptor-mediated endocytosis (specific).

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

A member of the ABC family (see Table 5-6), MRP2 has a broad substrate specificity but has the highest affinities for the bilirubin conjugated to monoglucuronide or diglucuronide. The affinity is also high for leukotriene $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{n}}$.

The congenital deficiency of MRP2 causes Dubin-Johnson syndrome, an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by conjugated hyperbilirubinemia (i.e., high levels of conjugated bilirubin in the blood).

## N46-6 Protein Transport by Hepatocytes

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

As noted in the text, hepatocytes take up proteins across their basolateral (i.e., sinusoidal) membranes via three forms of endocytosis. We discuss the fate of these endocytosed proteins in the next two paragraphs.

## Intracellular Transport

Once proteins move into the hepatocyte by basolateral endocytosis, they can be transported across the cytoplasm within vesicles. This process, known as transcytosis, requires microtubules and is blocked by microtubule inhibitors, such as colchicine. Vesicular carriers transport the endocytosed proteins from the basolateral to the apical (i.e., canalicular) plasma membrane, where they exit via exocytosis. These same transcytotic vesicular carriers also ferry newly synthesized apical-membrane and secretory proteins. In the liver, most proteins destined for the apical membrane are initially transported from the trans-Golgi network to the basolateral membrane and subsequently transcytosed to the apical surface. It is believed that certain signal sequences on the protein (see p. 28) designate it as an apical membrane protein and are responsible for its correct targeting. The constitutive expression, rapid transport, and slow turnover of apical proteins mean that few are in the biosynthetic pipeline at steady state. During perturbations of liver function, such as cholestasis,
the process of protein sorting is disturbed, and newly synthesized apical membrane proteins may accumulate in a subapical vesicular compartment or may be missorted to the basolateral domain.

## Apical Exocytosis

The principal pathway for secretion of high-molecular-weight proteins, whether they originate de novo from within the hepatocyte or come from the plasma, is exocytosis at the apical membrane. Exocytosis may also be used to recruit transport proteins to the plasma membrane. For example, cAMP stimulates sorting of MRP2 (multidrug resistance-associated protein 2, ABCC2) to the canalicular membrane, a process that is accompanied by increases in canalicular membrane area and that can be inhibited by nocodazole, a microtubule inhibitor. Thus, the targeting of vesicles to the apical membrane may be a highly regulated (rather than constitutive) process and may be an important determinant of organic anion excretion into bile. A similar mechanism of both exocytosis and endocytosis at the apical membrane may be involved in the cell volume-regulatory responses to hyperosmotic stress (see p. 131) and hypo-osmotic stress (see pp. 131-132).

Fluid-phase endocytosis involves the uptake of a small amount of extracellular fluid with its solutes and is a result of the constitutive process of membrane invagination and internalization (see pp. 41-42). The process is nondiscriminatory and inefficient.

Adsorptive endocytosis involves nonspecific binding of the protein to the plasma membrane before endocytosis, and it results in more efficient protein uptake.

Receptor-mediated endocytosis is quantitatively the most important mechanism for the uptake of macromolecules (see p. 42). After endocytosis, the receptor recycles to the plasma membrane, and the ligand may be excreted directly into bile by exocytosis or delivered to lysosomes for degradation. Receptor-mediated endocytosis is involved in the hepatic removal from the blood of proteins such as insulin, polymeric immunoglobulin A (IgA), asialoglycoproteins, and epidermal growth factor.

## BILE FORMATION

## The secretion of canalicular bile is active and isotonic

The formation of bile occurs in three discrete steps. First, the hepatocytes actively secrete bile into the bile canaliculi. Second, intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts not only transport this bile but also secrete into it a watery, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ rich fluid. These first two steps may produce $\sim 900 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day of so-called hepatic bile (Table 46-2). Third, between meals, approximately half the hepatic bile-perhaps $450 \mathrm{~mL} /$ dayis diverted to the gallbladder, which stores the bile and isosmotically removes salts and water. The result is that the gallbladder concentrates the key remaining solutes in bile fluid-bile salts, bilirubin, cholesterol, and lecithin-by 10 - to 20 -fold. The $500 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day of bile that reaches the duodenum through the ampulla of Vater is thus a mixture

of relatively "dilute" hepatic bile and "concentrated" gallbladder bile.

The first step in bile formation cannot be ultrafiltration because the hydrostatic pressure in the canaliculi is significantly higher than the sinusoidal perfusion pressure. This situation is in marked contrast to glomerular filtration by the kidney (see pp. 743-745), which relies predominantly on passive hydrostatic forces for producing the fluid in Bowman's space. Instead, bile formation is an active process. It is sensitive to changes in temperature and to metabolic inhibitors. Bile formation by hepatocytes requires the active, energy-dependent secretion of inorganic and organic solutes into the canalicular lumen, followed by the passive movement of water.

Canalicular bile is an isosmotic fluid. Water movement into the bile canaliculus can follow both paracellular and transcellular pathways. As far as the paracellular pathway is concerned, the movement of water through the tight junctions between hepatocytes carries with it solutes by solvent drag (see p. 467). Further down the biliary tree (i.e., ducts and gallbladder), where the pore size of paracellular junctions is significantly smaller, solvent drag is not as important. Organic solutes do not readily enter bile distal to the canaliculi.

As far as the transcellular pathway is concerned, water enters hepatocytes via aquaporin 9 (AQP9), found exclusively on the sinusoidal membrane. AQP9 also allows the passage of a wide variety of neutral solutes such as urea, glycerol, purines, and pyrimidines. The canalicular membrane expresses AQP8. Under basal conditions, AQP8 is predominantly localized to intracellular vesicles so that water permeability in the canalicular membrane is lower than that in the sinusoidal membrane and is rate limiting for transcellular water transport. However, upon cAMP stimulation, AQP8 from the intracellular pool inserts into the canalicular membrane, which substantially increased the water permeability of this membrane. With cAMP stimulation, transcellular water permeability in the hepatocyte is similar to that in the renal proximal tubule, where water flow is largely transcellular. Indeed, the transcellular pathway accounts for most of the water entering the bile canaliculus during choleresis.

## Major organic molecules in bile include bile acids, cholesterol, and phospholipids

Bile has two important functions: (1) bile provides the sole excretory route for many solutes that are not excreted by the kidney, and (2) secreted bile salts and acids are required for normal lipid digestion (see pp. 925-929) and absorption (see pp. 929-933).

Both hepatic bile and gallbladder bile are complex fluids that are isosmotic with plasma ( $\sim 300 \mathrm{mOsm}$ ) and consist of water, inorganic electrolytes, and a variety of organic solutes, including bilirubin, cholesterol, fatty acids, and phospholipid (see Table 46-2). The predominant cation in bile is $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and the major inorganic anions are $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Solutes whose presence in bile is functionally important include micelleforming bile acids, phospholipids, and IgA.

Bile acids promote dietary lipid absorption through their micelle-forming properties (see p. 929). As shown in

![bo894869338f](bo894869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-9 Synthesis of bile acids. The liver converts cholesterol to the primary bile acids-cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid-in a series of 14 reactions occurring in four different cellular organelles. Bacteria in the terminal ileum and colon may dehydroxylate bile acids, yielding the secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid and lithocholic acid. The hepatocytes conjugate most of the primary bile acids to small molecules such as glycine and taurine before secreting them into the bile. In addition, those secondary bile acids that return to the liver via the enterohepatic circulation may also be conjugated to glycine or taurine

Figure 46-9, hepatocytes synthesize the so-called primary bile acids-cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid-from cholesterol. Indeed, biliary excretion of cholesterol and conversion of cholesterol to bile acids are the principal routes of cholesterol excretion and catabolism, so that bile formation is pivotal for total-body cholesterol balance. The first step in this conversion is catalyzed by cholesterol $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), (1) N46-7 a specific cytochrome P-450 enzyme located in the SER. As we see below, secondary bile acids are the products of bacterial dehydroxylation in the terminal ileum and colon. After being absorbed and returning to the liver (enterohepatic circulation, discussed below), these secondary bile acids may also undergo conjugation. Figure 46-9 shows typical examples of conjugation reactions.

Phospholipids in bile help to solubilize cholesterol as well as diminish the cytotoxic effects of other bile acids on hepatocytes and bile duct cells. IgA inhibits bacterial growth in bile.

Excretory or waste products found in bile include cholesterol, bile pigments, trace minerals, plant sterols, lipophilic drugs and metabolites, antigen-antibody complexes, and oxidized glutathione.

Bile is also the excretory route for compounds that do not readily enter the renal glomerular filtrate, either because they are associated with proteins such as albumin or because they are associated with formed elements in blood. Although these compounds are generally lipophilic, they also include the heavy metals. Some bile acids (e.g., the trihydroxy bile acid cholic acid) are only partly bound to serum albumin and may therefore enter the glomerular filtrate. However, they are actively reabsorbed by the renal tubule. In health, bile acids are virtually absent from the urine.

Figure 46-10 Components of bile flow.

## Canalicular bile flow has a constant component driven by the secretion of small organic molecules and a variable component driven by the secretion of bile acids

Total bile flow is the sum of the bile flow from hepatocytes into the canaliculi (canalicular flow) and the additional flow from cholangiocytes into the bile ducts (ductular flow). In most species, the rate of canalicular bile secretion (i.e., milliliters per minute) increases more or less linearly with the rate of bile acid secretion (i.e., moles per minute). Canalicular bile flow is the sum of two components (Fig. 46-10): (1) a "constant" component that is independent of bile acid secretion (bile acid-independent flow) and (2) a rising component that increases linearly with bile acid secretion (bile acid-dependent flow). In humans, most of the canalicular bile flow is bile acid dependent. If we now add the ductular

# N46-7 Cholesterol $7 \alpha$-Hydroxylase 

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

As noted in the text, the first step in the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids is the hydroxylation of cholesterol at position 7 by cholesterol $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase. Bile acid levels regulate the activity of this enzyme, probably by both positive and negative feedback. Negative feedback in a cultured rat hepatocyte model occurs partly at the transcriptional level.

secretion, which is also "constant," we have the total bile flow in Figure 46-10. We discuss the canalicular secretion in the remainder of this section and ductular secretion in the following section.

Bile Acid-Independent Flow in the Canaliculi The secretion of organic compounds probably provides the major driving force for bile acid-independent flow. For example, glutathione, present in bile in high concentrations, may generate a potent osmotic driving force for canalicular bile formation. (5) N46-8

Bile Acid-Dependent Flow in the Canaliculi The negatively charged bile salts in bile are in a micellar form and are-in a sense-large polyanions. Thus, they are effectively out of solution and have a low osmotic activity coefficient. However, the positively charged counterions accompanying these micellar bile acids are still in aqueous solution and may thus represent the predominant osmotic driving force for water movement in bile acid-dependent flow. If one infuses an animal with a nonphysiological bile acid that does not form micelles or one that forms micelles only at a rather high concentration, the osmotic activity will be higher, and thus the exogenous bile acid will be more effective in producing bile acid-dependent flow. In other words, the slope of the blue bile acid-dependent line in Figure 46-10 would be steeper than for physiological bile acids.

Bile flow does not always correlate with the osmotic activity of the bile acid. In some cases, bile acids increase electrolyte and water flux by other mechanisms, such as by stimulating $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-coupled cotransport mechanisms or by modulating the activity of other solute transporters. For example, the bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid produces a substantial increase in bile flow by markedly stimulating biliary $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$excretion.

Bile acids in the lumen may also stimulate the secretion of other solutes by trapping them in the lumen. These solutes include bilirubin and other organic anions, as well as lipids such as cholesterol and phospholipids. The mixed micelles formed by the bile acids apparently sequester these other solutes, thus lowering their effective luminal concentration and favoring their entry. Therefore, excretion of cholesterol and phospholipid is negligible when bile acid output is low, but it increases and approaches maximum values as bile acid output increases.

## Secretin stimulates the cholangiocytes of ductules and ducts to secrete a watery, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich fluid

As discussed in the previous section, biliary epithelial cells, or cholangiocytes, are the second major source of the fluid in hepatic bile. Experimentally, one can isolate cholangiocytes from normal liver or from the liver of experimental animals in which ductular hyperplasia has been induced by ligating the bile duct. These cholangiocytes (Fig. 46-11) have 6 of the 13 known human aquaporins, an apical $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger AE2, and several apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, including the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; see p. 120). In a mechanism that may be similar to that in pancreatic duct cells (see Fig. 43-6), the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger, in parallel with the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$recycling,
![bo914869338f](bo914869338f.jpg)

can secrete an $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich fluid. (C) N46-9 AQP1, CFTR, and AE2 colocalize to intracellular vesicles in cholangiocytes; secretory agonists cause all three to co-redistribute to the apical membrane.

A complex network of hormones, mainly acting via cAMP, regulates cholangiocyte secretory function. Secretin receptors (see pp. 886-887) are present on the cholangiocyte basolateral membrane, a fact that explains why secretin produces a watery choleresis-that is, a bile rich in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ (i.e., alkaline) but poor in bile acids. The hormones glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP; see Fig. 13-9) have similar actions. (C) N46-10 These hormones raise [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$ and thus stimulate apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels and the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger. $\mathrm{A} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel is also present in the apical membrane. (C) N46-11

Cholangiocytes are also capable of reabsorbing fluid and electrolytes, as suggested by the adaptation that occurs after removal of the gallbladder (i.e., cholecystectomy). Bile found within the common bile duct of fasting cholecystectomized animals is similar in composition to the concentrated bile typically found in the gallbladder. Thus, the ducts have partially taken over the function of the gallbladder (see below).

The hormone somatostatin inhibits bile flow by lowering [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$, an effect opposite that of secretin. This inhibition may be caused by enhancing fluid reabsorption by bile ducts or by inhibiting ductular secretion of the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-rich fluid discussed above.

## N46-8 Contribution of Inorganic Solutes to Bile Acid-Independent Flow

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

In addition to organic solutes, inorganic solutes also contribute to bile acid-independent flow of bile. The secretion of these inorganic electrolytes occurs primarily by solvent drag (see p. 467) and passive diffusion (e.g., through canalicular $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ channels; see Fig. 46-5B). To the extent that these inorganic electrolytes enter the canalicular lumen by passive diffusion, they pull in water osmotically and thus contribute to bile acidindependent flow. However, this is not a major effect.

## N46-9 $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Secretion by Cholangiocytes

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

As noted in the text, the mechanism of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by cholangiocytes may be similar to that of secretion by pancreatic duct cells. For a discussion of the latter process, see (46-20.

In addition, cholangiocytes transport water into bile via an aquaporin water channel. Na-H exchangers are expressed on both the basolateral membrane (NHE1) and the apical membrane (NHE2) of cholangiocytes.

# N46-20 $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Secretion by the Pancreatic Duct 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The current model for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion by the pancreatic duct is very similar to that outlined in Figure 43-6. However, we can now add some important details about the apical step of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion. The $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger at the apical membrane is a member of the SLC26 family (Mount and Romero, 2004)—previously known as the SAT family—specifically, SLC26A6 (also known as CFEX). We now appreciate that SLC26A6, which is capable of exchanging several different anions (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, oxalate), is electrogenic (Jiang et al, 2002). When mediating $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange, it appears that SLC26A6 exchanges two $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ions for every $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ion. This stoichiometry would strongly favor the efflux of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$across the apical membrane of the pancreatic duct cell.

As noted in the text, the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$that enters the cell via SLC26A exits the cell via apical $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, principally CFTR. Interestingly, it appears that an interaction between the SLC26A6 protein and CFTR greatly increases the open probability of CFTR (Ko et al, 2004).

Another member of the SLC26 family—SLC26A3—also is present in the apical membrane of pancreatic duct cells. SLC26A3 is also electrogenic but has a stoichiometry opposite to that of SLCA6, two $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions for every $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This transporter would extrude $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(and take up $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ ) from the duct cell across the apical membrane. Its physiological function might be to reabsorb $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at times when the duct is not secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or to contribute to the recycling of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$when the duct is secreting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$.

## N46-10 Regulation of Cholangiocyte Secretion

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

In addition to the hormones mentioned on pages 960-961, gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) also stimulates fluid and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$secretion from cholangiocytes, but through mechanisms other than cAMP, cGMP, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Exposure of polarized cholangiocytes to ATP results in luminal secretion through activation of $\mathrm{P}_{1} \mu$ receptors on the apical membrane. Release of ATP into bile appears to serve as an autocrine or paracrine signal regulating cholangiocyte secretory function.

$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels (CaCCs) play important physiological roles. One group of CaCCs are encoded by the ANO genes (see Table 6-2, family No. 17). The bestrophins, encoded by at least four BEST genes, constitute another family of CaCCs. The molecular identity of CaCCs in the liver is unknown.

Solutes reabsorbed from bile by cholangiocytes are recycled. As shown in Figure 46-2, the intralobular bile ducts are endowed with a rich peribiliary vascular plexus that is supplied by the hepatic artery. The blood draining this plexus finds its way into the hepatic sinusoids. This plexus is analogous to the capillaries of the gut, which, via the portal vein, also find their way into the hepatic sinusoids. Thus, some solutes, such as the hydrophilic bile acid ursodeoxycholic acid, may be absorbed by the cholangiocytes from bile and returned to the hepatocytes for repeat secretion, a process that induces significant choleresis.

## The gallbladder stores bile and delivers it to the duodenum during a meal

The gallbladder is not an essential structure of bile secretion. Tonic contraction of the sphincter of Oddi facilitates gallbladder filling by maintaining a positive pressure within the common bile duct. As we noted above, up to $50 \%$ of hepatic bile-or $\sim 450 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day-is diverted to the gallbladder during fasting. The remaining $\sim 450 \mathrm{~mL} /$ day passes directly into the duodenum. Periods of gallbladder filling between meals are interrupted by brief periods of partial emptying of concentrated bile and probably aspiration of dilute hepatic bile in a process analogous to the function of a bellows.

Gallbladder emptying and filling is under feedback control. During feeding, CCK secreted by duodenal I cells (see Table 41-1) causes gallbladder contraction and the release of bile into the duodenum, where the bile promotes fat digestion and suppresses further CCK secretion. On reaching the ileum, bile acids induce synthesis of fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19); FGF19, after transit in portal blood, causes relaxation of gallbladder smooth muscle, which allows gallbladder refilling. Thus, CCK and FGF19 control the periodicity of gallbladder emptying and filling.

During the interdigestive period, the gallbladder concentrates bile acids-and certain other components of bile-up to 10 - or even 20 -fold within the gallbladder lumen because they are left behind during the isotonic reabsorption of NaCl and $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ by the leaky gallbladder epithelium (Fig. 46-12). The apical step of NaCl uptake and transport is electroneutral and is mediated by parallel $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$
![bo924869338f](bo924869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-12 Isotonic fluid reabsorption by the gallbladder epithelium.
exchangers. At the basolateral membrane, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$exits through the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, whereas $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$most likely exits by $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels. Both water and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$move passively from lumen to blood through the tight junctions. Water can also move through the cell via AQP1 (expressed on apical and basolateral membranes) and AQP8 (found only apically). The net transport is isotonic, which leaves behind gallbladder bile that is also isotonic but has a higher concentration of bile salts, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. Net fluid and electrolyte transport across the gallbladder epithelium is under hormonal regulation. Both VIP (released from neurons innervating the gallbladder) and serotonin inhibit net fluid and electrolyte absorption. Conversely, $\alpha$-adrenergic blockade of neuronal VIP release increases fluid absorption.

Although the gallbladder reabsorbs NaCl by parallel $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange at the apical membrane, $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchange outstrips $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange; the end result is net secretion of $\mathbf{H}^{+}$ions. This action neutralizes the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and acidifies the bile. The $\mathrm{H}^{+}$secreted by the gallbladder protonates the intraluminal contents. This action greatly increases the solubility of calcium salts in bile and reduces the likelihood of calcium salt precipitation and gallstone formation. Common "pigment gallstones" contain one or more of several calcium salts, including carbonate, bilirubinate, phosphate, and fatty acids. The solubility of each of these compounds is significantly increased by the acidification of bile.

Mucus secretion by gallbladder epithelial cells results in the formation of a polymeric gel that protects the apical surface of the gallbladder epithelium from the potentially toxic effects of bile salts. However, excessive mucin synthesis can be deleterious. For example, in animal models of cholesterol cholelithiasis (i.e., formation of gallstones made of cholesterol), a marked increase in mucin release precedes crystal and stone formation.

## The relative tones of the gallbladder and sphincter of Oddi determine whether bile flows from the common hepatic duct into the gallbladder or into the duodenum

Bile exiting the liver and flowing down the common hepatic duct reaches a bifurcation that permits flow either into the cystic duct and then into the gallbladder or into the common bile duct, through the sphincter of Oddi, and into the duodenum (see Fig. 46-4). The extent to which bile takes either path depends on the relative resistances of the two pathways.

The sphincter of Oddi-which also controls the flow of pancreatic secretions into the duodenum-corresponds functionally to a short ( 4 - to $6-\mathrm{mm}$ ) zone within the wall of the duodenum. The basal pressure within the lumen of the duct at the level of the sphincter is 5 to 10 mm Hg . The pressure in the lumen of the resting common bile duct is also 5 to 10 mm Hg , compared with a pressure of $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ inside the duodenum.

The basal contraction of the sphincter prevents reflux of the duodenal contents into the common bile duct. In its basal state, the sphincter exhibits high-pressure, phasic contractions several times per minute. These contractions are primarily peristaltic and directed in antegrade fashion to provide a motive force toward the duodenum. Thus, the

## BOX 46-2 Cholestasis

THe term cholestasis refers to the suppression of bile secretion. Biliary constituents may therefore be retained within the hepatocyte and regurgitated into the systemic circulation. Cholestasis causes three major groups of negative effects: first, regurgitation of bile components (bile acids, bilirubin) into the systemic circulation gives rise to the symptoms of jaundice and pruritus (itching). Second, cholestasis damages hepatocytes, as evidenced by the release of clinically important liver enzymes (e.g., alkaline phosphatase) into the plasma. Third, because the bile acids do not arrive in the duodenum, lipid digestion and absorption may be impaired.

Many acute and chronic liver diseases produce cholestasis by mechanically obstructing the extrahepatic bile ducts or by impairing bile flow at the level of the hepatocytes or intrahepatic bile ducts. The mechanisms underlying the obstructive and functional forms of cholestasis are complex and have not been completely defined. Experimental modeling of cholestasis has produced multiple abnormalities: (1) altered plasma-membrane composition and fluidity; (2) inhibition of membrane proteins, including the Na-K pump and aquaporins; (3) reduced expression of genes encoding transporters for bile acids and other organic anions; (4) altered expression of nuclear receptors and associated epigenetic modifications that regulate transporters; (5) increased permeability of the paracellular pathway, with backdiffusion of biliary solutes into the plasma; (6) altered function of microfilaments, with decreased contractions of bile canaliculi; and (7) loss of the polarized distribution of some plasma-membrane proteins. Cholestatic conditions, such as bile duct obstruction, markedly increase the basolateral expression of MRP4 and MRP6 as well as OSTα-OST $\beta$-which normally are expressed only minimally. The induction of these transporters allows the efflux of bile acids and other cholephilic anions from the hepatocyte into sinusoidal blood.
sphincter of Oddi acts principally as an adjustable occluding mechanism and a regulator of bile flow.

Both hormonal and cholinergic mechanisms appear to be involved in gallbladder emptying. Dietary lipid stimulates the release of CCK from duodenal I cells (see pp. 889-890). This CCK not only stimulates pancreatic secretion but also causes smooth-muscle contraction and evacuation of the gallbladder. The coordinated response to CCK also includes relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which enhances bile flow into the duodenum (Box 46-2).

## ENTEROHEPATIC CIRCULATION OF BILE ACIDS

## The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is a loop consisting of secretion by the liver, reabsorption by the intestine, and return to the liver in portal blood for repeat secretion into bile

Bile acids are important for promoting the absorption of dietary lipids in the intestine. The quantity of bile acid that the liver normally secretes in a day varies with the number of meals and the fat content of these meals, but it typically ranges between 12 and 36 g . The liver's basal rate of synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol (see Fig. 46-9) is only
$\sim 600 \mathrm{mg} /$ day in healthy humans, sufficient to replace the equivalent losses of bile acid in the feces. Obviously, the gastrointestinal tract must have an extremely efficient mechanism for recycling the bile acids secreted by the liver (Fig. 46-13). This recycling, known as the enterohepatic circulation, occurs as the terminal ileum and colon reabsorb bile acids and return them to the liver in the portal blood. The total pool of bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract is $\sim 3 \mathrm{~g}$. This pool must recirculate $\sim 4$ to 12 times per day, or as many as 5 or more times for a single fat-rich meal. If reabsorption of bile acids is defective, as can happen after resection of the ileum, de novo synthesis of bile acids by the liver can be as high as 4 to $6 \mathrm{~g} /$ day.

## Efficient intestinal conservation of bile acids depends on active apical absorption in the terminal ileum and passive absorption throughout the intestinal tract

Most of the bile secreted into the duodenum is in the conjugated form. Very little of these bile salts is reabsorbed into the intestinal tract until they reach the terminal ileum, an arrangement that allows the bile salts to remain at high levels throughout most of the small intestine, where they can participate in lipid digestion (see pp. 925-929) and absorption (see pp. 929-933). However, the enterohepatic circulation must eventually reclaim $95 \%$ or more of these secreted bile salts. Some of the absorption of bile acids by the intestines is passive and occurs along the entire small intestine and colon. Nevertheless, the major component of bile acid absorption is active and occurs only in the terminal ileum (see Fig. 46-13).

Passive absorption of bile acids occurs along the entire small intestine and colon (see Fig. 46-13), but it is less intensive than active absorption. The mechanism of bile acid uptake across the apical membrane may consist of either ionic or nonionic diffusion (see pp. 784-785). Nonionic diffusion-or passive diffusion of the protonated or neutral form of the bile acid-is 10 -fold greater than ionic diffusion. The extent of nonionic diffusion for a given bile acid depends on the concentration of its neutral, protonated form, which is maximized when the luminal pH is low and the pK of the bile acid is high. At the normal intestinal pH of 5.5 to 6.5 , few of the taurine-conjugated bile salts are protonated, a small amount of the glycine-conjugated bile salts are protonated, and $\sim 50 \%$ of unconjugated bile acids are protonated. Thus, the unconjugated bile acids are in the best position to be reabsorbed by nonionic diffusion, followed by the glycineconjugated bile acids and then finally by the taurineconjugated bile acids. Among these unconjugated bile acids, more lipophilic bile acids, such as chenodeoxycholate and deoxycholate, diffuse more readily through the apical membrane than do hydrophilic bile acids such as cholic acid. Nonionic diffusion also depends on the total concentration of the bile acid (i.e., neutral plus charged form), which, in turn, depends on the maximum solubilizing capacity of bilesalt micelles for that bile acid.

Active absorption of bile acids in the intestine is restricted to the terminal ileum (see Fig. 46-13). This active process preferentially absorbs the negatively charged conjugated bile salts-the form not well absorbed by the passive

![bo934869338f](bo934869338f.jpg)

Figure 46-13 Enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. The bile acids that the liver delivers to the duodenum in the bile are primarily conjugated to taurine or glycine (BA-Z'), and these conjugates enter the portal blood in the terminal ileum to return to the liver. Some unconjugated bile acids and secondary bile acids also return to the hepatocyte for resecretion.
mechanisms. Active uptake of bile salts involves saturation kinetics, competitive inhibition, and a requirement for $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent transporter responsible for the apical step of active absorption is known as the apical Na/bile-salt transporter (ASBT or SLC10A2), a close relative of the hepatocyte transporter NTCP (see Fig. 46-5C). After bile salts enter ileal enterocytes across the apical membrane, they exit across the basolateral membrane via the heteromeric organic solute transporter $\mathbf{O S T} \alpha-\mathbf{O S T} \beta$.

Because the most polar bile salts are poorly absorbed by nonionic diffusion, it is not surprising that the ASBT in the apical membrane of the enterocytes of the terminal ileum has the highest affinity and maximal transport rates for these salts. For example, ASBT is primarily responsible
for absorbing the ionized, taurine-conjugated bile salts in the ileum. Conversely, ASBT in the ileum is relatively poor at absorbing the more lipophilic bile acids, which tend to be absorbed passively in the upper intestine.

On their entry into portal blood, the bile acids are predominantly bound to albumin and, to a lesser extent, lipoproteins. The liver removes or clears these bile acids from portal blood by the transport mechanisms outlined above in Figure 46-5C. Hepatic clearance of bile acids is often expressed as the percentage of bile acids removed during a single pass through the liver. The hepatic extraction of bile acids is related to bile acid structure and the degree of albumin binding. It is greatest for hydrophilic bile acids and lowest for protein-bound, hydrophobic bile acids.

The small fraction of bile acids that escapes active or passive absorption in the small intestine is subject to bacterial modification in the colon. This bacterial modification takes two forms. First, the bacteria deconjugate the bile. Second, the bacteria perform a $7 \alpha$-dehydroxylation reaction with the formation of secondary bile acids. These secondary bile acids include deoxycholate and lithocholate (see Fig. 46-9). The deconjugated secondary bile acids may then be either absorbed passively in the colon or excreted in the feces; their fate depends on their physicochemical properties and their binding to luminal contents. Up to one third of the deoxycholate formed in the colon may be reabsorbed by nonionic diffusion. Lithocholate, which is relatively insoluble, is absorbed to a much lesser extent. The secondary bile acids formed by colonic bacteria and recycled back to the liver may undergo biotransformation through conjugation to glycine and taurine.

Thus, the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is driven by two mechanical pumps: (1) the motor activity of the gallbladder, and (2) peristalsis of the intestines to propel the bile acids to the terminal ileum and colon. It is also driven by two chemical pumps: (1) energy-dependent transporters located in the terminal ileum, and (2) energy-dependent transporters in the hepatocyte.

The bile acid receptor FXR, a member of the nuclear receptor family (see Table 3-6), controls multiple components of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Primary bile acids are potent agonists of FXR, which transcriptionally regulates several genes involved in bile acid homeostasis, producing negative feedback by four mechanisms:

1. FXR in hepatocytes induces expression of a transcription factor called the small heterodimer partner (SHP); SHP, in turn, inhibits another nuclear receptor, the liver receptor homolog 1 (LRH-1), which is required for CYP7A1 expression. The result is that FXR inhibits the expression of cholesterol $7 \alpha$-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) the rate-limiting enzyme for bile acid synthesis (see Fig. 46-9).
2. FXR in the ileum increases the synthesis and secretion into portal blood of FGF19, which then activates the FGF receptor 4 signaling pathway in the liver, repressing CYP7A1.
3. FXR in hepatocytes upregulates BSEP (which increases bile acid secretion; see Fig. 46-5C) and downregulates NTCP (which decreases bile acid uptake; see Fig. 46-5C) by SHP-dependent mechanisms. The net result is a reduction of intracellular bile acids.
4. FXR in the ileum, via SHP, downregulates ASBT (see Fig. 46-13, inset), thereby reducing bile acid uptake. FXR also induces the expression of basolateral $\operatorname{OST} \alpha-\mathrm{OST} \beta$, thereby increasing bile acid efflux. The net result is a reduction of intracellular bile acids.

Thus, FXR coordinates bile acid synthesis and transport by the liver and intestine. The bile acid signaling network also includes the G protein-coupled receptor TGR5, which is highly expressed in the apical membrane and primary cilium of cholangiocytes and gallbladder epithelial cells, but minimally in hepatocytes. Activation of TGR5 by bile acids in the biliary tract leads to a rise in [cAMP]i, which causes $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion to increase (Box 46-3).

## BOX 46-3 Gallstones

During hemolytic anemias, small, dark pigment gallstones may form secondary to the excess production and excretion of bilirubin. However, most gallstones ( $\sim 80 \%$ ) consist mainly of cholesterol. Thus, cholelithiasis is largely a disturbance of bile secretion and cholesterol elimination. When cholesterol and phospholipids are secreted together into the bile, they form unilamellar bilayered vesicles. These vesicles become incorporated into mixed micelles that form because of the amphiphilic properties of bile acids. Micellation allows cholesterol to remain in solution in its passage through the biliary tree. However, if the concentration of bile acids is insufficient to maintain all the cholesterol in the form of mixed micelles, the excess cholesterol is left behind as vesicles in the aqueous phase. These cholesterol-enriched vesicles are relatively unstable and are prone to aggregate and form large multilamellar vesicles, from which cholesterol crystals nucleate. Growth of crystals may result in the formation of gallstones. An excess of biliary cholesterol in relation to the amount of phospholipids and bile acids can result from hypersecretion of cholesterol, inadequate secretion of bile acids, or both. Cholelithiasis may be further promoted by other factors, such as gallbladder mucin and other nonmucous glycoproteins, as well as by stasis of bile in the gallbladder. Polymorphisms in the hepatic cholesterol transporter ABCG5/G8 and the bilirubin-conjugating enzyme UGT1A1 (see p. 955) contribute to the formation of gallstones in humans.

## THE LIVER AS A METABOLIC ORGAN

The liver is a metabolically active and highly aerobic organ. It receives $\sim 28 \%$ of the total blood flow and extracts $\sim 20 \%$ of the oxygen used by the body. The liver is responsible for the synthesis and degradation of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. The small molecules that are products of digestion are efficiently sorted in the liver for metabolism, storage, or distribution to extrahepatic tissues for energy. The liver provides energy to other tissues mainly by exporting two substrates that are critical for oxidization in the peripheral tissues, glucose and ketone bodies (e.g., acetoacetate).

## The liver can serve as either a source or a sink for glucose

The liver is one of the key organs that maintain blood glucose concentrations within a narrow range, in a dynamic process involving endogenous glucose production and glucose utilization. The fasting blood [glucose] is normally 4 to 5 mM . Between meals, when levels of insulin are relatively low (see p. 1036) and levels of glucagon are high (see p. 1052), the liver serves as a source of plasma glucose, both by synthesizing glucose and by generating it from the breakdown of glycogen. The de novo synthesis of glucose from lactate, pyruvate, and amino acids-gluconeogenesis (see p. 1176)is one of the liver's most important functions; it is essential for maintaining a normal plasma concentration of glucose, which is the primary energy source for most tissues.

The second way in which the liver delivers glucose to blood plasma is by glycogenolysis (see p. 1182). Stored glycogen may account for as much as $7 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the total

weight of the liver. Glycogenolysis in the liver yields glucose as its major product, whereas glycogen breakdown in muscle produces lactic acid (see Fig. 58-9).

After a meal, when levels of insulin are relatively high, the liver does just the opposite: it acts as a sink for glucose by taking it up from the portal blood and either breaking it down to pyruvate or using it to synthesize glycogen (see Fig. 51-8 and pp. 1179-1181). Glucose oxidation has two phases. In the anaerobic phase, glucose is broken down to pyruvic acid (glycolysis). In the aerobic phase, pyruvic acid is completely oxidized to $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ through the citric acid cycle.

The liver also consumes glucose by using it for glycogen synthesis. Carbohydrate that is not stored as glycogen or oxidized is metabolized to fat.

All the aforementioned processes are regulated by hormones such as insulin (see Fig. 51-8) and glucagon (see Fig. 51-12), which enable rapid responses to changes in the metabolic requirements of the body.

## The liver synthesizes a variety of important plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, coagulation factors, and carriage proteins) and metabolizes dietary amino acids

Protein Synthesis One of the major functions of the liver is to produce a wide array of proteins for export to the blood plasma (Table 46-3). These products include major plasma proteins that are important for maintaining the colloid osmotic pressure of plasma (see p. 470). Other products include factors involved in hemostasis (blood clotting) and fibrinolysis (breakdown of blood clots), carriage proteins that bind and transport hormones and other substances in the blood, prohormones, and lipoproteins (Table 46-4). The liver synthesizes plasma proteins at a maximum rate of 15 to $50 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. (4) N46-12

Amino-Acid Uptake A major role of the liver is to take up and metabolize dietary amino acids that are absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract (see p. 923) and are transported to the liver in portal blood. These amino acids are taken up by both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-dependent and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-independent transporters that are identical to some of the amino-acid transporters in the kidney, small intestine, and other tissues (see Table 36-1). An unusual feature of the liver is that, with few exceptions, the same amino-acid transporter may be located on both the basolateral and apical membranes. For example, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}-$ dependent glutamate uptake by the excitatory amino-acid transporters SLC1A1 (EAAT3) and SLC1A2 (EAAT2) occurs primarily at the apical membrane, but dexamethasone (corticosteroid) treatment can induce their expression at the basolateral membrane. In general, hepatic amino-acid transporters are highly regulated at the transcriptional and posttranslational levels. (5) N46-13

Amino-Acid Metabolism Under physiological conditions, total and individual plasma concentrations of amino acids are tightly regulated. The liver controls the availability of amino acids in the systemic blood, activating ureagenesis after a high-protein meal and repressing it during fasting or low protein intake. Unlike glucose, which can be stored, amino acids must either be used immediately (e.g., for the

synthesis of proteins) or broken down. The breakdown of $\alpha$-amino acids occurs by deamination to $\alpha$-keto acids and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(Fig. 46-14). The $\alpha$-keto acids ("carbon skeleton"), depending on the structure of the parent amino acid, are metabolized to pyruvate, various intermediates of the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 58-11), acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), or acetoacetyl CoA. The liver detoxifies $\sim 95 \%$ of the $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$through a series of reactions known as the urea cycle (see Fig. 46-14); the liver can also use $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$-together with glutamate-to generate glutamine. (5) N46-14 Individual deficiencies in each of the enzymes involved in the urea cycle have been described and result in life-threatening hyperammonemia. The urea generated by the urea cycle exits the hepatocyte via a urea channel, which is, in fact, AQP9. The urea then enters the blood and is ultimately excreted by the kidneys (see pp. 770-772). The glutamine synthesized by the liver also enters the blood. Some of this glutamine is metabolized by the kidney to yield glutamate and $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$, which is exported in the urine (see pp. 829-831).

## N46-12 Synthesis of Plasma Proteins by the Liver

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

The synthesis of the hepatic proteins for secretion into the blood plasma occurs via the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35). The synthesis begins in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER). Nearly all proteins secreted by the liver are glycosylated. N -linked glycosylation occurs in the RER (see p. 32), and further remodeling occurs in the Golgi (see pp. 37-38). O-linked glycosylation also occurs in the Golgi (see pp. 38-39). The ER can also conjugate proteins with lipid.

# N46-14 Hepatic Detoxification of $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$by Formation of Glutamine 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Each day, as part of protein catabolism, the liver detoxifies $\sim 940 \mathrm{mmol}$ of amino groups that are derived from the breakdown of amino acids. The liver detoxifies $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$by converting it to urea ( $95 \%$ of the total) and glutamine (the remaining 5\%). Both products leave the liver and reach the kidney, which disposes of them-directly or indirectly-in the urine.

As indicated in Figure 39-6, the liver consumes $\sim 40 \mathrm{mmol}$ of these amino groups in the reaction

$$
\text { Glutamate }+\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+} \rightarrow \text { Glutamine }+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad(\mathrm{NE} 46-1)
$$

Glutamine is the most prevalent amino acid in the body. The liver detoxifies the remainder via the urea cycle.

The enzyme required for the conversion in Equation NE 46-1 is glutamine synthetase (see p. 290). In the liver, this enzyme is restricted to the last one or two hepatocytes contiguous with the hepatic venule (zone III; see Fig. 46-3). This strict localization is thought to play an important role in glutamine metabolism. The uptake of an individual amino acid into the hepatocyte may represent the rate-limiting step in its own metabolism and may therefore be an important target for regulation. This type of regulation of uptake occurs for alanine, a critical substrate of gluconeogenesis, and also for glutamine.

Figure 46-14 Amino-acid metabolism and urea formation in hepatocytes. When a hepatocyte takes up an $\alpha$-amino acid, it either must use it immediately in protein synthesis or deaminate it. The deamination reaction transfers the amino group of the $\alpha$-amino acid to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, yielding glutamate and the corresponding $\alpha$-keto acid. Depending on the backbone of the $\alpha$-keto acid, it may be metabolized into acetoacetyl CoA, acetyl CoA, pyruvate, or a variety of citric acid cycle intermediates. The $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$that results from the regeneration of the $\alpha$-ketoglutarate is consumed in the urea cycle. The other amino group of the urea is derived from the amino group of aspartate. The $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ moiety of urea is derived from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The liver then exports the urea, which exits the hepatocyte via AQP9. $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$, oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $\mathrm{NADH}_{2}$ reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, inorganic phosphate; UT-B, urea transporter B. N46-19

The liver is also the main site for the synthesis and secretion of glutathione. GSH is critical for detoxification (in conjugation reactions in the liver) and for protection against oxidative stress in multiple organs. Thus, erythrocytes that have low levels of GSH are more prone to hemolysis. Because $>90 \%$ of the GSH in the circulation is synthesized in the liver, GSH efflux across the basolateral membrane from the hepatocyte to the sinusoid is important. Bidirectional transport of glutathione across the basolateral membrane may occur in part by one of the OATPs as well as MRP4 by cotransport with bile acids. In addition, MRP2 exports some conjugated GSH across the canalicular membrane into bile, as stated above, and an unidentified
transporter can similarly export smaller amounts of unconjugated GSH.

## The liver obtains dietary triacylglycerols and cholesterol by taking up remnant chylomicrons via receptor-mediated endocytosis

As discussed beginning on pages 929-933, enterocytes in the small intestine process fatty acids consumed as dietary triacylglycerols and secrete them into the lymph primarily in the form of extremely large proteolipid aggregates called chylomicrons (Fig. 46-15). These chylomicrons-made up of triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and several

## Contributed by Alisha Bouzaher

NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$are, respectively, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and their close analogs are NADPH and NADP ${ }^{+}$, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The coenzymes NADH and NADPH each consist of two nucleotides joined at their phosphate groups by a phosphoanhydride bond. NADPH is structurally distinguishable from NADH by the additional phosphate group residing on the ribose ring of the nucleotide, which allows enzymes to preferentially interact with either molecule.

Total concentrations of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}\left(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\right)$ are higher in the cell by $\sim 10$-fold compared to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}\left(10^{-6} \mathrm{M}\right)$. Ratios of the oxidized and reduced forms of these coenzymes offer perspective into the metabolic activity of the cell. The high $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}$ ratio favors the transfer of a hydride from a substrate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH, the reduced form of the molecule
and oxidizing agent. Therefore, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is highly prevalent within catabolic reaction pathways where reducing equivalents (carbohydrate, fats, and proteins) transfer protons and electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. NADH acts as an energy carrier, transferring electrons from one reaction to another. Conversely, the NADP ${ }^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}$ ratio is low, favoring the transfer of a hydride to a substrate oxidizing NADPH to NADP+ ${ }^{+}$. Thus, NADPH is utilized as a reducing agent within anabolic reactions, particularly the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

apolipoproteins (see Table 46-4)—are synthesized in the intestine and pass from the lymph to the blood via the thoracic duct. As discussed on page 1182, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on the walls of the capillary endothelium in adipose tissue and muscle then partially digests the triacylglycerols in these chylomicrons. The results of this digestion are glycerol, fatty acids, and smaller or "remnant" chylomicrons, which are triacylglycerol depleted and thus enriched in cholesterol. The glycerol and fatty acids generated by LPL enter adipocytes and muscle cells. The cholesterol-rich remnant chylomicrons, conversely, remain in the blood and make their way to the liver, where they enter hepatocytes by basolateral receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42) involving multiple endocytic receptors, primarily the cellsurface heparan sulfate proteoglycan syndecan-1, other heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and low-density lipoproteinrelated receptors. The binding of apolipoprotein E on the surface of chylomicron remnants promotes efficient clearance of apolipoprotein E-containing lipoprotein remnants. After entry, the chylomicron remnants undergo degradation in lysosomes. Thus, chylomicrons transport dietary triacylglycerols to adipose tissue and muscle, whereas their remnants transport dietary triglycerides and cholesterol to hepatocytes.

The hepatocyte can also take up across its basolateral membrane the long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) (5) N46-15 liberated by LPL but not used by other tissues. Although LCFAs can diffuse rapidly across artificial phospholipid bilayers, it is clear that LCFA integral or membraneassociated proteins can mediate LCFA uptake by a wide variety of mammalian cells. In the liver, three proteins participate in fatty-acid uptake:

1. Fatty-acid translocase (FAT or CD36; see p. 930). FAT is an $88-\mathrm{kDa}$ membrane protein that takes up modified forms of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and fatty acids from circulation. The basal expression of FAT in hepatocytes is low but is induced significantly by a highfat diet or by the activation of nuclear receptors (see Table 3-6), including SXR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ (PPAR $\gamma$ ), and LXR. FAT is also expressed in Kupffer cells and hepatic stellate cells.
2. Fatty-acid transport protein 5 (FATP5 or SLC27A5). FATP5 is exclusively expressed in the liver, where it localizes to the basolateral plasma membrane and accounts for $\sim 50 \%$ of fatty-acid uptake by hepatocytes.
3. Liver-type fatty acid-binding protein 1 (FABP1). FABP1 is a cytosolic protein.

To derive energy from the neutral fats in the remnant chylomicrons, hepatocytes must first split the triacylglycerols into glycerol and fatty acids. The fatty acids thus derived from remnant chylomicrons, as well as those that enter the hepatocyte directly, mainly undergo $\beta$-oxidation in mitochondria (see pp. 1183-1185). (5) N46-16

The acetyl CoA derived from $\beta$-oxidation can enter the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185), where it is oxidized to produce large amounts of energy. The acetyl CoA that is not used by the liver is converted by the condensation of two molecules of acetyl CoA to yield acetoacetic acid. The liver is the only organ that produces acetoacetate for metabolism by muscle, brain, and kidney, but it does not use this substrate for its own energy needs. In fasting states or in poorly controlled diabetes, in which the supply of acetyl CoA is in excess, the acetyl CoA is diverted to produce acetoacetate, which in turn can yield $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetone. Together, acetoacetate, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone are referred to as ketone bodies. Another fate of fatty acids in the liver is that they can be re-esterified to glycerol, with the formation of triacylglycerols that can either be stored or exported as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs) and released into the circulation for use by peripheral tissues.

## Cholesterol, synthesized primarily in the liver, is an important component of cell membranes and serves as a precursor for bile acids and steroid hormones

The body's major pools of cholesterol include the cholesterol and cholesterol derivatives in bile, cholesterol in membranes, cholesterol carried as lipoproteins in blood (see Table 46-4), and cholesterol-rich tissues. Cholesterol is present in membranes and bile mainly as free cholesterol. In plasma and in some tissues, cholesterol is esterified with LCFAs. The major sources of cholesterol are dietary uptake of cholesterol and de novo synthesis of cholesterol by various cells (Table 46-5). The major fates of cholesterol are secretion into bile, excretion in the feces when intestinal cells are sloughed, sloughing of skin, and synthesis of steroid hormones. However, in mammals, the most important route for the elimination of cholesterol is the hepatic conversion of cholesterol into bile acids. In the steady state, the liver must excrete an amount

of sterol (as cholesterol and bile acids) that equals the amount of cholesterol that is synthesized in the various organs and absorbed from the diet.

The liver is the major organ for controlling cholesterol metabolism (see Fig. 46-15). The liver obtains cholesterol from three major sources: (1) The intestine packages dietary cholesterol as chylomicrons, which travel via the lymph to blood vessels in adipocytes and muscle, where LPL hydrolyzes triacylglycerols to fatty acids and glycerol. The resultant cholesterol-enriched remnant chylomicrons are then delivered as cholesterol to the liver. (2) The liver synthesizes cholesterol de novo. (3) The liver takes up cholesterol in the guise of LDL. In contrast, the liver exports cholesterol in two major ways: (1) The liver uses cholesterol to synthesize bile acids and also includes cholesterol and cholesteryl esters in the bile. (2) The liver also exports cholesterol to the blood in the form of VLDLs.

Synthesis of Cholesterol The de novo synthesis of cholesterol occurs in many extrahepatic tissues, as well as in the intestine and liver. The synthesis of cholesterol proceeds from acetyl CoA in a multistep process that takes place in the SER and cytosol (Fig. 46-16). The hepatic synthesis of cholesterol is inhibited by dietary cholesterol and by fasting and is increased with bile drainage (fistula) and bile duct obstruction. The rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis is the conversion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase, the level of which is decreased-in typical negative-feedback fashion-by cholesterol levels in the cell (Box 46-4). The most potent cholesterol-lowering agents that are clinically available today-the "statins"-are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. (C) N46-17

## N46-17 Treatment of Hyperlipidemia

## Contributed by Fred Suchy

Several approaches are available to treat hyperlipidemia in patients. These approaches include the following:

1. Bile acid sequestrants, which enhance the excretion of sterols in the feces.
2. Nicotinic acid (e.g., niacin), which decreases the production of VLDL cholesterol.
3. Fibric-acid derivatives (e.g., clofibrate), which decrease the production of VLDL cholesterol.
4. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e., the "statins"), which decrease cholesterol synthesis.

HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is a 97-kDa enzyme intrinsic to the ER. The protein is anchored in the ER by a 339-amino-acid domain that spans the membrane eight times and is required for activity of the protein. In the short term, decreased levels of [ATP], lead to a phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase, which reduces the activity of the enzyme and thereby presumably preserves energy stores in the cell.

Far more important than the short-term regulation of HMG-CoA reductase is the long-term control of the amount of the enzyme, which can increase as much as 200 -fold. The
amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein increases after cells are depleted of mevalonate or when the demand for mevalonatederived metabolites is increased. HMG-CoA reductase activity is upregulated by a combination of enhanced gene transcription, increased mRNA translation, and increased stability of the enzyme. These changes are reversed by the addition of cholesterol or mevalonate to the cells. The transmembrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase may serve as a receptor for the posttranslational regulatory effects of sterols.

Sterol repression of HMG-CoA reductase gene expressionas well as the expression of LDL and HMG-CoA synthase genes-is mediated by specific transcription factors (i.e., proteins) that bind to specific DNA sequence elements within the $5^{\prime}$ upstream region of target genes. The DNA-binding proteins are called sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs; see pp. 87-88); they are membrane-bound basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional activators (see p. 83 and Fig. 4-9C). The DNA to which these transcription factors bind are called sterol regulatory elements (such as SRE-1). The binding of SREBPs to SREs controls genes involved in the synthesis and receptormediated uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids.

# BOX 46-4 Control of Cholesterol Synthesis 

Aseries of 29 enzymatic reactions (Diwan, 1998-2008) converts acetyl CoA to cholesterol (see Fig. 46-16). Biosynthetic pathways, as well as uptake pathways for precursors, are under tight negative-feedback control. HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, is a 97-kDa enzyme intrinsic to the ER. The protein is anchored in the ER by a 339-amino-acid domain that spans the membrane eight times and is required for activity of the protein. In the short term, decreased intracellular levels of ATP-via AMP kinase (AMPK; see pp. 1220-1222)-lead to phosphorylation of HMGCoA reductase, which reduces the activity of the enzyme and thereby presumably preserves energy stores in the cell.

Far more important is the long-term control of the amount of HMG-CoA reductase, which can increase as much as 200 -fold. The amount of HMG-CoA reductase protein increases after cells are depleted of mevalonate or when the demand for mevalonatederived metabolites rises. HMG-CoA reductase activity is upregulated by a combination of enhanced gene transcription, increased mRNA translation, and increased stability of the enzyme. These changes are reversed by the addition of the sterol cholesterol or of mevalonate to the cells. The transmembrane domain of

HMG-CoA reductase may serve as a receptor for the regulatory effects of sterols.

The repression by sterols of the genes encoding HMG-CoA reductase-as well as HMG-CoA synthase and the LDL receptor-is mediated by specific transcription factors and specific sequence elements within the $5^{\prime}$ upstream region to which the transcription factors bind. The transcription factors, which belong to a family known as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs; see pp. 87-88), are central to feedback control of cholesterol homeostasis. These SREBPs are membrane-bound basic helix-loop-helix transcriptional activators (see p. 83) that control genes involved in the synthesis and receptor-mediated uptake of cholesterol and fatty acids. SREBP-1 is most abundant in the liver, whereas SREBP-2 is expressed ubiquitously. However, it is SREBP-2 that regulates most genes that encode enzymes of cholesterol biosynthesis.

## The liver is the central organ for cholesterol homeostasis and for the synthesis and degradation of LDL

The liver is the hub of an exogenous loop in which the liver takes up dietary cholesterol as remnant chylomicrons and exports cholesterol and cholesterol metabolites into bile. The liver is also the hub of an of endogenous loop in which the liver exports cholesterol and other lipids as VLDLs and takes them up from the blood as LDLs. Table 46-4 summarizes the properties of these lipoproteins, as well as of two others: the intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs) and the highdensity lipoproteins (HDLs). As we move from left to right in Table 46-4, the size of the particles decreases, the density increases (because the fractional mass of protein increases), the fractional amount of triacylglycerols decreases, and the fractional amount of phospholipids increases.

Regardless of the source of the cholesterol, the liver can package cholesterol along with other lipids and apolipoproteins as VLDLs-the liver's transit system for exporting endogenous triacylglycerols, phospholipids, cholesterol, and cholesteryl esters. The VLDLs are large-and therefore less dense-when the availability of triacylglycerols is high (e.g., obesity, diabetes), but they are small when triacylglycerol availability is low. VLDLs enter the bloodstream from the liver (see Fig. 46-15) and eventually make their way to the blood vessels of adipose tissue and muscle, where the same LPL that degrades chylomicrons degrades the VLDLs on the luminal surface of blood vessel endothelial cells. In the process, fatty acids are released to the tissues. Thus, VLDLs act as lipid shuttles that transport endogenous triacylglycerols to adipose tissue for storage as fat or to muscle for immediate use. As a result of the LPL activity, the large, buoyant VLDLs rapidly shrink to become the smaller IDLs and the even smaller LDLs. The half-life of VLDLs is less than an hour. In plasma, only minute amounts of IDLs are present.

Both the liver and extrahepatic tissue can take up LDLsand to a lesser extent, IDLs-by the process of receptormediated endocytosis (see p. 42). LDLs are the major carriers of cholesterol in plasma. The half-life of LDLs is 2 to 3 days. Of course, uptake of LDL by the liver is a major pathway of cholesterol input to the liver. The liver degrades $\sim 40 \%$ to $60 \%$ of LDLs, and no other tissue takes up more than $\sim 10 \%$. LDL uptake by other tissues provides a mechanism for the delivery of cholesterol that can be used for the synthesis of cell membranes and steroid hormones or for storage as cholesteryl ester droplets.

The other major player in cholesterol metabolism is HDL, which is composed of cholesterol, phospholipids, triacylglycerols, and apolipoproteins (see Table 46-4). The two major apolipoproteins of HDLs, A-I and A-II, are made by the intestines as part of chylomicrons, as well as by the liver. As LPL digests VLDLs on endothelial cells, some excess surface material (i.e., cholesterol and phospholipids) of these rapidly shrinking particles is transferred to the HDLs. In peripheral cells such as macrophages, the cholesterol transporter ABCA1 facilitates the efflux of cholesterol, which then combines with lipid-poor HDLs. An enzyme that is associated with HDL, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT)synthesized in the liver, then takes an acyl group from lecithin and esterifies it to cholesterol to produce a cholesterol ester (CE).

When the CE-enriched HDL (HDL-CE) reaches the liver, it binds to scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SR-B1), (1) N46-18 which mediates selective uptake of HDL-CE. The cholesterol moiety is targeted for biliary excretion. This pathway may also process LDL-CE and free cholesterol. In contrast to uptake by the LDL receptor, the selective uptake of CE by SR-B1 does not involve endocytosis. Instead, a poorly defined mechanism first moves CE to a reversible plasma-membrane pool and then to an irreversible pool within the cell.

# N46-18 Scavenger Receptor Class B Type 1 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The scavenger receptors can bind a very broad range of polyanionic ligands. SR-B1 does not just bind but also transports cholesterol-enriched HDL and LDL into the cell.

Not only does SR-B1 mediate the hepatic uptake of HDL-CE, but cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) in blood plasma can mediate the transfer of CE from HDL-CE to VLDLs, IDLs, and LDLs-all of which contain apolipoprotein B-100. These less-dense lipoproteins can now move to the liver for uptake by the LDL receptor. The HDLmediated removal of cholesterol from peripheral tissues via both SR-B1 and CETP for transport to the liver and excretion in bile is known as reverse cholesterol transport. This process is thought to protect against atherosclerosis.

## The liver is the prime site for metabolism and storage of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K

We discuss the intestinal uptake of the fat-soluble vitamins on page 933.

Vitamin A Vitamin A (retinol and its derivatives)-like dietary vitamin D, as well as vitamins E and K-is absorbed from the intestine and is then transported in newly synthesized chylomicrons or VLDLs. After some peripheral hydrolysis of its triacylglycerol, the remnant chylomicrons are taken up by the liver. In the hepatocyte, retinyl esters may be hydrolyzed to release free retinol, which can then be transported into the sinusoids bound to retinol-binding protein (RBP) and prealbumin. Alternatively, retinyl esters may be stored in the hepatocyte or transported as RBPbound retinol to stellate (Ito) cells, the storage site of $>80 \%$ of hepatic vitamin A under normal conditions. Retinol may also undergo oxidation to retinal and conversion to retinoic acid, which plays a key role in phototransduction (see p. 367). Retinoic acid is conjugated to glucuronide and is secreted into bile, where it undergoes enterohepatic circulation and excretion. Liver disease resulting in cholestasis may lead to a secondary vitamin A deficiency by interfering with absorption in the intestine (lack of the bile needed for digestion/absorption of vitamin A) or by impairing delivery to target tissues because of reduced hepatic synthesis of RBP.

Vitamin D Skin cells-under the influence of ultraviolet light-synthesize vitamin $\mathrm{D}_{3}$ (see p. 1064). Dietary vitamin D can come from either animal sources $\left(D_{3}\right)$ or plant sources $\left(D_{2}\right)$. In either case, the first step in activation of vitamin D is the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D, catalyzed by a hepatic cytochrome P-450 enzyme. This hydroxylation is followed by 1-hydroxylation in the kidney to yield a product (1,25dihydroxyvitamin D) with full biological activity. Termination of the activity of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D also occurs in the liver by hydroxylation at carbon 24, mediated by another cytochrome P-450 enzyme.

Vitamin E The fat-soluble vitamin E is absorbed from the intestine primarily in the form of $\alpha$ - and $\gamma$-tocopherol. It is incorporated into chylomicrons and VLDLs with other products of dietary lipid digestion. As noted above, these particles reach the systemic circulation via the lymphatics and undergo some triacylglycerol hydrolysis. In the process, some vitamin E is transferred to other tissues. The $\alpha$ and $\gamma$-tocopherol remaining in the remnant chylomicrons is transported into the liver, which is the major site of dis-
crimination between the two forms. The $\alpha$-tocopherol is secreted again as a component of hepatically derived VLDL and perhaps HDL. The $\gamma$-tocopherol appears to be metabolized or excreted by the liver. A hepatic tocopherolbinding protein may play a role in this discriminatory process.

Vitamin K Vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin produced by intestinal bacteria. This vitamin is essential for the $\gamma$-carboxylation-by the ER enzyme $\gamma$-glutamyl carboxylaseof certain glutamate residues in coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X as well as anticoagulants protein C and protein S (see Table 18-4) and certain other proteins. Intestinal absorption and handling of vitamin K -which is present in two forms, $\mathrm{K}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{K}_{2}$-are similar to those of the other fatsoluble vitamins, A, D, and E. Common causes of vitamin K deficiency, which can lead to a serious bleeding disorder, include extrahepatic or intrahepatic cholestasis, fat malabsorption, biliary fistulas, and dietary deficiency, particularly in association with antibiotic therapy.

## The liver stores copper and iron

Copper The trace element copper is essential for the function of cuproenzymes such as cytochrome C oxidase and superoxide dismutase (see p. 1238). Approximately half the copper in the diet (recommended dietary allowance, 1.5 to $3 \mathrm{mg} /$ day) is absorbed in the jejunum and reaches the liver in the portal blood, mostly bound to albumin. A small fraction is also bound to amino acids, especially histidine.

High-affinity copper import across the hepatocyte basolateral membrane is mediated by the copper transport protein CTR1 (SLC31A1). Copper then binds to members of a family of intracellular metallochaperones that direct the metal to the appropriate pathway for incorporation into cuproenzymes or for biliary excretion. It is unknown how hepatocytes distribute copper to the different intracellular routes. The copper chaperone Atox1 ferries the copper through the cytosol to the Wilson disease P-type ATPase ATP7B (Box 46-5; see also p. 118), which is located predominantly in the trans-Golgi network and late endosomes. Intracellular copper levels modulate the activity, post-translational modification, and intracellular localization of ATP7B. Once inside the vesicular lumen, copper can couple with apoceruloplasmin (apo-Cp) to form holo-ceruloplasmin holo$\mathbf{C p}$, which the hepatocyte secretes across the sinusoidal membrane into the blood. Alternatively, the hepatocyte can secrete the copper-perhaps with hepatic copper-binding proteins such as COMMD1 (copper metabolism MURR1 domain)-across the canalicular membrane into the bile. More than $80 \%$ of the copper absorbed each day is excreted in bile, for a total of 1.2 to $2.4 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. The small intestine cannot reabsorb the secreted Cu-protein complexes. Processes that impair the biliary excretion of copper result in the accumulation of copper, initially in the lysosomal fraction of hepatocytes, with subsequent elevation of plasma copper levels.

Ceruloplasmin, an $\alpha_{2}$-globulin synthesized by the liver, binds $95 \%$ of copper present in the systemic circulation. Ceruloplasmin has ferroxidase activity but has no critical role in the membrane transport or metabolism of copper.

# BOX 46-5 Wilson Disease 

W
ilison disease is inherited as an autosomal recessive illness caused by a mutation in ATP7B, the pump responsible for copper accumulation in the trans-Golgi network. The impaired biliary excretion of copper causes a buildup of copper in cells, which produces toxic effects in the liver, brain, kidney, cornea, and other tissues. The disease is rare, but it must be considered in the differential diagnosis of anyone younger than 30 years with evidence of significant liver disease. Patients most often have neuropsychiatric complications, including ataxia, tremors, increased salivation, and behavioral changes. Slit-lamp examination of the cornea reveals the diagnostic KayserFleischer rings at the limbus of the cornea.

Because of the lack of functional ATP7B, the apoceruloplasmin in the trans-Golgi network cannot bind copper to form ceruloplasmin. As a result, the hepatocytes secrete apoceruloplasmin, which lacks the ferroxidase activity of ceruloplasmin. Moreover, the serum concentrations of ceruloplasmin are low. Indeed, the best way to confirm the diagnosis of Wilson disease is the detection of a low serum ceruloplasmin level and elevated urinary copper excretion. A few affected patients have normal ceruloplasmin levels, and the diagnosis must then be sought through liver biopsy. The disease can be treated by chelating the excess copper with penicillamine.

Iron Dietary iron is absorbed by the duodenal mucosa and then transported through the blood bound to transferrin (see p. 941), a protein synthesized in the liver. The liver also takes up, secretes, and stores iron. Entry of iron into hepatocytes is mediated through specific cell-surface transferrin receptors (see p. 42). Within the cell, a small pool of soluble iron is maintained for intracellular enzymatic reactions, primarily for those involved in electron transport. However, iron is also toxic to the cell. Hence, most intracellular iron is complexed to ferritin (see p. 941). The toxicity of iron is clearly evident when normal storage mechanisms become overwhelmed, as occurs in hemochromatosis (see Box 45-6), an autosomal recessive disease in which regulation of iron absorption is uncoupled from total-body storage levels.

Hepatocytes also play a critical role in iron homeostasis by synthesizing hepcidin (see p. 941), which lowers plasma iron levels by downregulating the iron-efflux pump FPN1 (see p. 941) in the intestine and macrophages, thereby blocking the release of iron into the circulation. The consequent iron retention in duodenal enterocytes effectively blocks dietary iron absorption and leads to iron retention in reticuloendothelial macrophages. The expression of the HAMP gene, which encodes hepcidin, increases with iron loading and inflammatory cytokines, and decreases with anemia and hypoxia (consistent with enhanced erythropoiesis; see pp. 440-442).

# ORGANIZATION OF ENDOCRINE CONTROL 

Eugene J. Barrett

With the development of multicellular organisms that have specialized tissues and organs, two major systems evolved to communicate and coordinate body functions:

1. The nervous system integrates tissue functions by a network of cells and cell processes that constitute the nervous system and all subdivisions, as discussed in Chapters 10 through 16.
2. The endocrine system integrates organ function via chemicals that are secreted from endocrine tissues or "glands" into the extracellular fluid. These chemicals, called hormones, are then carried through the blood to distant target tissues where they are recognized by specific high-affinity receptors. As discussed in Chapter 3, these receptors may be located either on the surface of the target tissue, within the cytosol, or in the target cell's nucleus. These receptor molecules allow the target cell to recognize a unique hormonal signal from among the numerous chemicals that are carried through the blood and bathe the body's tissues. The accuracy and sensitivity of this recognition are remarkable in view of the very low concentration $\left(10^{-9}\right.$ to $\left.10^{-12} \mathrm{M}\right)$ at which many hormones circulate.

Once a hormone is recognized by its target tissue or tissues, it can exert its biological action by a process known as signal transduction (see Chapter 3). Here in Chapter 47, we discuss how the signal-transduction cascades couple the hormone to its appropriate end responses. Some hormones elicit responses within seconds (e.g., the increased heart rate provoked by epinephrine or the stimulation of hepatic glycogen breakdown caused by glucagon), whereas others may require many hours or days (e.g., the changes in salt retention elicited by aldosterone or the increases in protein synthesis caused by growth hormone [GH]). We also examine the principles underlying the feedback mechanisms that control endocrine function.

In Chapters 48 through 52, we see how the principles introduced in this chapter apply to some specific endocrine systems.

## PRINCIPLES OF ENDOCRINE FUNCTION

Chemical signaling can occur through endocrine, paracrine, or autocrine pathways

As shown in Figure 3-1A, in classic endocrine signaling, a hormone carries a signal from a secretory gland across a
large distance to a target tissue. Hormones secreted into the extracellular space can also regulate nearby cells without ever passing through the systemic circulation. This regulation is referred to as paracrine action of a hormone (see Fig. 3-1B). Finally, chemicals can also bind to receptors on or in the cell that is actually secreting the hormone and thus affect the function of the hormone-secreting cell itself. This action is referred to as autocrine regulation (see Fig. 3-1C). All three mechanisms are illustrated for individual endocrine systems in subsequent chapters. At the outset, it can be appreciated that summation of the endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine actions of a hormone can provide the framework for a complex regulatory system.

Endocrine Glands The major hormones of the human body are produced by one of seven classic endocrine glands or gland pairs: the pituitary, the thyroid, the parathyroids, the testes, the ovaries, the adrenals (cortex and medulla), and the endocrine pancreas. In addition, other tissues that are not classically recognized as part of the endocrine system produce hormones and play a vital role in endocrine regulation. These tissues include the central nervous system (CNS), particularly the hypothalamus, as well as the gastrointestinal tract, adipose tissue, liver, heart, and kidney.

In some circumstances, particularly with certain neoplasms, nonendocrine tissues can produce hormones that are usually thought to be made only by endocrine glands (Box 47-1).

Paracrine Factors Numerous specialized tissues that are not part of the classic endocrine system release "factors" into the extracellular fluid that can signal neighboring cells to effect a biological response. The interleukins, or lymphokines, are an example of such paracrine factors, as are several of the growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor, and others. These factors are not hormones in the usual sense. They are not secreted by glandular tissue, and their sites of action are usually (but not always) within the local environment. However, these signaling molecules share many properties of the classic peptide and amine hormones in that they bind to surface receptors and regulate one or more of the specific intracellular signaling mechanisms described in Chapter 3.

The distinction between the hormones of the classic endocrine systems and other biologically active secreted peptides blurs even further in the case of neuropeptides. For example, the hormone somatostatin, a 28 -amino-acid
