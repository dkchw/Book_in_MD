# SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION 

Sam Mesiano and Ervin E. Jones

Reproduction is a fundamental process of life. All living organisms must reproduce either asexually (e.g., bacteria) or sexually (e.g., mammals). Asexual reproduction is highly efficient and produces large numbers of genetically identical offspring in a relative short amount of time. This strategy, however, is vulnerable to environmental changes because genetic and phenotypic variation between individual progeny is minimal and consequently the probability of producing progeny that have beneficial traits in a hostile environment is relatively low. In contrast, sexual reproduction is less efficient but produces progeny with markedly increased genetic and phenotypic variation, which increases the probability of producing individuals with characteristics that may be adaptive to environmental changes. In this context, natural selection favors sexual reproduction, and consequently most extant animals and flowering plants reproduce sexually.

In sexual reproduction a new individual is created by combining the genetic material of two individuals. Sexual reproduction involves the evolution of two sexually dissimilar individuals belonging to the same species, one male and one female, and each equipped with its own specific attributes necessary for its particular contribution to the process of procreation. Each sex produces its own type of sex cell or gamete, and the union of male and female gametes generates species-specific progeny. In addition, mechanisms-some simple, some complex-have evolved to ensure the proximity and union of the sex cells, known as syngamy. Thus, within each species, the relevant sexual characteristics of each partner have adapted differently to achieve the most efficient union of these progenitor cells. These differences between the sexes of one species are called sexual dimorphism. For example, oviparous species such as frogs release their eggs into a liquid medium only when they are in relative proximity to sperm. As effective as this approach is, it also typifies the wastefulness of reproduction among higher species inasmuch as most gametes go unfertilized.

Even among species that normally reproduce sexually, sexual dimorphism is not universal. For example, monoecious (i.e., hermaphroditic) species, such as cestodes and nematodes, have the capacity to produce both sperm and eggs. By definition, the ability to produce just one kind of gamete depends on sexually dimorphic differentiation.

Organisms that reproduce sexually normally have a single pair of sex chromosomes that are morphologically distinguishable from other chromosomes, the autosomes. Each of the sex chromosomes carries genetic information that determines the primary and secondary sexual characteristics
of an individual; that is, whether the individual functions and appears as male or female. It has become abundantly clear that genes determine sexual differentiation and sexual expression and, as a result, mechanisms and patterns of reproduction.

The sex of the gonad is genetically programmed: Will a female gonad (ovary) or a male gonad (testis) develop? Although germ cells of the early embryonic gonad are totipotent, these cells develop into female gametes or ova if the gonad becomes an ovary, but they develop into male gametes or sperm if the gonad becomes a testis. These two anatomically and functionally distinct gonads determine either "maleness" or "femaleness" and dictate the development of both primary and secondary sexual characteristics. Endocrine and paracrine modulators that are specific for either the ovary or the testis are primarily responsible for female or male sexual differentiation and behavior and therefore the individual's role in procreation.

## GENETIC ASPECTS OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

## Meiosis occurs only in germ cells and gives rise to male and female gametes

Gametes derive from a specialized lineage of embryonic cells-the germline-known as germ cells. They are the only cells that can divide by mitosis and meiosis and differentiate into sperm or ova. Germ cells are therefore the critical link between generations. The process by which cells decide between becoming somatic cells of the body or germ cells occurs in the early embryo and involves factors and processes that prevent the somatic fate and induce germline differentiation. Studies in experimental model systems are beginning to unravel the complex process of germline determination, which involves germline-specific transcription factors (see pp. 81-88) and small noncoding RNAs (see pp. 99-100) and DNA methylation (see pp. 95-96) to control expression of specific genes. The process by which germ cells develop into either sperm or ova is referred to as gametogenesis and involves meiosis.

Except for the gametes, all other nucleated cells in the human body-somatic cells-have a diploid number (2N) of chromosomes. Human diploid cells have 22 autosome pairs consisting of two homologous chromosomes, one contributed by the father and one by the mother. Diploid cells also contain a single pair of sex chromosomes comprising

# N53-1 Definitions of Sex and Gender 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Gender-or, more accurately, gender identification-refers to the concept held by the individual (or by those raising the individual) that the individual is male, female, or ambivalent.

Sex refers to biological characteristics that distinguish female from male. The distinction may be made on the basis of chromosomes, gonads, internal and external morphology, and hormonal status.

either XX or XY. Each somatic cell in human females has 44 autosomes (i.e., 22 pairs) plus two X chromosomes, and each somatic cell in males has 44 autosomes plus one X and one Y chromosome. The karyotype is the total number of chromosomes and the sex chromosome combination, and thus in normal females is designated 46,XX, and in normal males, 46,XY (Fig. 53-1). Gametes have a haploid number ( N ) of chromosomes and contain either an X or Y sex chromosome.

Mitosis is the only kind of cell division that occurs in somatic cells. Mitosis results in the formation of two identical daughter cells (Fig. 53-2A), each having the same number of chromosomes (i.e., 46 in humans) and the same DNA content as the original cell. After interphase, during which nuclear DNA in the form of chromatin replicates, mitosis proceeds in a continuum of five phases:

1. Prophase. The replicated chromatin condenses into 46 chromosomes that comprise two identical sister chromatids bound together at the centromere.
2. Metaphase. The nuclear envelope breaks down, the chromosomes align along the midplane of the cell known as the metaphase plate, and microtubules enter the nuclear space and attach to the centromere of each chromosome.
3. Anaphase. The centromeres dissolve and the microtubules pull apart the sister chromatids toward opposite poles of the cell.
4. Telophase. A new nuclear membrane envelopes each cluster of chromatids, which decondense back into chromatin.
5. Cytokinesis. The cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells, each containing one of the nuclei.

Daughter cells produced by mitosis are genetically identical because there is no exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes and the sister chromatids of each chromosome split, one going to each daughter cell during anaphase of the single mitotic division.

Meiosis occurs only in germ cells-spermatogonia in males and oogonia in females-still with a complement of 2 N DNA $(\mathrm{N}=23)$. Germ cells initially multiply by mitosis and then enter meiosis when they begin to differentiate into sperm (see Fig. 53-2B) or ova (see Fig. 53-2C). Gametogenesis reduces the number of chromosomes by half, so that each gamete contains one chromosome from each of the original 23 pairs. This reduction in genetic material from the diploid ( 2 N ) to the haploid ( N ) number involves two divisions referred to as meiosis I and meiosis II. Because of this halving of the diploid number of chromosomes, meiosis is often referred to as a reduction division.

Meiosis is a continuum composed of two phases: the homologous chromosomes separate during meiosis I, and the chromatids separate during meiosis II. Prior to the start of meiosis I, the chromosomes duplicate so that the cells have 23 pairs of duplicated chromosomes (i.e., each chromosome has two chromatids)—or 4 N DNA. During prophase of the first meiotic division, homologous pairs of chromosomes-22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes (autosomes) plus a pair of sex chromosomes-exchange genetic material through a process known as recombination or crossing over at attachment points known as chiasmata. This results in a random, but balanced, exchange of chromatid segments between the homologous maternal and paternal chromatids to produce recombinant homologous chromosomes comprising a mix of maternal and paternal DNA. At the completion of meiosis I, the daughter cells have a haploid number (23) of duplicated, crossed-over chromosomes-or 2 N DNA.

During meiosis II, no additional duplication of DNA takes place. The chromatids simply separate so that each daughter receives a haploid number of unduplicated chromosomes-1N DNA. Gametes produced by this process are genetically different from each other and from either parent. The genetic diversity that arises from recombination during meiosis and the combining of gametes from different parental lineages causes significant phenotypic variation within the population, providing an efficient mechanism for adaptation and natural selection.

A major difference between male and female gametogenesis is that one spermatogonium yields four spermatids (see Fig. 53-2B), whereas one oogonium yields one mature oocyte and two or three polar bodies (see Fig. 53-2C). We discuss the details regarding timing and process for spermatogenesis on page 1100, and for oogenesis on page 1120.

## Fertilization of an oocyte by an X- or Y-bearing sperm establishes the zygote's genotypic sex

Fusion of two haploid gametes, a mature spermatozoan from the father and a mature oocyte from the mother-referred to as fertilization-produces a new diploid cell with 2 N DNA, a zygote, that will become a new individual.

The representation in Figure 53-1 is obtained by taking photomicrographs of chromosomes and then rearranging them as shown. The chromosomes are numbered according to size, the largest chromosomes having the smallest number. Pairs of homologous chromosomes are identified on the basis of size, patterns of banding, and the placement of centromeres.

In the case of humans, one generally uses leukocytes (white blood cells) that have been treated with a hypotonic solution to cause swelling and thus help disperse the chromosomes, and with colchicine to arrest mitosis in metaphase. A dye is then applied to visualize the chromosomes better.

Figure 53-2 Mitosis and meiosis. A, In mitosis, the two daughter cells are genetically identical to the mother cell. B, In male meiosis, the four daughter cells are haploid. Cell division I produces both recombination (i.e., crossing over of genetic material between homologous chromosomes) and reduction to the haploid number of chromosomes. Cell division II separates the chromatids of each chromosome, just as in mitosis. C, Female meiosis is similar to male meiosis. A major difference is that instead of producing four mature gametes, female meiosis produces only one mature gamete and two polar bodies (or, if the first polar body divides, three polar bodies). $\bigcirc$ NS3-8

The sex chromosomes that the parents contribute to the offspring determine the genotypic sex of that individual. The genotypic sex determines the gonadal sex, which in turn determines the phenotypic sex that becomes fully established at puberty. Thus, sex-determining mechanisms established at fertilization direct all later ontogenetic processes (processes that lead to the development of an organism) involved in male-female differentiation.

Fusion of a sperm and an egg-two haploid germ cellsresults in a zygote, which is a diploid cell containing 46 chromosomes (see Fig. 53-1): 22 pairs of somatic chromosomes (autosomes) and a single pair of sex chromosomes. In females, these sex chromosomes are both X chromosomes, whereas males have one X and one Y chromosome.

When the karyotypes of normal females and males are compared, two differences are apparent. First, among the 23 pairs of chromosomes in females, 8 pairs-including the 2 X chromosomes-are of similar size, whereas males have only $71 / 2$ such pairs. Second, instead of a second X chromosome, males have a Y chromosome that is small and acrocentric (i.e., the centromere is located at one end of the chromosome): this chromosome is the only such chromosome that is not present in females.

In the offspring, 23 of the chromosomes-including 1 of the sex chromosomes-are from the mother, and 23including the other sex chromosome-come from the father. Thus, the potential offspring has a unique complement of chromosomes differing from those of both the mother and

# N53-8 Meiosis in Males versus Females 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 53-2B in the text shows meiosis in the male, whereas Figure 53-2C shows meiosis in the female.

In both males and females, the primordial germ cell (PGC) enters the gonad and undergoes many rounds of mitotic divisions. At some point, both a spermatogonium (in the case of males) and an oogonium (in the case of females) enter the first of two meiotic divisions (top cell in Fig. 53-2B, $O$.

In the case of males (see Fig. 53-2B), one primary spermatocyte (diploid 4N DNA)—a cell that has just entered pro-phasel—ultimately gives rise to two secondary spermatocytes (haploid 2N DNA) at the completion of the first meiotic division, and four spermatids (haploid 1N DNA) at the completion of the second meiotic division. Thus, one primary spermatocyte yields four mature gametes.

In the case of females (see Fig. 53-2C), one primary oocyte (diploid 4N DNA)—a cell that is arrested in prophase I until shortly before ovulation—ultimately gives rise to one secondary oocyte (haploid 2N DNA) and one diminutive first polar body (haploid 2N DNA) at the completion of the first meiotic division. The polar body is equivalent to one of the two cells at telophase I in Figure 53-2B. In the second meiotic division, which the cell completes at the time of fertilization, the secondary oocyte gives rise to one mature oocyte (haploid 1N DNA) and a diminutive second polar body (haploid 1N DNA). Thus, unlike the situation in males, one primary oocyte yields one mature gamete-equivalent to one of the four cells at the bottom of Figure 53-2B.

Note that the first polar body sometimes divides during meiosis II, thereby yielding a total of three polar bodies and one oocyte. This is the same amount of DNA produced in spermatogenesis (i.e., four spermatids from one spermatogonium).

the father. The ovum provided by the mother (XX) always provides an X chromosome. Because the male is the heterogenetic (XY) sex, half the spermatozoa are X bearing whereas the other half are Y bearing. Thus, the type of sperm that fertilizes the ovum determines the sex of the zygote. X-bearing sperm produce XX zygotes that develop into females with a 46,XX karyotype, whereas Y-bearing sperm produce XY zygotes that develop into males with a 46,XY karyotype. The genotypic sex of an individual is determined at the time of fertilization. The Y chromosome appears to be the fundamental determinant of sexual development. When a Y chromosome is present, the individual develops as a male; when the Y chromosome is absent, the individual develops as a female. In embryos with abnormal sex chromosome complexes, the number of X chromosomes is apparently of little significance.

## Genotypic sex determines differentiation of the indifferent gonad into either an ovary or a testis

The indifferent gonad is composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. In embryos with an XY sex chromosome complement (i.e., 46, XY ), the medulla differentiates into a testis and the cortex regresses. On the other hand, in embryos with an XX sex chromosome complement (i.e., 46,XX), the cortex develops into an ovary and the medulla regresses. Thus, the Y chromosome exerts a powerful testis-determining effect on the indifferent gonad. In the absence of a Y chromosome, the indifferent gonad develops into an ovary.

Interestingly, two X chromosomes are necessary for normal ovarian development. In individuals with the karyotype 45,XO-Turner syndrome-the ovaries fail to develop fully and appear as streaks on the pelvic sidewall (Box 53-1).

## BOX 53-1 Gonadal Dysgenesis

The best-known example of gonadal dysgenesis is a syndrome referred to as Turner syndrome, a disorder of the female sex characterized by short stature, primary amenorrhea, sexual infantilism, and certain other congenital abnormalities. Cells in these individuals have a 45,XO karyotype (i.e., they lack one of the X chromosomes). The gonads of individuals with Turner syndrome appear as firm, flat, glistening streaks (referred to as streak gonads) lying below the fallopian tubes with no evidence of either germinal or secretory elements. Instead, they are largely composed of connective tissue arranged in whorls suggestive of ovarian stroma. Individuals with Turner syndrome have normal female differentiation of both the internal and external genitalia, although these genitalia are usually small and immature.

Turner syndrome can also be caused by partial deletion of the $\mathbf{X}$ chromosome, particularly if the entire short arm of the X chromosome is missing, or by formation of an X-chromosome ring that develops as a result of a deletion and subsequent joining of the two free ends of the chromosome.

In at least half of affected individuals, Turner syndrome is caused by the total absence of one X chromosome. In others, the lesion is structural (i.e., partial deletion or ring chromosome). In at least a third of cases, the genetic lesion appears as part of a mosaicism; that is, some of the cells carry the aberrant or absent chromosome, whereas the rest are normal.

Even the absence of only some genetic material from one X chromosome in XX individuals (e.g., due to chromosome breakage or deletion) may cause abnormal gonadal differentiation. However, a complete Y chromosome is necessary for development of the testes. Indeed, individuals with the karyotype 47,XXY-Klinefelter syndrome-are not phenotypic females (based on the presence of two X chromosomes) but males. Taken together, the data on 45, XO and 47,XXY individuals tell us that the absence of a Y chromosome causes female phenotypic development.

We have just seen that the absence of a Y chromosome and the presence of two complete X chromosomes lead to normal ovarian development. Why? The X chromosome is far larger than the Y chromosome (see Fig. 53-1) and contains nearly $10 \%$ of the human genome compared to $<100$ genes on the Y chromosome. Thus, the large number of X-linked diseases-affecting such processes as blood clotting and color vision-is hardly surprising. Compared with males, females have a double dose of X-chromosome genes. To avoid an overdosage of X -derived gene products, each somatic 46,XX cell at the blastocyst stage separately and randomly inactivates either the maternal or paternal X chromosome in a process called Iyonization. Once inactivated, that X chromosome remains inactivated for the life of the cell and all of its descendants. The inactivated X chromosome is visible at interphase as a small dark dot of condensed chromatin in the nucleus known as the Barr body. Presence of a Barr body can be used to determine the genotypic sex of a cell. If one X chromosome is normally inactivated in females, then why are two X chromosomes necessary for normal ovarian development, as evidenced by the deficiencies in 45, XO individuals? The answer is that many genes on the inactivated X chromosome somehow are not silenced and are necessary for normal ovarian development.

## The testis-determining gene is located on the Y chromosome

With rare exceptions (see below), a Y chromosome (Fig. 53-3A) is necessary for normal testicular development. Thus, it stands to reason that the gene that determines organogenesis of the testis is normally located on the Y chromosome. This so-called testis-determining factor (TDF) has been mapped to the short arm of the Y chromosome and indeed turns out to be a single gene called $S R Y$ (for sex-determining region $Y$ ). The $\boldsymbol{S R Y}$ gene encodes a transcription factor that belongs to the high-mobility group (HMG) superfamily of transcription factors. The family to which $S R Y$ belongs is evolutionarily ancient. One portion of the SRY protein, the 80-amino-acid HMG box, which actually binds to the DNA-is highly conserved among members of the family.

Rarely, the TDF may also be found translocated on other chromosomes. One example is a 46,XX male (see Fig. 53-3B), an individual whose sex chromosome complement is XX but whose phenotype is male. During normal male meiosis, human X and Y chromosomes pair and recombine at the distal end of their short arms. It appears that most 46,XX males arise as a result of an aberrant exchange of paternal genetic material between X and Y chromosomes during spermatogenesis. In such cases, the TDF is transferred from a Y chromatid to an X chromatid. If the sperm cell that

Figure 53-3 Location of the testis-determining region of the $Y$ chromosome and an example of translocation. A, The $Y$ chromosome is much smaller than the $X$ chromosome. Giemsa staining of the chromosome results in alternating light and dark bands, some of which are shown here. The short or "p" arm of the Y chromosome is located above the centromere, whereas the long or "q" arm is located below. The numbers to the left of the chromosome indicate the position of bands. The TDF is the $S R Y$ gene. B, Crossing-over events between normal $X$ and $Y$ chromosomes of the father can generate an $X$ chromatid that contains a substantial portion of the TDF region and a Y chromatid that lacks its TDF. The figure shows both an equal and an unequal recombination event. If a sperm cell bearing an $X$ chromosome with a translocated TDF fertilizes an ovum, the result is a male with a $46, X X$ karyotype, because one of the $X$ chromosomes contains the TDF. Conversely, if the sperm cell carries a $Y$ chromosome lacking its TDF, the result can be a $46, X Y$ individual that appears to be female.
fertilizes the ovum contains such an X chromosome with a TDF, the resultant individual will be a $46, \mathrm{XX}$ male.

## Endocrine and paracrine messengers modulate phenotypic differentiation

Just as an individual's genes determine whether the indifferent gonad develops into an ovary or a testis, so does the sex of the gonad dictate the gonad's endocrine and paracrine functions. Normally, chemical messengers-both endocrine and paracrine-produced by the gonad determine the primary and secondary sexual phenotypes of the individual. However, if the gonads fail to produce the proper messengers, if other organs (e.g., the adrenal glands) produce abnormal levels of sex steroids, or if the mother is exposed to chemical agents (e.g., synthetic progestins, testosterone) during pregnancy, sexual development of the fetus may deviate from that programmed by the genotype. Therefore, genetic determination of sexual differentiation is not irrevocable; numerous internal and external influences

## BOX 53-2 Discordance Between Genotype and Gonadal Phenotype

Discordance between genotypic and phenotypic sex are referred to as disorders of sex development (DSD), a term that describes congenital conditions in which development of chromosomal, gonadal, or anatomical sex is atypical. The term DSD avoids gender labeling in the diagnosis as well as names with negative social connotation (e.g., hermaphrodite, pseudohermaphrodite, intersex) that some patients and parents may perceive to be harmful.

Most DSD conditions are caused by aberrant expression of $S R Y$. For example, a number of patients have no recognizable $Y$ chromosome but do have testes. Some of these individuals are $46, X X$ and possess both male and female sex organs. Others have mixed gonadal dysgenesis-a testis in addition to a streak ovary-and a 46,XO karyotype. Some affected individuals have only one type of gonadal tissue but morphological characteristics of both sexes. All these patterns can result from mosaicisms (e.g., 46,XY/46,XX) or from translocation of the $S R Y$ gene (see Fig. 53-3B) -which normally resides on the $Y$ chromosome-to either an $X$ chromosome or an autosome. A "normal" testis in the absence of a $Y$ chromosome has never been reported.

Another group of individuals with a karyotype of $46, X Y$ has pure gonadal dysgenesis-streak gonads, but no somatic features of XO. In the past investigators assumed that these individuals possessed an abnormal Y chromosome. Perhaps the $S R Y$ gene is absent or its expression is somehow blocked.
during development may modify or completely reverse the phenotype of the individual, whatever the genotypic sex (Box 53-2).

## DIFFERENTIATION OF THE GONADS

The primary sex organs of an individual are the gonads: testes in males and ovaries in females. During embryonic development, the gonads originate as bilateral swellings in the intermediate mesoderm (coelomic epithelium and the underlying urogenital mesenchyme) adjacent to the developing kidneys. Early on (approximately fifth week in humans; Fig. 53-4A), these gonadal ridges are identical in the two sexes and are referred to as the indifferent gonads (see Fig. 53-4B). They are composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla (see Fig. 53-4C) and capable of becoming either testis (see Fig. 53-4D) or ovary (see Fig. 53-4E). The products of genes on the sex chromosomes determine whether each indifferent gonad differentiates into a testis or an ovary. Thus, genotypic sex determines gonadal sex.

## Primordial germ cells migrate from the yolk sac to the primordial gonad

Germ cells-cells that give rise to gametes-play a key role in sexual differentiation by affecting gonad development. The primordial germ cells (PGCs) do not originate in the gonad; instead, they migrate to the gonad from the yolk sac along the mesentery of the hindgut at about the fifth

![bo040346323f](bo040346323f.jpg)

Figure 53-4 Early gonad and germ cell migration. A, The PGCs originate in the endodermal endothelium of the yolk sac. B, The PGCs migrate along the mesentery of the hindgut and reach the region of the urogenital ridge called the gonadal ridge. C, The indifferent gonad consists of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. D, The testis develops from the medulla of the indifferent gonad; the cortex regresses. E, The ovary develops from the cortex of the indifferent gonad; the medulla regresses.
week of embryo development (see Fig. 53-4A, B). The PGCs of humans are first found in the endodermal epithelium of the yolk sac in the vicinity of the allantoic stalk, and from there the germ cells migrate into the adjoining mesenchyme. During their journey they divide by mitosis. They eventually take up their position embedded in the gonadal ridges. Gonadal development fails to progress normally in the absence of germ cells. Thus, any event that interferes with germ cell migration may cause abnormal gonadal differentiation.

The gonad forms from a portion of the coelomic epithelium, the underlying mesenchyme, and the PGCs that
migrate from the yolk sac. At 5 weeks' development, a thickened area of coelomic epithelium develops on the medial aspect of the urogenital ridge as a result of proliferation of both the coelomic epithelium and cells of the underlying mesenchyme. This prominence, which forms on the medial aspect of the mesonephros, is known as the gonadal ridge (see Fig. 53-4B, C).

Migration of the PGCs to the gonadal ridge establishes the anlagen for the primordial gonad. The primordial gonad at this early stage of development consists of both a peripheral cortex and a central medulla (see Fig. 53-4C) and has the capacity to develop into either an ovary or a testis. The

cortex and medulla have different fates in males and females. The genotypic sex of the embryo directs the sexual development of the gonads. In an embryo with a 46,XY karyotype, the medullary portion of the gonad develops to become a testis and the cortex regresses. Conversely, 46,XX germ cells stimulate development of the cortex of the early gonad to become an ovary and the medulla regresses.

## The primitive testis develops from the medulla of the primordial gonad

In male embryos, PGCs migrate from the cortex of the gonad, in which they were originally embedded, into the primitive sex cords of the medulla. There the PGCs induce maturation of primitive sex cord structures, which become hollowed out (see Fig. 53-4D) and develop into the seminiferous tubules, including the Sertoli cells. The PGCs also give rise to spermatogonia (see p. 1100), the first cells in the pathway to mature sperm. Remnants of the primitive sex cords also form the rete testis, a system of thin, interconnected tubules that develop in the dorsal part of the gonad; they drain the seminiferous tubules into the efferent ductules, which develop from the adjoining tubules of the mesonephros (see pp. 1079-1080). These tubular structures establish a pathway from the male gonad to the mesonephric duct, which evolves into the outlet for sperm. At the same time, the cortex regresses to form a thin epithelial layer covering the coelomic surface of the testis, and mesenchymal cells take up residence among the sex cords and eventually become the Leydig cells of the testis. At around the 10th week of development, the Leydig cells respond to fetal pituitary and placental hormones (mainly human chorionic gonadotropin; see p. 1111) by producing testosterone, which influences the differentiation of the external genitalia.

The main cell types within the seminiferous tubules are Sertoli cells and spermatogonia, which continue to divide by mitosis (albeit slowly) until puberty. At puberty the rate of spermatogonia division increases and a subgroup of spermatogonia begin meiosis and enter the process of spermatogenesis to produce mature sperm. A stem-cell population of spermatogonia is maintained by mitosis throughout the life of the male.

## The primitive ovary develops from the cortex of the primordial gonad

In female embryos, the medulla of the gonad regresses, the primary sex cords are resorbed, and the interior of the gonad is filled with a loose mesenchyme that is highly permeated by blood vessels. However, the cortex greatly increases in thickness, due to the investment of mitotically dividing PGCs, which remain embedded within it and give rise to oogonia (see Fig. 53-4E). By the eighth week the developing ovaries contain around 600,000 oogonia and that number increases to 6 to 7 million by week 20 . A large number of oogonia die and become resorbed; the remainder become surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells to form primordial follicles and enter meiosis to become primary oocytes (see pp. 1120-1121). Unlike spermatogonia, the entire investment of oogonia (surviving PGCs) in the developing ovary is irreversibly committed to meiosis by the 20th
week of development. At this stage, the oocytes are arrested at prophase I of meiosis and remain in that state until the follicle is selected for maturation or death later in life. At birth, each ovary holds around 1 million primordial follicles, each containing one primary oocyte arrested at prophase I. Because all the oogonia are depleted at midgestation (they either die or become oocytes), the number of primordial follicles formed at that time is all that will be available for reproduction for the rest of the female's life. This process is distinct from spermatogenesis, which occurs continually after puberty due to the replenishment of spermatogonia by mitosis.

## DEVELOPMENT OF THE ACCESSORY SEX ORGANS

## The embryonic gonad determines the development of the internal genitalia and the external sexual phenotype

Higher vertebrates, including humans, have evolved elaborate systems of glands and ducts-collectively referred to as the accessory sex organs-for storing and transporting gametes. Together the gonads and accessory sex organs constitute the primary sex characteristics. The accessory sex organs can be divided into the external and internal components. In males the external organs are the penis and scrotum. Although they are outside the abdominal cavity, the testicles, contained in the scrotum, are usually considered internal organs. Other internal organs are the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory ducts, prostate, and bulbourethral glands. In females the external organs include the vulva, labia, and clitoris; the internal organs are the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes.

Secondary sex characteristics are external specializations that are not essential for the production and movement of gametes; instead, they are primarily concerned with sex behavior and with the birth and nutrition of offspring. Examples include pubic hair and breasts. Not only do the sex steroids produced by the gonads affect the accessory sex organs, they also modulate the physiological state of the secondary sex characteristics toward "maleness" in the case of the testes and "femaleness" in the case of the ovaries.

## Embryos of both sexes have a double set of embryonic genital ducts

The internal genital ducts and accessory sex organs are derived from embryonic duct systems-the wolffian ducts (or mesonephric ducts) and the müllerian ducts (or paramesonephric ducts)-and the urogenital sinus (Fig. 53-5A). The genital ducts are an essential part of the genital organs and form the pathway by which the sex cells-ova and spermatozoa-move to the location of fertilization.

It is worth recalling that during mammalian embryogenesis, three sets of kidneys develop, two of which are transient. The pronephric kidney, which develops first, is so rudimentary that it never functions. However, the duct that connects the pronephric kidney to the urogenital sinus-the pronephric duct-eventually serves the same purpose for the second kidney, the mesonephric kidney or mesonephros, as it

![bo050346323f](bo050346323f.jpg)

Figure 53-5 Transformation of the genital ducts. A, At the time that the gonad is still indifferent, it is closely associated with the mesonephros as well as the excretory duct (mesonephric or wolffian duct) that leads from the mesonephros to the urogenital sinus. Parallel to the wolffian ducts are the paramesonephric or müllerian ducts, which merge caudally to form the uterovaginal primordium. B, In males, the mesonephros develops into the epididymis. The wolffian duct develops into the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory duct. The müllerian ducts degenerate. C, In females, the mesonephros as well as the wolffian (mesonephric) ducts degenerate. The paramesonephric or müllerian ducts develop into the fallopian tubes, the uterus, the cervix, and the upper one third of the vagina.
develops embryologically. Unlike the pronephric kidney, the mesonephros functions transiently as a kidney. It has glomeruli and renal tubules; these tubules empty into the wolffian duct (see Fig. 53-5A), which in turn carry fluid to the urogenital sinus. As discussed below, the mesonephros and its wolffian ducts will-depending on the sex of the developing embryo-either degenerate or develop into other reproductive structures. In addition to the wolffian ducts, a second pair of genital ducts, the müllerian ducts, will develop as invaginations of the coelomic epithelium on the lateral aspects of the mesonephros. The müllerian ducts run caudally and parallel to the wolffian ducts. In the caudal region, they cross ventral to the wolffian ducts and fuse to form a cylindrical structure, the uterovaginal canal. The third or metanephric kidney becomes the permanent mammalianian
kidney. Its excretory duct is the ureter. Early in development ( $<7$ weeks) embryos of both sexes have wolffian and müllerian ducts (see Fig. 53-4C and Fig. 53-5A). However, later in gestation (by the 10th week) only one of the duct systems survives in each sex: wolffian ducts in males and müllerian ducts in females.

## In males, the wolffian ducts become the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and ejaculatory duct

During development, the mesonephros ceases to be an excretory organ in both sexes and disappears entirely in females. As the mesonephros degenerates in males, caudal mesonephric tubules develop into many parallel efferent

ductules that connect the upstream rete testis to the head of the epididymis, which serves as a reservoir for sperm.

In male embryos, the müllerian ducts regress and the wolffian ducts develop into the channels through which the spermatozoa pass from the testis to the urethra (see Fig. 53-5B). The most proximal portion of the wolffian duct becomes the head, the body, and the tail of the epididymis. The tail of the epididymis connects to the vas deferens, which also arises from the wolffian duct. A lateral outgrowth from the distal end of the mesonephric duct forms the seminal vesicle. The portion of the mesonephric duct between the seminal vesicle and the point where the mesonephric duct joins the urethra becomes the ejaculatory duct. At about the level where the ejaculatory duct joins with the urethra, multiple outgrowths of the urethra grow into the underlying mesenchyme and form the prostate gland. The mesenchyme of the prostate gives rise to the stroma of the prostate, whereas the prostatic glands develop from endodermal cells of the prostatic urethra.

## In females, the müllerian ducts become the fallopian tubes, the uterus, and the upper third of the vagina

In female embryos, the mesonephros and the wolffian ducts degenerate. The müllerian ducts persist and establish three functional regions (see Fig. 53-5C). The cranial portions of the müllerian ducts remain separate and give rise to the fallopian tubes. The upper end of the duct develops a fringe, which will become the fimbriae, by adding a series of minor pits or müllerian tunnels. The midportions of the left and right müllerian ducts fuse and give rise to the fundus and corpus of the uterus. The most distal portions of the fused bilateral müllerian ducts form the uterovaginal primordium that gives rise to the cervix and the upper third of the vagina. The lower two thirds of the vagina and external female genitalia are derived from the urogenital sinus.

## In males, development of the wolffian ducts requires testosterone

As already noted, the developing embryo has two precursor duct systems (Fig. 53-6A). In a normal male embryo (see Fig. 53-6B), the wolffian ducts develop whereas the müllerian ducts regress. In a normal female embryo (see Fig. 53-6C), the müllerian ducts develop whereas the wolffian ducts regress. It appears that maturation of one of these systems and degeneration of the other depend on local factors produced by the developing gonad.

A classic series of experiments performed by Alfred Jost in 1953 revealed that male sexual differentiation requires factors produced by fetal testicular tissue. The experimental approach was to castrate rabbit fetuses at various stages of development and allow the pregnancies to continue. Castrating a male fetus before maturation of the wolffian ducts causes the wolffian ducts to regress and the müllerian ducts to persist (i.e., fail to regress), which induces the development of female internal and external genitalia (see Fig. 53-6D). However, castrating female fetuses at a comparable stage in development has no appreciable effect, and müllerian development continues along normal female lines (see Fig. 53-6E). Thus, although normal male development
requires the testes, development of the fallopian tubes and uterus does not require the ovaries.

Unilateral removal of the testis resulted in female duct development on the same (ipsilateral) side as the castration, but virilization of the external genitalia proceeded normally (see Fig. 53-6F). Removing both testes-and administering testosterone-resulted in essentially normal development of the wolffian ducts, but no müllerian regression was seen (see Fig. 53-6G). Thus, although testosterone can support wolffian development, it is unable to cause müllerian regression. It became clear that a testicular product other than testosterone is necessary for regression of the müllerian ducts. Thus, one would predict that treating a normal female with testosterone would lead to preservation of the wolffian ducts, as well as the müllerian ducts. This pattern of dual ducts is indeed observed (see Fig. 53-6H).

## In males, antimüllerian hormone causes regression of the müllerian ducts

After Jost, other investigators performed experiments indicating that the Sertoli cells of the testis produce a nonsteroid macromolecule-antimüllerian hormone (AMH) or müllerian-inhibiting substance (MIS)-that causes müllerian degeneration in the male fetus. AMH, a growthinhibitory glycoprotein, is a member of the transforming growth factor- $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) superfamily of glycoproteins involved in the regulation of growth and differentiation (see p. 68). Besides TGF- $\beta$, this gene superfamily includes the inhibins and activins, which also play key regulatory roles in the reproductive system (see pp. 1095 and 1113-1115). The proteins produced by this gene family are all synthesized as dimeric precursors and undergo post-translational processing for activation. AMH is glycosylated and is secreted as a $140-\mathrm{kDa}$ dimer consisting of two identical disulfide-linked subunits. The antimitogenic activity and müllerian duct bioactivity of AMH reside primarily in its C-terminal domain.

The human AMH gene is located on chromosome 19, and AMH is one of the earliest sexually dimorphic genes expressed during development. The transcription factor SRY, which represents the TDF, may be involved in initiating the transcription of AMH. The sequential timing of SRY and AMH expression is consistent with activation of AMH by SRY, a series of events that may control sexual dimorphism.

Although the exact mechanism of AMH action has not been completely clarified, it is thought to involve receptormediated dephosphorylation. AMH appears to act directly on mesenchymal cells of the müllerian duct and indirectly, through the mesenchyme, on müllerian duct epithelial cells. AMH binding has been localized to the mesenchymal cells surrounding the müllerian duct and to the developing oocytes in preantral follicles.

During embryogenesis in males, AMH-which is secreted by the Sertoli cells in the testis-causes involution of the müllerian ducts, whereas testosterone-which is secreted by the Leydig cells of the testis-stimulates differentiation of the wolffian ducts. In females, the müllerian ducts differentiate spontaneously in the absence of AMH, and the wolffian ducts involute spontaneously in the absence of testosterone.

Figure 53-6 Jost experiments. A, Very early in development, both the wolffian (mesonephric) and the müllerian (paramesonephric) ducts are present in parallel. B, In the normal male, the wolffian duct develops into the vas deferens, the seminal vesicles, and the ejaculatory duct. The müllerian ducts degenerate. C, In the normal female, the müllerian ducts develop into the fallopian tubes, the uterus, the cervix, and the upper one third of the vagina. The wolffian ducts degenerate. D, Bilateral removal of the testes deprives the embryo of both antimüllerian hormone (AMH) and testosterone. Absence of AMH causes the müllerian ducts to follow the female pattern of development. In the absence of testosterone, the wolffian ducts degenerate. Thus, the genetically male fetus develops female internal and external genitalia. E, After bilateral removal of the ovaries, müllerian development continues along normal female lines. Thus, the ovary is not required for female duct development. F, Unilateral removal of a testis results in female duct development on the same (ipsilateral) side as the castration. Duct development follows the male pattern on the side with the remaining testis. Virilization of the external genitalia proceeds normally. G, In the absence of both testes, administering testosterone preserves development of the wolffian ducts. However, because of the absence of AMH, there is no müllerian regression. H, In the presence of both ovaries, administration of testosterone promotes development of the wolffian ducts. Because there are no testes-and thus no AMH-the müllerian ducts develop normally.

## DIFFERENTIATION OF THE EXTERNAL GENITALIA

## The urogenital sinus develops into the urinary bladder, the urethra, and, in females, the vestibule of the vagina

Early in embryological development, a tubular structure called the cloaca is the common termination of the urogenital and gastrointestinal systems (Fig. 53-7A). The cloacal membrane separates the cloaca from the amniotic fluid. Eventually, a wedge of mesenchymal tissue separates the
cloaca into a dorsal and a ventral cavity (see Fig. 53-7B). The dorsal cavity is the rectum. The ventral compartment is the urogenital sinus. Both the wolffian and the müllerian ducts empty into this urogenital sinus (see Fig. 53-5A).

The urogenital sinus can be divided into three regions: vesicle, pelvic, and phallic. In males (see Fig. 53-7C), the vesicle region becomes the urinary bladder, the pelvic region becomes the prostatic part of the urethra, and the phallic region becomes the initial portion of the penile urethra.

In females (see Fig. 53-7D), the vesicle region of the urogenital sinus also develops into the urinary bladder.

![bo080346323f](bo080346323f.jpg)

Figure 53-7 Differentiation of the urogenital sinus. A, The urorectal septum begins to separate the rectum (dorsal) from the urogenital sinus (ventral). The urogenital sinus is divided into a vesicle (i.e., urinary bladder) part, a pelvic part, and a phallic part. The common space into which the rectum and urogenital sinus empty, the cloaca, is closed by the cloacal membrane. B, At this stage, the rectum and the urogenital sinus are fully separated. The urogenital membrane separates the urogenital sinus from the outside of the embryo. C, The male has a common opening for the reproductive and urinary tracts. The prostatic utricle, which is the male homolog of the vagina, empties into the prostatic urethra. D, A solid core of tissue called the vaginal plate grows caudally from the posterior wall of the urogenital sinus. The lumen of the vagina forms as the center of this plate resorbs. Thus, the female has separate openings for the urinary and reproductive systems.

The pelvic region becomes the entire female urethra. The phallic region of the urogenital sinus develops into the vestibule of the vagina; into this vestibule empty the urethra, the vagina, and the ducts of the greater vestibular glands of Bartholin.

As noted above, fusion of the caudal portion of the müllerian ducts produces the uterovaginal primordium. Contact of this primordium with the dorsal wall of the urogenital sinus induces the development of paired sinovaginal bulbs, which grow into the urogenital sinus and then fuse to form a solid core of tissue called the vaginal plate. This plate grows caudally to the phallic portion of the urogenital sinus. Resorption of the center of the vaginal plate creates the vaginal lumen. The remaining cells of the vaginal plate form the vaginal epithelium. During early fetal development, a thin membrane, the hymen, separates the lumen of the vagina from the cavity of the urogenital sinus. Usually, the hymen partially opens during the prenatal period. Occasionally, the hymen persists completely, does not allow escape of the menstrual effluvium at menarche, and gives rise to a condition known clinically as hematocolpos.

In males, the vagina disappears when the müllerian ducts are resorbed. However, remnants of the vagina sometimes persist as a prostatic utricle.

## The external genitalia of both sexes develop from common anlagen

Although anatomically separate precursors give rise to the internal sex organs, common anlagen give rise to the external genitalia of the two sexes (Fig. 53-8A). Knowledge of the common origins of the external genitalia during normal development facilitates understanding of the ambiguities of abnormal sexual development.

The genital tubercle (see Fig. 53-8B) develops during the fourth week on the ventral side of the cloacal membrane. As a result of elongation of the genital tubercle, a phallus develops in both sexes. The genital tubercle of the primitive embryo develops into the glans penis in males (see Fig. 53-8C) and the clitoris in females (see Fig. 53-8D). Until about the end of the first trimester of pregnancy, the external genitalia of males and females are anatomically indistinguishable. The phallus undergoes rapid growth in females initially, but its growth slows, and in the absence of androgens, the phallus becomes the relatively small clitoris in females.

The paired urogenital folds give rise to the ventral aspect of the penis in males (see Fig. 53-8C) and the labia minora in females (see Fig. 53-8D). After formation of the

B, Early in the fourth week of development-in both sexes-the genital tubercle begins to enlarge to form the phallus. C, In males, the genital tubercle becomes the glans penis. The urogenital folds fuse to form the shaft of the penis. The labioscrotal swellings become the scrotum. D, In females, the genital tubercle becomes the clitoris. The urogenital folds remain separate as the labia minora. The labioscrotal swellings become the labia majora where they remain unfused. Ventrally, the labioscrotal swellings fuse to form the mons pubis. Dorsally they fuse to form the posterior labial commissure.

urogenital opening, a groove-the urethral groove-forms on the ventral side of the phallus; this groove is continuous with the urogenital opening. The bilateral urogenital folds fuse over the urethral groove to form an enclosed spongy urethra; the line of fusion is the penile raphé. As the urogenital folds fuse to form the ventral covering of the penis, they do so in a posterior-to-anterior direction, thus displacing the urethral orifice to the tip of the penis. Elongation of the genital tubercle and fusion of the genital folds occur at the 12th to the 14th week of gestation. However, in females, the urogenital folds normally remain separate as the labia minora.

In males, the genital or labioscrotal swellings fuse to give rise to the scrotum. In females, however, the labioscrotal swellings fuse anteriorly to give rise to the mons pubis and posteriorly to form the posterior labial commissure. The unfused labioscrotal swellings give rise to the labia majora.

## ENDOCRINE AND PARACRINE CONTROL OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION

## The SRY gene triggers development of the testis, which makes the androgens and AMH necessary for male sexual differentiation

As noted above, the female pattern of sexual differentiation is the default program and the male pattern of sexual differentiation is directed by endocrine and paracrine factors produced by the testes. Therefore, we will successively examine the control of testicular development, the development of the male internal system of genital ducts, and the development of the male urogenital sinus and external genitalia.

Figure 53-9 summarizes the regulatory cascade that determines the pathway for sex determination. The indifferent gonad develops into a testis in response to TDF-the product of the $S R Y$ gene (see p. 1075)-before week 9 of

Figure 53-9 Pathways for the hormonal control of sex determination.

development. If TDF is not present or if TDF is present only after the critical window of 9 weeks has passed, an ovary will develop instead of a testis. Further male-pattern sexual differentiation depends on the presence of three hormones: testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and AMH. The testis directly produces both testosterone and AMH. Peripheral tissues convert testosterone to DHT.

Testosterone Production Both the fetal and the postnatal testis produce testosterone, the primary male sex steroid (see pp. 1097-1100), and, in lesser amounts, DHT and estradiol. The Leydig cells (see p. 1095) are the source of testosterone production in the testes. The early increase in the number of Leydig cells and secretion of testosterone in humans could depend on either maternal human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or fetal luteinizing hormone. The human testis has its greatest abundance of side-chain-cleavage enzyme-which catalyzes the first committed step in steroid synthesis (see Fig. 50-2)-at 14 to 15 weeks of gestation and low values by 26 weeks of gestation. Because hCG follows a similar temporal pattern, it may be hCG that supports early testosterone production. Late regulation of testosterone production by fetal luteinizing hormone is supported by the finding that the testes of anencephalic fetuses, which lack a functional pituitary gland (see Box 10-2) at term, have few Leydig cells.

Androgen Receptor The androgenic steroid hormones, principally testosterone and DHT, passively move into target cells and act by binding to the androgen receptor (AR), which functions as a ligand-activated transcription factor to modulate the expression of genes whose products affect cell function and phenotype (see pp. 71-72). ARs are present in cells of the wolfrian ducts and urogenital sinus tissues.

Congenital absence or abnormality of AR leads to androgen insensitivity syndrome, one kind of testicular feminization in which the external genitalia develop the female phenotype, and the wolfian and müllerian ducts regress (Box 53-3).

DHT Formation In certain target tissues, cytoplasmic $5 \alpha$-reductase converts testosterone to DHT (see Fig. 54-6), which binds to the same AR as does testosterone. However, DHT binds to AR with an affinity that is $\sim 100$-fold greater than the binding of testosterone. Moreover, the DHT-AR complex binds to DNA targets more tightly than does the testosterone-receptor complex. Thus, a relatively low circulating level of testosterone-not enough to produce secondary masculinization-can profoundly affect cells of the urogenital sinus that express AR and $5 \alpha$-reductase. Conversely, a deficiency in $5 \alpha$-reductase is another cause of testicular feminization (see Box 53-3). (T) NS3-2

Antimüllerian Hormone As noted on page 1080, the Sertoli cells of the testis produce AMH, which promotes the regression of müllerian ducts. The cranial end of the müllerian duct becomes the vestigial appendix testis at the superior pole of the testis. The müllerian ducts are responsive to AMH at around the eighth week of development and undergo apoptosis in a craniocaudal direction. The ducts completely regress within 1 week of exposure to AMH. AMH deficiency in males, which is usually caused by mutations in the genes

## BOX 53-3 Impaired Androgen Action in Target Tissues

In the absence of androgens, male embryos follow a typically female pattern of sexual development. Any defect in the mechanisms by which androgens act on target tissues-in genotypic males-may lead to a DSD (see Box 53-2) that had been referred to as male pseudohermaphroditism. Affected individuals have a normal male karyotype $(46, X Y)$ and unambiguous male gonads but may have ambiguous external genitalia or may phenotypically appear as females. In principle, impaired androgen action could result from a deficiency of the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT in target tissues, absence of androgen receptors, qualitatively abnormal receptors, a quantitative deficiency in receptor levels, or postreceptor defects. The two major forms that have been identified clinically are defects in the conversion of testosterone to DHT ( $5 \alpha$-reductase deficiency) (T) NS3-5 and androgen-receptor defects. (T) NS3-6

A classic example of pseudohermaphroditism is a condition known as quevedoces (Dominican Spanish slang for penis at 12), first identified is isolated villages of the Dominican Republic in the 1970s. In those communities, $\sim 2 \%$ of children who appear as girls at birth and through childhood undergo a remarkable masculinization at puberty. They do not develop breasts or menstruate, but instead become male: the clitoris enlarges to the size of a normal penis and is capable of an erection; the hitherto unrecognized and fully developed testes descend into their labia majora; the individual is capable of ejaculation of mature sperm, albeit through a urethral opening at the base of the enlarged clitoris/penis; and the individuals develop typical male secondary sexual characteristics, including facial hair, increased muscle growth, and a sexual attraction to females. These individuals are actually 46,XY males. At birth they have undescended testes, developed wolffian duct derivatives, no müllerian duct structures, but normal female external genitalia. They appear female at birth and through childhood because they have a $5 \alpha$-reductase deficiency and, thus, insufficient androgen to masculinize the tissues of the urogenital sinus. The sudden masculinization at puberty is due to increased testosterone levels, which become high enough to exert androgenic action on the genital tubercle and urogenital sinus. These individuals spend the rest of their lives as men.
encoding AMH or its receptor, can lead to persistent müllerian duct syndrome. These males have undescended testes and a small rudimentary uterus and other müllerian-duct derivatives. AMH also appears to be involved in the regulation of sex hormone (testosterone and estradiol) production as well as in puberty and gender-specific behaviors in both sexes via targets in the brain.

## Androgens direct the male pattern of sexual differentiation of the internal ducts, the urogenital sinus, and the external genitalia

Androgens play two major roles in male phenotypic differentiation: (1) they trigger conversion of the wolffian ducts to the male ejaculatory system, and (2) they direct the differentiation of the urogenital sinus and external genitalia. The wolffian phase of male sexual differentiation is regulated

## N53-5 5 $\alpha$-Reductase Deficiency

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

The activity of $5 \alpha$-reductase, which is necessary for the conversion of testosterone to DHT (see Fig. 54-6), is either low or absent in fibroblasts taken from the genital region and other tissues of individuals with one form of DSD (see Box 53-2). The testosterone concentration is either normal or increased. On the other hand, the concentration of DHT is low, which explains why testosterone-dependent development (e.g., differentiation of the wolffian duct) occurs whereas DHTdependent development (e.g., male-pattern development of the urogenital sinus and external genitalia) does not. This disorder is transmitted via an autosomal recessive gene that is phenotypically manifested only in genetic males. At birth, these children have ambiguous genitalia, with a blind vaginal pouch and a small phallus that is bound ventrally and covered by a hood; they also have hypospadias (i.e., the urethral orifice is located too low on the undersurface of the penis). Wolffian duct development (which depends on testosterone) occurs, and müllerian regression (which depends on AMH) is normal. These individuals may be raised as females.

At the time of puberty, marked, though selective, virilization occurs. The testes descend from their intra-abdominal position. These individuals also undergo other signs of masculinization, including deepening of the voice, muscular development, and phallic enlargement. The cause of virilization at puberty in these individuals is unknown. However, it may be that the large quantities of testosterone produced at puberty are able to sufficiently stimulate androgen receptors in DHTdependent tissues or that even relatively low levels of $5 \alpha$-reductase activity are able to generate sufficient DHT in the presence of high levels of substrate (i.e., testosterone). However, masculine features that depend on DHT-such as beard growth, acne, and temporal balding-fail to occur.

## N53-2 DHT and Intracrine Control of Hormone Action

## Contributed by Sam Mesiano

Steroid hormone activity in some target cells is modified by specific enzymes that convert the incoming steroid to a more or less active form before it interacts with its cognate receptor. This is referred to as intracrine control of hormone action. In some androgen-responsive cells the cytoplasmic $5 \alpha$-reductase enzyme converts testosterone to DHT (see Fig. 54-6), which binds to the same AR as testosterone but with a much higher affinity, $\sim 100$-fold greater than testosterone. Moreover, the DHT-AR complex binds to DNA targets more tightly than does the testosterone-AR complex. Thus, androgen target cells have the capacity to markedly increase the potency of testosterone by converting it to DHT. Via this mechanism a relatively low circulating level of testosterone that is not enough to produce secondary masculinization can have a profound effect on cells of the urogenital sinus that express AR and the $5 \alpha$-reductase enzyme.

Other examples of intracrine effects are the intracellular conversion by 11 B -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 of the active cortisol to the inactive cortisone in principal cells of the cortical collecting duct (see p. 766) and the conversion of the less-active thyroxine $\left(T_{4}\right)$ to the more-active triiodothyronine $\left(T_{3}\right)$ by deiodinase in many targets of thyroid hormones (see pp. 1009-1010).

## N53-6 Androgen-Receptor Defects

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Individuals with complete androgen resistance (also known as androgen insensitivity syndrome or testicular feminization) have normal levels of testosterone and DHT. Moreover, the pathways of testosterone metabolism (see Fig. 54-6) and half-life are normal. However, androgen receptors are defective or absent. As a result, either androgens do not bind to receptors at high levels, or the androgen-receptor complex does not bind properly to DNA. Because target cells behave as though androgens were not present at all, androgendependent sexual development does not occur. As a result, the wolffian ducts degenerate, and the urogenital sinus and external genitalia all develop according to the female pattern. However, the normal levels of AMH suppress müllerian development. Although a rudimentary uterus and fallopian tubes are sometimes found, their growth and development have obviously been inhibited.

The term testicular feminization, which is no longer used, was introduced by J.M. Morris in 1953 to describe a group of patients with a distinctive form of male pseudohermaphroditism. This X-linked disorder has a prevalence of 1 in 20,000 live male births. These individuals are genetic malestheir sex chromosome complex is XY-but phenotypic females. They appear normal at birth with the exception of the presence of an inguinal hernia. The testis is either intraabdominal, located in an inguinal hernia, or in the labia majora. They have unambiguous female external genitalia. However, the labia majora are underdeveloped, the vagina is shallow and ends blindly, and the uterus is at most rudimentary. The clitoris is normal or small. Development and growth of individuals with complete androgen resistance usually follow the normal female pattern. At puberty, breast development occurs at the expected time. However, these individuals have a significant deficiency or total lack of pubic and axillary hair and fail to menstruate.

by testosterone itself and does not require conversion of testosterone to DHT. In contrast, virilization of the urogenital sinus, the prostate, the penile urethra, and the external genitalia during embryogenesis requires DHT, as does sexual maturation at puberty.

Differentiation of the Duct System Shortly after the Sertoli cells initiate AMH production, the fetal Leydig cells begin producing testosterone. The embryonic mesenchyme contains androgen receptors and is the first site of androgen action during formation of the male urogenital tract. The Sertoli cells also produce a substance referred to as androgenbinding protein (ABP). It is possible that ABP binds and maintains a high concentration of testosterone locally. These high local levels of testosterone stimulate growth and differentiation of the medulla of the gonad into the rete testes, as well as differentiation of the wolfian ducts into the epididymis, the vas deferens, the seminal vesicles, and the ejaculatory duct. Testosterone also promotes development of the prostate from a series of endodermal buds located at the proximal aspect of the urethra. In the absence of testosterone, the wolfian system remains rudimentary, and normal male internal ductal development does not occur. Cells of the wolfian ducts lack $5 \alpha$-reductase and therefore cannot convert testosterone to DHT. Thus, the internal male ducts respond to testosterone per se and do not require the conversion of testosterone to DHT.

Differentiation of the Urogenital Sinus and External Genitalia Development of the male external genitalia and internal derivatives of the urogenital sinus (prostate and bulbourethral glands) commences at around the 9th week of gestation-all under the influence of DHT-soon after maturation of the wolfian ducts and is completed by 13th week of gestation. If androgens are absent (in females, or in males in which androgen production or action is disrupted) the indifferent external genitalia remain unfused and follow the female pattern of differentiation. In female fetuses exposed to abnormally high levels of extragonadal androgens (e.g., in congenital adrenal hyperplasia; Box 53-4) virilization of the urogenital sinus occurs; the extent of the virilization is more pronounced the earlier in development the exposure occurs. Once the labioscrotal swellings have established the female form, androgen-induced virilization affects mainly the size of the clitoris. However, if androgen exposure occurs earlier in development, partial fusion of the labioscrotal swellings can occur. The cells of the urogenital sinus and external genitalia, unlike those of the wolfian duct, contain $5 \alpha$-reductase and are thus capable of converting testosterone to DHT. Indeed, conversion of testosterone to DHT is usually required for normal male development of the external genitalia.

In the presence of high intracellular concentrations of DHT, the genital tubercle, the bipotential predecessor to either a clitoris or a penis, elongates to become the glans penis, the corpus spongiosum, and the two corpora cavernosa. Formation of the penis and scrotum is complete by $\sim 13$ weeks of gestation. Congenital absence of $5 \alpha$-reductase (see Box 53-3) is associated with normal development of the wolfian duct system but impaired virilization of the external genitalia. Even extremely high concentrations of testosterone

## BOX 53-4 Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia

Ambiguous genitalia in genotypic females may result from disorders of adrenal function. Several forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia have been described, including the deficiency of several enzymes involved in steroid synthesis (see Fig. 50-2): the side-chain-cleavage enzyme, $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase, $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase, $11 \beta$-hydroxylase, and $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Deficiencies in $21 \alpha$ hydroxylase, $11 \beta$-hydroxylase, and $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase all lead to virilization in females-and thus ambiguous genitalia-as a result of the hypersecretion of adrenal androgens. 21 $\alpha$-hydroxylase deficiency, by far the most common, accounts for $\sim 95 \%$ of cases. Some of the consequences of this deficiency are discussed in Box 50-2.

As indicated by Figure 50-2, $21 \alpha$-hydroxylase deficiency reduces the conversion of progesterone to 11deoxycorticosterone-which goes on to form aldosteroneand also reduces the conversion of $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol-which is the precursor of cortisol. As a result, adrenal steroid precursors are shunted into androgen pathways. Because negative feedback by cortisol to the hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (see Fig. 50-3) is lacking in the fetus, the adrenal gland experiences high levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which induce the production of the weak androgen DHEA by the fetal zone of the adrenal cortex. The abnormally high levels of DHEA interact with the androgen receptor in tissue of the urogenital sinus to induce masculinization. In female infants, the result is sometimes called the adrenogenital syndrome. The external genitalia are difficult to distinguish from male genitalia on visual inspection. The clitoris is enlarged and resembles a penis, and the labioscrotal folds are enlarged and fused and resemble a scrotum. The genitalia thus have a male phenotype in an otherwise normal female infant.
after this time fail to cause midline fusion of the urethral groove or scrotum, although the clitoris will enlarge.

In the absence of androgen secretion by the fetal testisor abnormal extragonadal sources-the indifferent external genitalia remain unfused and follow the female pattern of differentiation (Box 53-5).

## Androgens and estrogens influence sexual differentiation of the brain

Gonadal steroids influence the development of sexually dimorphic nuclei in the diencephalons of rodents and lower primates. However, androgens do not act directly on the hypothalamus and other areas of the brain having to do with sex behavior and control of gonadotropin secretion. Rather, aromatase-which catalyzes the formation of estrone and estradiol (see Fig. 55-8)-converts androgens to estrogens in the brain. Thus, androgens in the brain serve as prohormones for estrogens. Therefore, estrogens are derived from androgens that appear to masculinize sexually dimorphic nuclei directly in the brain. It is not clear why, in females, estrogens do not masculinize the brain.

Gonadal steroids affect sex behavior in both males and females. In rodents, lordosis behavior in females and mounting behavior in males is one example of sex behavior. An example of functional sexual dimorphism in the human brain is the manner in which gonadotropin is released.

# BOX 53-5 Androgen Dependence of Testicular Descent 

n preparation for descent, the testes enlarge. In addition, the mesonephric kidneys and wolffian (mesonephric) ducts atrophy. This process frees the testes for their future move down the posterior abdominal wall and across the abdomen to the deep inguinal rings. Testicular descent occurs in three phases during the last two thirds of gestation. During the first stage of testicular descent, rapid growth of the abdominopelvic region causes relative movement of the testes down to the inguinal region (Fig. 53-10A). The role of the gubernaculum-the ligament attaching the inferior part of the testis to the lower segment of the labioscrotal fold-is uncertain. However, the gubernaculum shortens and appears to guide the testis to its place of ultimate functional residence in the scrotum. The second stage of testicular descent is herniation of the abdominal wall adjacent to the gubernaculum (see Fig. 53-10B). This herniation, which occurs as a result of increasing abdominal pressure, forms the processus vaginalis; the processus vaginalis then folds around the gubernaculum and creates the inguinal canal. In the third stage, the
gubernaculum increases to the approximate diameter of the testis. As its proximal portion degenerates, the gubernaculum draws the testis into the scrotum through the processus vaginalis (see Fig. 53-10C).

The testes usually complete their descent by the seventh month of gestation; $\sim 97.5 \%$ of full-term infants and $79 \%$ of premature infants have fully descended testes at birth. At 9 months of age, only $0.8 \%$ of male infants have undescended testes. The incidence of undescended testes in young men is $0.2 \%$.

Testicular descent is an androgen-dependent process, and development of the structures involved in testicular descent depends on testosterone. Thus, in testosterone-deficient states caused by inadequate secretion or disordered androgen action, the testes of genetic males often fail to descend. This abnormality can be seen in individuals with both $5 \alpha$-reductase deficiency and complete androgen resistance (i.e., testicular feminization syndrome).

Figure 53-10 Testicular descent.

Gonadotropin release has been described as cyclic in the female and tonic in the male inasmuch as females have midcycle cyclic release of gonadotropin before ovulation whereas males seem to have a continuous tonic pattern of gonadotropin release.

Although controversy continues over the role of prenatal virilization in the determination of sexual dimorphism, sex steroids clearly have an impact on sexual behavior and sexual reference in humans.

## PUBERTY

Although at birth humans have the primary and secondary sex organs necessary for procreation, final sexual maturity occurs only at puberty, the transition between the juvenile and adult states when an individual becomes capable of reproducing.

## Puberty involves steroid hormones produced by the gonads and the adrenals

Puberty involves two physiological processes: (1) gonadarche, the physical and functional maturation of the gonads, such that they produce gametes and sex steroids; and (2) adrenarche, the increased production of the androgenic steroids dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and androstenedione (A4) by the adrenal cortex (see Fig. 50-2). Adrenarche is peculiar to humans and great apes and occurs in both sexes during the prepubertal period (ages 6 to 8 years). The increased levels of adrenal androgens induce pubarche, the growth of pubic hair. The function of adrenarche is unclear, inasmuch as its absence does not prevent gonadarche or the attainment of reproductive competence. The mechanisms that control the timing of adrenarche are also not known.

Gonadarche is induced by increased production of the gonadotropic hormones follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)

and luteinizing hormone (LH) by the anterior pituitary (see pp. 1094-1095 and 1111-1112). Although a surge in levels of the pituitary gonadotropins occurs during intrauterine life and a second peak takes place in the immediately postnatal period, gonadotropin levels decrease at $\sim 4$ months of age and thereafter decline further and remain low until just before puberty. At puberty, the marked increase in FSH and LH production by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis induces gonadarche. The gonadal steroids produced in response to FSH and LH induce growth and maturation of the genitals and secondary sex organs and the development of secondary sex characteristics. The gonadal steroids also participate (with growth hormone and insulin-like growth factors) in the adolescent growth spurt. In males gonadarche leads to spermarche, the initiation of sperm production by the testes (see p. 1092), and in females it leads to folliculogenesis and menarche, the initiation of menstrual cycles, and thelarche, development of breasts (see p. 1108).

## Hypothalamic gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion controls puberty

Gonadotropin production by the anterior pituitary is under the control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), produced by neurons in the hypothalamus (see pp. 10921094 and 1111). The activity of hypothalamic GnRH neurons is controlled by higher centers in the brain that integrate multiple physiological signals. One of the earliest events of puberty in males and females is the onset of pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and, in turn, FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary, during rapid eye movement sleep. These pulses eventually occur throughout the day (Fig. 53-11A). The appearance of GnRH pulsatility early in puberty is associated with decreased sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system to circulating sex steroids. The low GnRH and gonadotropin secretion during the prepubertal years appears to be due to high sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system to negative-feedback inhibition by gonadal steroids (see Fig. 53-11B). Before puberty, even low levels of sex steroids are sufficient to feed back on the hypothalamic-pituitary system and block the release of gonadotropins. After puberty, the levels of steroids required to block gonadotropin release progressively increase. Thus, the sensitivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary system to inhibition by sex steroids falls at puberty to reach the low level that is characteristic of the adult (see Fig. 53-11C). The precipitating event that is responsible for initiating pulsatile GnRH release is unknown, although it may reflect the maturation of hypothalamic neurons. Once a pulsatile pattern of gonadotropin secretion is established, it continues throughout reproductive life.

## Multiple factors control the timing of puberty

In girls, adrenarche leading to pubarche occurs between 8 and 13 years of age, and gonadarche leading to menarche and thelarche occurs between 12 and 13 years of age. The earliest physical manifestation of puberty in boys is an increase in testicular volume, which usually occurs between 9 and 14 years of age (Table 53-1).

The precise cause of the onset of puberty is not completely understood. Multiple intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors play a role. Genetic factors appear to be major determinants of pubertal onset. Other factors, such as nutrition, geographic location, and exposure to light, also play a role. Over the last century, the age of girls at menarche in the United States and Europe has gradually decreased. The reason that menarche now occurs at a younger age is incompletely understood. It could be due to improved nutrition. However, better nutritional status alone cannot completely explain the decreased age of pubertal onset. Proximity to the equator and lower altitudes are also associated with early onset of puberty. A loose correlation is also seen between the onset of menarche in the mother and the onset of menarche in the daughter. The onset of puberty is also related to body composition and to fat deposition. Severe obesity and heavy exercise delay puberty.

## Androgens and estrogens influence secondary sex characteristics at puberty

Profound alterations in steroid hormone secretion during the peripubertal period cause changes in the primary sex organs and secondary sex characteristics. In both sexes, the process of puberty can be divided into five developmental stages-referred to as the Tanner stages-based on the extent of pubic hair growth and genital and breast development. In males and females, Tanner stage 1 is the prepubertal state and Tanner stage 5 is the adult state (Fig. 53-12 and Table 53-1).

Males The range of onset of normal male puberty extends from 9 to 14 years. Boys complete pubertal development within 2 to $41 / 2$ years. In a normal male, the first sign of puberty (Tanner stage 2) is enlargement of the testes to $>2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ (see Fig. 53-12B). Testicular enlargement is mainly due to growth of the seminiferous tubules with some contribution by Leydig cell growth. (5) N53-3 In normal boys, pubic hair generally develops 1 to $11 / 2$ years after genital development. Pubic hair growth can be due to adrenarche or gonadarche and therefore can occur independently of genital growth.

The male sex steroids, which are known as androgens, affect nearly every tissue in the body, including the brain. The changes that occur in male puberty are induced mainly by testosterone secreted by the testes. Testosterone stimulates adult maturation of the external genitalia and accessory sex organs, including the penis, the scrotum, the prostate, and the seminal vesicles. It also induces the male secondary sexual characteristics, which include deepening of the voice, as well as evolving male patterns of hair growth. (5) N53-4 Testosterone also has anabolic effects, including stimulation of linear body growth, nitrogen retention, and muscular development in the adolescent and mature male. The biological effects of testosterone and its metabolites can be classified according to their tissue sites of action. Effects that relate to growth of the male reproductive tract or development of secondary sexual characteristics are referred to as androgenic, whereas the growth-promoting effects on somatic tissue are called anabolic.

## N53-3 Testicular Size

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Testicular size is generally determined using a ruler or calipers. It is expected that a length of $>2.5 \mathrm{~cm}$ is compatible with the onset of normal pubertal development. The testicular volume index is defined as the sum of the product of length $\times$ width for the left and right testes. An orchidometer allows direct comparison of the patient's testes with an ovoid of measured volume. A popular method uses the Prader orchidometer, a set of solid or hollow ovoids encompassing the range of sizes from infancy to adulthood ( 1 to 25 mL ). The volumes of the testes are then recorded; a volume of 3 mL closely correlates with the onset of pubertal development.

## N53-4 Male Secondary Sex Characteristics: Voice and Hair Patterns

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Androgens also determine the male secondary sexual characteristics, which include deepening of the voice as well as evolving male patterns of hair growth. The changes in the voice are a result of androgen-dependent effects on the size of the larynx as well as the length and thickness of the vocal cords. In boys, the length of the vocal cords increases by $\sim 50 \%$ during puberty, whereas girls have little increase in vocal cord length. The surfaces of the human body that bear secondary sexual hair include the face (particularly the upper lip, chin, and the sideburn areas), the axilla, and the pubic region. Temporal hair recession and male-pattern baldingbeginning above the temples (i.e., receding hairline) and at the vertex of the scalp-are also androgen-dependent phenomena.

Figure 53-12 Tanner stages of puberty based on pubic hair, genital, and breast development in boys and girls. Pubic hair and genital/breast development may not be synchronous and are usually scored separately. For example, a girl may be at breast stage 3 but pubic hair stage 2. (Data from Carel JC, Léger J: Clinical practice. Precocious puberty. N Engl J Med 358:2366, 2008.)

The pubertal growth spurt, a marked increase in growth rate (total body size), occurs late in puberty in boys. The acceleration of growth appears due to the combined effects of increased secretion of growth hormone and testosterone. In boys, height increases by an average of 28 cm during the pubertal spurt. The $10-\mathrm{cm}$ mean difference in adult stature between men and women is due to a greater pubertal growth spurt in boys and to greater height at the onset of peak pubertal height velocity in boys compared with girls. Before puberty, boys and girls have the same mean body mass, skeletal mass, and body fat. However, men have $150 \%$ of the average woman's lean and skeletal body mass, and women have $200 \%$ of the body fat of men. Men have twice
the number of muscle cells of women, and 1.5 times the muscle mass.

Females The first physical sign of puberty in girls is usually the onset of thelarche that begins between 10 and 11 years of age (see Fig. 53-12A). During the next 3 to 5 years, the breasts continue to develop under the influence of several hormones. Progesterone is primarily responsible for development of the alveoli (see Fig. 56-11C). Estrogen is the primary stimulus for development of the duct system that connects the alveoli to the exterior. Insulin, growth hormone, glucocorticoids, and thyroxin contribute to breast development, but they are incapable of causing breast growth by themselves.

During puberty, the uterus and cervix enlarge, and their secretory functions increase under the influence of estrogens (mainly estradiol). The uterine glands increase in number and length, and the endometrium and stroma proliferate in response to estrogens. The mucous membranes of the female urogenital tract respond to hormones, particularly estrogens.

Menarche usually occurs around 2 years after the initiation of thelarche. In the United States, most girls experience menarche between the ages of 11 and 13 years, the average age is 12.5 years, and the normal range is between 8 and 16 years. During puberty, a girl's body shape changes in response to rising levels of estradiol. The hips and pelvis widen and the proportion of body fat increases (compared with males) and distributes mainly to the breasts, hips, buttocks, thighs, upper arms, and pubis to produce the typical adult female body shape.

## The appearance of secondary sex characteristics at puberty completes sexual differentiation and development

Although at birth humans have the primary and secondary sex organs necessary for procreation, final sexual maturity occurs only at puberty. Profound alterations in hormone secretion during the peripubertal period cause changes in the primary and secondary sex organs. In the following chapters the events occurring in puberty are discussed in more detail for both males (see Chapter 54) and females (see Chapter 55).

# THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 

Sam Mesiano and Ervin E. Jones

The male reproductive system consists of two essential elements: the gonads (in this case the testes) and the complex array of glands and ducts that constitute the sex accessory organs (Fig. 54-1A, B).

The testes are responsible for the production of gametes, the haploid cells-spermatozoa, plural of spermatozoonecessary for sexual reproduction and for the synthesis and secretion of hormones, including the principal male sex hormone, testosterone. These hormones are necessary for functional conditioning of the sex organs, the male secondary sexual characteristics, feedback control of gonadotropin secretion, and modulation of sexual behavior.

The testes (see Fig. 54-1C) are composed mainly of seminiferous tubules (see Fig. 54-1D, E) and interstitial cells of Leydig, located in the spaces between the tubules. A seminiferous tubule is an epithelium made up of Sertoli cells (see Fig. 54-1E) and is also the site of spermatogenesisthe production of the haploid spermatozoa from the diploid germ cells. The seminiferous epithelium rests on a basement membrane, itself supported by a thin lamina propria externa.

The male sex accessory organs include the paired epididymides, the vas deferens, the seminal vesicles, the ejaculatory ducts, the prostate, the bulbourethral glands (Cowper's glands), the urethra, and the penis. The primary role of the male sex accessory glands and ducts is to store and transport spermatozoa to the exterior, and thus enable spermatozoa to reach and fertilize female gametes.

## HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-GONADAL AXIS

The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Fig. 54-2) controls two primary functions: (1) production of gametes (spermatogenesis in males and oogenesis in females), and (2) gonadal sex steroid biosynthesis (testosterone in males and estradiol and progesterone in females). In both sexes, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary to secrete the two gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Although the names of these hormones reflect their function in the female reproductive system (see pp. 1111-1112) they play similar roles in controlling gonadal function in both sexes. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis is therefore the central regulator of male and female reproductive systems. In the
male, LH and FSH control, respectively, the Leydig and Sertoli cells of the testes.

## The hypothalamus secretes GnRH, which acts on gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which is synthesized by small-bodied peptidergic neurons in the hypothalamus, stimulates the synthesis, storage, and secretion of gonadotropins by gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary. The hypothalamic-pituitary-portal system (see p. 978) describes the route by which GnRH and other releasing hormones emanating from the hypothalamus reach the anterior pituitary gland. The neurons that synthesize, store, and release GnRH are dispersed throughout the hypothalamus but are principally located in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area. During embryonic development, GnRH neurons originate in the olfactory placode and migrate to the hypothalamus. Studies involving both rats and primates show that sites of GnRH production other than the hypothalamus (e.g., the limbic system) can also participate in the control of sex behavior. Neuronal systems originating from other areas of the brain impinge on the hypothalamic GnRH-releasing neurons and thus form a functional neuronal network that integrates multiple environmental signals (e.g., diurnal lightdark cycles) and physiological signals (e.g., extent of body fat stores, stress) to control GnRH release and, ultimately, the function of the reproductive system.

GnRH is a decapeptide hormone encoded by a single gene on chromosome 8. Like many other peptide hormones, GnRH is synthesized as a prohormone-69 amino acids long in this case. Cleavage of the prohormone yields the decapeptide GnRH (residues 1 to 10), a 56-amino-acid peptide (residues 14 to 69) referred to as GnRH-associated peptide (GAP), and three amino acids that link the two (Fig. 54-3). Via the secretory pathway (see p. 34), the neuron transports both GnRH and GAP down the axon for secretion into the extracellular space. The role of GAP is unknown.

GnRH neurons project axons directly to a small swelling on the inferior boundary of the hypothalamus, known as the median eminence, which lies above the pituitary stalk. The axons terminate near portal vessels that carry blood to the anterior pituitary (see p. 978). Consequently, GnRH secreted at the axon terminals in response to neuron activation enters the portal vasculature and is transported directly to gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary.

Figure 54-1 Anatomy of the male internal genitalia and accessory sex organs. A, The two major elements of the male sexual anatomy are the gonads (i.e., testes) and the sex accessories (i.e., epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, ejaculatory duct, prostate, bulbourethral or Cowper's glands, urethra, and penis). Note that the urethra can be subdivided into the prostatic urethra, the bulbous urethra, and the penile urethra. B, The vas deferens expands into an ampulla before coursing across the rear of the urinary bladder and merging with the outflow from the seminal vesicle. The merger forms the ejaculatory duct. The left and right ejaculatory ducts penetrate the prostate gland and open into the prostatic urethra. C, The spermatozoa form in the seminiferous tubules and then flow into the rete testis and from there into the efferent ductules, the epididymis, and the vas deferens. E, The seminiferous tubule is an epithelium formed by Sertoli cells, with interspersed germ cells. The most immature germ cells (the spermatogonia) are near the periphery of the tubule, whereas the mature germ cells (the spermatozoa) are near the lumen of the tubule. The Leydig cells are interstitial cells that lie between the tubules.

Figure 54-2 Hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Small-bodied neurons in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus secrete GnRH, a decapeptide that reaches the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary via the long portal veins (see Fig. 47-3). Stimulation by GnRH causes the gonadotrophs to synthesize and release LH, which stimulates Leydig cells, and FSH, which stimulates Sertoli cells. Negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis occurs by two routes. CNS, central nervous system.

GnRH stimulates the release of both FSH and LH from the gonadotroph cells in the anterior pituitary by interacting with high-affinity membrane receptors on the gonadotroph cell surface (see Fig. 55-5). The GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is a G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR; see pp. 51-52) linked to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{g}$, which activates phospholipase C (PLC; see p. 58). PLC acts on membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphates $\left(\mathrm{PIP}_{2}\right)$ to liberate inositol

Figure 54-3 Map of the GnRH gene. The mature mRNA encodes a preprohormone with 92 amino acids. Removal of the 23-amino-acid signal sequence yields the 69-amino-acid prohormone. Cleavage of this prohormone yields GnRH. AA, amino acid.

1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG). $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ stimulates the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from internal stores, which triggers exocytosis LH and FSH. DAG stimulates protein kinase C, which indirectly increases expression of genes encoding LH and FSH. The net effect is an increase in the synthesis and release of LH and FSH from the gonadotrophs. Because secretion of GnRH into the portal system is pulsatile, secretion of LH and FSH by the gonadotrophs is also episodic. The frequency of pulsatile LH discharge in men is $\sim 8$ to 14 pulses over a 24 -hour period. FSH pulses are not as prominent as LH pulses, both because of their lower amplitude and because of the longer half-life of FSH in the circulation.

Upon binding GnRH, the GnRH receptor is internalized and partially degraded in the lysosomes. However, some GnRH receptors are shuttled back to the cell surface, and de novo receptor synthesis continues from GnRH receptor gene expression. Return of the GnRH receptor to the cell membrane is referred to as receptor replenishment. A consequence of receptor internalization, however, is that the responsiveness of gonadotrophs to GnRH can be decreased by prolonged exposure to GnRH. Thus, although pulsatile GnRH discharge elicits a corresponding pulsatile release of LH and FSH, continuous administration of GnRH-or intermittent administration of high doses of GnRH analogssuppresses the release of gonadotropins. This effect occurs because continuous (rather than pulsatile) exposure to GnRH causes a decrease in the number of GnRH receptors on the surface of the gonadotroph (i.e., receptor internalization exceeds replenishment). The induced desensitization to GnRH can be used therapeutically to control the reproductive function. A clinical application of this principle is chemical castration in prostatic cancer. Here, the administration of long-acting GnRH analogs desensitize the gonadotrophs to GnRH, which leads to low LH and FSH levels and thereby reduces testosterone production (see Box 55-2).

## Under the control of GnRH, gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary secrete LH and FSH

Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) are members of the same family of hormones as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; see p. 1139) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH; see p. 1010). These glycoprotein hormones are composed of two polypeptide chains designated $\alpha$ and $\beta$, both of which are required for full biological activity. The $\alpha$ subunits of LH and FSH, as well as the $\alpha$ subunits of hCG and TSH, are identical. In humans, the common $\alpha$ subunit has 92 amino acids and a molecular

weight of $\sim 20 \mathrm{kDa}$. The $\beta$ subunits differ among these four hormones and thus confer specific functional and immunological characteristics to the intact molecules.

Each of the unique $\beta$ subunits of FSH and LH is 115 amino acids in length. The $\beta$ subunits of LH and hCG are identical except that the $\beta$ subunit of hCG has an additional 24 amino acids and additional glycosylation sites at the C terminus. (5) NS4-1 The biological activities of LH and hCG are very similar. Indeed, in most clinical uses (e.g., in an attempt to initiate spermatogenesis in oligospermic men), hCG is substituted for LH because hCG is much more readily available. (5) NS4-2

Differential secretion of FSH and LH is affected by several other hormonal mediators, including sex steroids, inhibins, and activins (see pp. 1113-1115). Thus, depending on the specific hormonal milieu produced by different physiological circumstances, the gonadotroph produces the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of FSH and LH at different rates.

The specific gonadotropin and the relative proportions of each gonadotropin released from the anterior pituitary depend on the developmental age. The pituitary gland of the male fetus contains functional gonadotrophs by the end of the first trimester of gestation. Thereafter, gonadotropin secretion rises rapidly and then plateaus. Gonadotropin secretion begins to decline in utero during late fetal life and increases again during the early postnatal period.

Male primates release LH in response to GnRH administration at 1 to 3 months of age, a finding indicative of functional competence of the anterior pituitary gland. Also during this time, a short-lived postnatal surge of LH and testosterone secretion occurs in males. Although the cause of this short-lived surge of gonadotropins remains to be understood, it is clearly independent of sex steroids. The sensitivity of the gonadotrophs to stimulation subsequently diminishes, and the system remains quiescent until just before puberty.

Release of FSH is greater than that of LH during the prepubertal period, a pattern that is reversed after puberty. GnRH preferentially triggers LH release in men. This preferential release of LH may reflect maturation of the testes, which secrete inhibins, a specific inhibitor of FSH secretion at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. Increased sensitivity of the pituitary to increasing gonadal steroid production may also be responsible for the diminished secretion of FSH.

## LH stimulates the Leydig cells of the testis to produce testosterone

LH derives its name from effects observed in the female, that is, from the ability to stimulate ovulation and the formation and maintenance of the corpus luteum (see p. 1116). The comparable substance in the male was originally referred to as interstitial cell-stimulating hormone (ICSH). Subsequently, investigators realized that LH and ICSH are the same substance, and the common name became LH.

LH stimulates the synthesis of testosterone by the testes. Testosterone production decreases in males after hypophysectomy. Conversely, LH (or hCG) treatment of men increases testosterone levels, but only if the testes are intact and functional. The interstitial Leydig cells are the principal
targets for LH and the primary source of testosterone production in the male. The plasma membranes of Leydig cells have a high-affinity LH receptor, a GPCR coupled to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ (Fig. 54-4). Binding of LH to this receptor activates membrane-bound adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53), which catalyzes the formation of cAMP, which in turn activates protein kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA modulates gene transcription (see Fig. 4-13) and increases the synthesis of enzymes and other proteins necessary for the biosynthesis of testosterone (see pp. 1097-1100).

## FSH stimulates Sertoli cells to synthesize hormones that influence Leydig cells and spermatogenesis

The Sertoli cells are the primary testicular site of FSH action (see Fig. 54-4). FSH also regulates Leydig cell physiology via effects on Sertoli cells. The signaling events after FSH binding are similar to those described above for LH on the Leydig cell. Thus, binding of FSH to a GPCR activates $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$, causing stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, an increase in [cAMP] ${ }_{i}$, stimulation of PKA, transcription of specific genes, and increased protein synthesis. These proteins are important for synthesis and action of steroid hormones, including the following:

1. Androgen-binding protein (ABP), which is secreted into the luminal space of the seminiferous tubule, near the developing sperm cells. ABP helps to keep local testosterone levels high.
2. P-450 aromatase (P-450 ${ }_{\text {arom }}$ ) see p. 1117 and Table 50-2), a key steroidogenic enzyme that converts testosterone, which diffuses from the Leydig cells to the Sertoli cells, into estradiol.
3. Growth factors and other products that support sperm cells and spermatogenesis. These substances significantly increase the number of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids in the testis. The stimulatory effect of FSH on spermatogenesis is not a direct action of FSH on the spermatogonia; instead, stimulation of spermatogenesis occurs via the action of FSH on Sertoli cells. FSH may also increase the fertility potential of sperm; it appears that this effect of FSH results from stimulation of motility, rather than from an increase in the absolute number of sperm.
4. Inhibins, which exert negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis to inhibit FSH secretion (see below). Inhibins are members of the transforming growth factor- $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) superfamily, which also includes the activins and antimüllerian hormone (see p. 1080). Inhibins are glycoprotein heterodimers consisting of one $\alpha$ and one $\beta$ subunit that are covalently linked. The granulosa cells in the ovary and the Sertoli cells in the testis are the primary sources of inhibins. We discuss the biology of inhibins and activins in more detail on pages 1113-1115. Inhibins are secreted into the seminiferous tubule fluid and into the interstitial fluid of the testicle. In addition to exerting an endocrine effect on the axis, inhibins also have paracrine effects, acting as growth factors on Leydig cells.

Leydig cells and Sertoli cells engage in crosstalk (see Fig. 54-4). For example, the Leydig cells make testosterone,

hCG is secreted by the placenta, and some reports have described that small amounts of this substance are made in the testes, pituitary gland, and other nonplacental tissues.
hCG appears in the urine of pregnant women about 12 to 14 days after conception-the basis for pregnancy tests. In former times, hCG was extracted from the urine of pregnant women.

The disappearance of exogenous LH from the circulation is independent of gonadal function and follows a dual exponential time course. The half-life of the fast component is 40 minutes and that of the slow component is 120 minutes. Because of its increased glycosylation, hCG has an even longer half-life. FSH has a slower turnover rate; its disappearance from the blood is described by two exponentials with half-lives of about 4 hours and 3 days, respectively.

Figure 54-4 Leydig and Sertoli cell physiology. The Leydig cell (left) has receptors for LH. The binding of LH increases testosterone synthesis. The Sertoli cell (right) has receptors for FSH. (Useful mnemonics: $L$ for LH and Leydig, $S$ for FSH and Sertoli.) FSH promotes the synthesis of androgen-binding protein (ABP), aromatase, growth factors, and inhibin. There is crosstalk between Leydig cells and Sertoli cells. The Leydig cells make testosterone, which acts on Sertoli cells. Conversely, the Sertoli cells convert some of this testosterone to estradiol (because of the presence of aromatase), which can act on the Leydig cells. Sertoli cells also generate growth factors that act on the Leydig cells.
which acts on Sertoli cells. In the rat, $\beta$ endorphin produced by fetal Leydig cells binds to opiate receptors in Sertoli cells and inhibits their proliferation. Synthesis of $\beta$ endorphins could represent a local feedback mechanism by which Leydig cells constrain the number of Sertoli cells. Conversely, Sertoli cells affect Leydig cells. For example, Sertoli cells convert testosterone-manufactured by Leydig cells-to estradiol, which decreases the capacity of Leydig cells to produce testosterone in response to LH. In addition, FSH acting on Sertoli cells produces growth factors that may increase the number of LH receptors on Leydig cells during development and thus result in an increase in steroidogenesis (i.e., an increase in testosterone production).

What, then, is required for optimal spermatogenesis to occur? It appears that two testicular cell types (Leydig cells and Sertoli cells) are required, as well as two gonadotropins (LH and FSH) and one androgen (testosterone). First, LH and Leydig cells are required to produce testosterone. Thus, LH, or rather its substitute hCG, is used therapeutically to initiate spermatogenesis in azoospermic or oligospermic men. Second, FSH and Sertoli cells are important for the nursing of developing sperm cells and for the production of inhibin and growth factors, which affect the Leydig cells. Thus, FSH plays a primary role in regulating development of the appropriate number of the Leydig cells so that adequate testosterone levels are available for spermatogenesis and the development of secondary sex characteristics.

During early puberty in boys, both FSH and LH levels increase while, simultaneously, the Leydig cells proliferate and plasma levels of testosterone increase (Fig. 54-5). (3) NS4-3

## The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis is under feedback inhibition by testicular steroids and inhibins

The hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis in postpubertal males not only induces production of testosterone and inhibin by the testes but also receives negative feedback from these substances (see Fig. 54-2).

Normal circulating levels of testosterone inhibit the pulsatile release of GnRH by the hypothalamus and thereby

# N54-3 Effects of Follicle-Stimulating Hormone on Leydig and Sertoli Cells during Puberty 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

As noted in the upper panel of eFigure 54-1, both FSH and LH levels increase during early puberty in boys, while simultaneously the Leydig cells proliferate. As a result, the Leydig cells increase their production of testosterone, and plasma levels of this steroid hormone increase, as shown in the lower panel of eFigure 54-1.

The primary target of FSH in the testis is the Sertoli cell (see Fig. 54-4). Via this action on Sertoli cells, FSH indirectly increases the number of Leydig cells, which is a key part of pubertal development. In hypogonadotropic-hypogonadal men (i.e., individuals who have decreased levels of both LH and FSH), treating with exogenous FSH stimulates the Sertoli cells to release factors that induce differentiation and maturation of Leydig cells.

Subsequent treatment with hCG (i.e., which acts like LH) acts on these Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone and thereby support spermatogenesis.

During puberty, a related change is that Sertoli cells become relatively less sensitive to FSH, but at the same time they become more dependent on the testosterone that the Leydig cells produce. Thus, there is a continuum in the development of the Sertoli cells: as proliferation and maturation of the Sertoli cells proceeds during puberty, the responsiveness of the Sertoli cell to FSH declines while its responsiveness to testosterone increases. The mechanism for this switch appears to be that FSH stimulates the synthesis of androgen receptors on Sertoli cells.

The upper panel shows how plasma levels of biologically active LH and FSH increase during puberty, expressed in terms of both the stages of puberty and bone age. The lower panel shows the concomitant rise in plasma levels of testosterone. LH stimulates Leydig cells to synthesize testosterone. FSH indirectly promotes testosterone synthesis by stimulating the Sertoli cells to produce factors that act on Leydig cells.

reduce the frequency and amplitude of the LH- and FSHsecretory pulses. Testosterone also has negative-feedback action on LH secretion at the level of the pituitary gonadotrophs.

The inhibins also feed back on FSH secretion. Evidence for such negative feedback is that plasma FSH concentrations increase in proportion to the loss of germinal elements in the testis. Thus, FSH specifically stimulates the Sertoli cells to produce inhibin, and inhibin "inhibits" FSH secretion. Inhibin appears to diminish FSH secretion by acting at the level of the anterior pituitary rather than the hypothalamus.

The secretion of LH and FSH is under the additional control of neuropeptides, amino acids such as aspartate, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and endogenous opioids.

## TESTOSTERONE

## Leydig cells convert cholesterol to testosterone

Cholesterol is the obligate precursor for androgens and other testicular steroids. The Leydig cell can synthesize cholesterol de novo from acetyl coenzyme A or can take it up as low-density lipoproteins from the extracellular fluid by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42). The two sources appear to be equally important in humans.

Preceding the metabolism of cholesterol is the translocation of this precursor to the mitochondrial inner membrane, which requires two proteins. The first is sterol-carrier protein 2 (SCP-2), a $13.5-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein that translocates cholesterol from the plasma or organellar membranes to other organellar membranes, including the outer mitochondrial membrane. The second protein is the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR), which belongs to a large family of proteins involved in lipid trafficking and metabolism. The $37-\mathrm{kDa}$ pro-StAR protein-the precursor to StAR-ferries cholesterol from the endoplasmic reticulum to the outer mitochondrial membrane. The $30-\mathrm{kDa}$ mature StAR protein resides in the mitochondrial intermembrane space and extracts cholesterol from the mitochondrial outer membrane and ferries it across to the mitochondrial inner membrane.

The Leydig cell uses a series of five enzymes to convert cholesterol to testosterone. Three of these enzymes are $\mathbf{P} \mathbf{- 4 5 0}$ enzymes (see Table 50-2). 054-4 As summarized in Figure 54-6, because $3 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $3 \beta$ HSD) can oxidize the A ring of four intermediates, testosterone synthesis from cholesterol can take four pathways. The following is the "preferred" pathway:

1. Cholesterol conversion to pregnenolone. The pathway for testosterone synthesis begins in the mitochondrial inner membrane, where the cytochrome P-450 side-chain-cleavage enzyme ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{\mathrm{SCC}}$ also called 20,22desmolase) 054-4 removes the long side chain (carbons 22 to 27 ) from the carbon at position 20 of the cholesterol molecule ( 27 carbon atoms), yielding pregnenolone ( 21 carbon atoms). This reaction is the ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of testosterone, as it is for other steroid hormones. LH stimulates this reaction in the Leydig cell in two ways. First, LH increases the affinity of $\mathrm{P}-450_{\text {SCC }}$ for cholesterol. Second, LH has
long-term actions of increasing the levels of SCP-2, StAR, and $\mathrm{P}-450_{\text {SCC }}$ via PKA-stimulated gene transcription.
2. Pregnenolone conversion to $17 \alpha$-hydroxypregnenolone. In the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER), $17 \alpha$ hydroxylase (P-450 ${ }_{117}$ ) 054-4 then adds a hydroxyl group at position 17 to form $17 \alpha$-hydroxypregnenolone. P-450 ${ }_{117}$, a key branch-point enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway, also converts progesterone to $17 \alpha$ hydroxyprogesterone (see Fig. 54-6, middle column).
3. $17 \alpha$-hydroxypregnenolone conversion to dehydroepiandrosterone. In the SER, the 17,20-desmolase (a different activity of the same $\mathrm{P}-450_{117}$ whose $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase activity catalyzes the previous step) removes the position-20 side chain from position 17 of $17 \alpha$ hydroxypregnenolone, producing a 19-carbon steroid called dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). This so-called delta-5 pathway on the left of Figure 54-6 is the preferred route in Leydig cells to yield DHEA, the precursor for all sex steroids.
4. DHEA conversion to androstenediol. In the SER of the Leydig cell, a $17 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $17 \beta$ HSD, which is not a P-450 enzyme) converts the ketone at position 17 of DHEA to a hydroxyl group to form androstenediol.
5. Androstenediol conversion to testosterone. Finally, in the SER, $3 \beta$-HSD (not a P-450 enzyme) oxidizes the hydroxyl group of androstenediol at position 3 of the A ring to a ketone, forming testosterone. 054-5

In addition, the testis can also use $5 \alpha$-reductase, which is located in the SER, to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). However, extratesticular tissue is responsible for most of the production of DHT. The conversion of testosterone to DHT is especially important in certain testosterone target cells (see pp. 1097-1099).

The Leydig cells of the testes make $\sim 95 \%$ of the circulating testosterone. Although testosterone is the major secretory product, the testes also secretes pregnenolone, progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, androsterone, and DHT. The conversion of testosterone to DHT by Leydig cells is minor compared with its production in certain testosterone target cells (see p. 1085). Androstenedione is of major importance because it serves as a precursor for extraglandular estrogen formation. In men who are between the ages of 25 and 70 years, the rate of testosterone production remains relatively constant (Table 54-1). Figure 54-5 summarizes the changes in plasma testosterone levels as a function of age in human males. 054-6

## Adipose tissue, skin, and the adrenal cortex also produce testosterone and other androgens

Several tissues besides the testes-including adipose tissue, skin, adrenal cortex, brain, and muscle-produce testosterone and several other androgens. These substances may be synthesized de novo from cholesterol or produced by peripheral conversion of precursors. Moreover, the peripheral organs and tissues may convert sex steroids to less active forms (see Fig. 54-6). Notable sites of extragonadal conversion include adipose tissue and the skin. Androstenedione is converted to testosterone in peripheral tissues. In this case,

# N54-4 Cytochrome P-450 Enzymes 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The term cytochrome P-450 enzymes refers to a family of several hundred heme-containing enzymes that are located primarily in the SER. See Table 50-2 for some examples of these enzymes that play a role in steroidogenesis. We discuss the roles of these P-450 enzymes for the adrenal gland on page 1021, for the testis on page 1097, and for the ovary on page 1117. On page 64, we discuss the role of a P-450 enzyme (i.e., epoxygenase) in the metabolism of arachidonic acid (see also Fig. 3-11).

These enzymes are monooxygenases.* That is, they transfer one atom of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate RH to form ROH, whereas the other oxygen atom accepts two protons from the reduced form of the enzyme to form water:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { P-450 } \left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \text { —reduced form) }+\mathrm{RH}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \text { P-450 (oxidized form) }\right. \\
& \left.+\mathrm{ROH}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$

This monooxygenation reaction is also referred to as a hydroxylation reaction because the enzyme hydroxylates RH to
form ROH. Note that at the end of the reaction, the P-450 monooxygenase is in its reduced form. Another enzyme-a cytochrome P-450 reductase-recycles the P-450 monooxygenase to its reduced form; in the process, this P-450 reductase becomes oxidized. Finally, the oxidized P-450 reductase recycles to its reduced form by oxidizing the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to NADP ${ }^{+}$or the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$or one of the flavin nucleotides (reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide $\left[\mathrm{FADH}_{3}\right]$ or reduced flavin mononucleotide $\left[\mathrm{FMNH}_{3}\right]$ ).

The P-450 enzymes are so named because when the reduced forms of the enzymes bind carbon monoxide, they absorb light strongly at 450 nm .

*Enzymes that transfer both oxygen atoms of molecular oxygen to an organic substrate are termed dioxygenases. In contrast, oxidases (e.g., cytochrome oxidase in the electron transport chain of mitochondria) are enzymes that catalyze oxidations in which neither of the atoms of molecular oxygen becomes part of the oxidized product. Instead, the molecular oxygen acts as an electron acceptor to form a molecule such as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$.

## N54-5 Delta-5 and Delta-4 Steroids

## Contributed by Sam Mesiano

Pregnenolone is called P5. Progesterone is P4. This is where the terms delta-5 and delta-4 come from.
$3 \beta$-HSD is a major branch-point enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway (see Fig. 54-6). It converts all delta-5 steroids to delta-4 steroids via an isomerase activity and therefore is essential for the production of mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. The competition between 17 $\alpha$-hydroxylase/17,20-desmolase (two enzymatic activities mediated in the same protein, also
known as $\mathrm{P}-450_{\alpha / 2}$ ) and $3 \beta$-HSD for pregnenolone and $17 \alpha$ hydroxypregnenolone is a major determinant of whether a steroidogenic cell will produce mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, or sex steroids. In the Leydig cell, $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase/17,20desmolase prevails to produce DHEA, which $17 \beta$-HSD1 then converts to androstenediol. DHEA can also undergo conversion, via $3 \beta$-HSD, to androstenedione, which $17 \beta$-HSD1 then converts to testosterone.

## N54-6 Testosterone Secretion and Production Rates

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the text, we noted that plasma testosterone levels are relatively constant in males between the ages of 25 and 70 years. As for any substance in the blood, the stability of plasma levels of testosterone indicates that the rate of testosterone production is equal to the rate of testosterone removal. However, the stability of plasma testosterone levels says nothing about the individual rates of production and removal.

It is important to distinguish between the secretion rate of a hormone and the production rate. Secretion refers to the release of the hormone from a specific organ or gland, and may be determined by selectively catheterizing the artery and vein supplying that tissue and ascertaining the arterial-venous difference in the concentration of that substance. For example, the concentration of testosterone is 400 to $500 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ in effluent of the spermatic vein; this level is $\sim 75$ times higher than the concentration found in the arterial blood. Thus, if we knew the blood flow out of the spermatic vein, then we could compute the rate of secretion of testosterone by the testis.

Production rate refers to the total appearance of the hormone in the circulation as the result of the secretion by all tissues in the body. Thus, the secretion rate for the testes equals the
whole-body production rate only when other tissues make no contribution.

In the steady state, the amount of testosterone cleared from the circulation equals the amount produced. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { PR }=\text { MCR } \times \text { [S] } \\
& (\mu \mathrm{g} / \text { day }) \quad(\mathrm{L} / \text { day }) \quad(\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L})
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, PR is the whole-body production rate, MCR is the metabolic clearance rate, and [S] is the concentration of the substance in the plasma. MCR is defined in the same way as renal clearances (see Table 33-2). That is, MCR is the virtual number of liters per day that are fully cleared of testosterone. This clearance is due to the metabolism of testosterone, which is discussed on pages 1099-1100. Because the mean metabolic clearance rate for testosterone is $\sim 1000 \mathrm{~L} /$ day, and the testosterone concentration is about $6.5 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ (range, 3 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{L}$ ), the production rate must be about $6500 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day. Evidence for this high clearance rate is the fact that the plasma half-life of testosterone is only 10 to 20 minutes.

| STEROID | BLOOD PRODUCTION RATE—HORMONE <br> DELIVERED TO THE BLOOD ( $\mu \mathrm{g} /$ day) | PLASMA CONCESTITIATION ( $\mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{L}$ ) |

androstenedione is the precursor for the hormone testosterone. Testosterone can be converted to estradiol or DHT or go "backward" by reversible interconversion to androstenedione. Thus, a potent hormone such as testosterone may also serve as a precursor for a weaker hormone (androstenedione), a hormone with different activities (estradiol), or a more potent hormone having similar activities (DHT). This last example may be illustrated by the effects of DHT on hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and the sex accessory organs. In these tissues, the androgenic effects of circulating testosterone are amplified by its conversion by $5 \alpha$-reductase to DHT, which has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor (AR; see p. 1085). Some tissues, including the brain, aromatize testosterone to estradiol, and thus the action of this metabolite occurs via the estrogen receptor.

The adrenal cortex (see p. 1021) is another source of androgen production in both males and females. Normal human adrenal glands synthesize and secrete the weak androgens DHEA, conjugated DHEA sulfate, and androstenedione. Essentially, all the DHEA in male plasma is of adrenal origin. However, $<1 \%$ of the total testosterone in plasma is derived from DHEA. As summarized in Table 54-1, the plasma concentration of androstenedione in males is only $\sim 25 \%$ that of testosterone. About $20 \%$ of androstenedione is generated by peripheral metabolism of other steroids. Although the adrenal gland contributes significantly to the total androgen milieu in males, it does not appear to have significant effects on stimulation and growth of the male accessory organs (Box 54-1). This occurs primarily as a result of DHT production from circulating testosterone.

## Testosterone acts on target organs by binding to a nuclear receptor

Most testosterone in the circulation is bound to specific binding proteins. About $45 \%$ of plasma testosterone binds to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and $\sim 55 \%$ binds to serum albumin and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG; see p. 1021). A small fraction ( $\sim 2 \%$ ) of the total circulating testosterone circulates free, or unbound, in plasma. The free form of testosterone enters the cell by passive diffusion and subsequently exerts biological actions or undergoes metabolism by other organs such as the prostate, liver, and intestines (see the next section). The quantity of testosterone entering a cell is determined by the plasma concentration and by the intracellular milieu of enzymes and binding proteins.

Once it diffuses into the cell, testosterone either binds to a high-affinity AR in the nucleus or undergoes conversion to DHT, which also binds to the AR. This receptor functions as a homodimer (AR/AR) and is a member of the family of nuclear receptors (see Table 3-6) that includes receptors for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progesterone,

## BOX 54-1 Testosterone and Aging Men

$\Gamma$or a long time, the abrupt hormonal alterations that signal the dramatic changes of female menopause were believed to have no correlate in men. We now know that men do experience a gradual decline in their serum testosterone levels (see Fig. 54-5) $\Theta$ N54-6 and that this decline is closely correlated with many of the changes that accompany aging: decreases in bone formation, muscle mass, growth of facial hair, appetite, and libido. The blood hematocrit also decreases. Testosterone replacement can reverse many of these changes by restoring muscle and bone mass and correcting the anemia.

Although the levels of both total and free testosterone decline with age, levels of LH are frequently not elevated. This finding is believed to indicate that some degree of hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction accompanies aging.
estrogens, vitamin D, thyroid hormone, and retinoic acid. The gene coding for the AR is located on the X chromosome. The androgen-AR complex is a transcription factor that binds to hormone response elements on DNA located in the promoter regions of the target genes. Interaction between the androgen-AR complex and nuclear chromatin causes marked increases in transcription, which ultimately lead to the synthesis of specific proteins. As a result of these synthetic processes, specific cell functions ensue, including growth and development. Thus, presence of the AR in a cell or tissue determines whether that tissue responds to androgens.

Whether the active compound in any tissue is DHT or testosterone depends on the presence or absence in that tissue of the microsomal enzyme $5 \alpha$-reductase, which converts testosterone to DHT. The biological activity of DHT is 30 to 50 times higher than that of testosterone. Some tissues, including the brain, aromatize testosterone to estradiol, and thus the action of this metabolite occurs via the estrogen receptor.

Some of the effects of androgens may be nongenomic. For example, androgens may stimulate hepatic microsomal protein synthesis by a mechanism independent of binding to the AR. Other evidence indicates that the action of androgens on the prostate gland may occur via the adenylyl cyclase/PKA system (see pp. 56-57) and could result in gene activation under some circumstances.

## Metabolism of testosterone occurs primarily in the liver and prostate

Only small amounts of testosterone enter the urine without metabolism; this urinary testosterone represents $<2 \%$ of the daily testosterone production. The large remaining balance

of testosterone and other androgens is converted in the liver to 17 -ketosteroids and in the prostate to DHT. The degradation products of testosterone are primarily excreted in the urine and feces as water-soluble conjugates of either sulfuric acid or glucuronic acid.

## BIOLOGY OF SPERMATOGENESIS AND SEMEN

Spermatogenesis includes mitotic divisions of spermatogonia, meiotic divisions of spermatocytes to spermatids, and maturation to spermatozoa (1) NS4-7

The primordial germ cells (see pp. 1076-1077) migrate into the gonad during embryogenesis. In males, these cells become the immature stem-cell population of the germinal cell line, or spermatogonia, and reside on the inner basal lamina of the seminiferous tubules (see Fig. 54-1E). Beginning at puberty and continuing thereafter throughout life, these spermatogonia divide mitotically (Fig. 54-7). The spermatogonia have the normal diploid complement of 46 chromosomes (2N): 22 pairs of autosomal chromosomes plus one X and one Y chromosome.

Spermatogonia can be classified into two types: A and B. Type A spermatogonia form the stem-cell population of male germ cells and divide by mitosis. One of the daughter cells renews the stock of type A spermatogonia and the other becomes a type B spermatogonium that undergoes several additional rounds of mitosis before its progeny initiate meiosis and progress through spermatogenesis (see Fig. 54-7). Type B spermatogonia that enter into the first meiotic division become primary spermatocytes. At prophase of meiosis I, the chromosomes undergo crossing over (see Fig. 53-2B). At this stage, each cell has a duplicated set of 46 chromosomes (4N): 22 pairs of duplicated autosomal chromosomes, a duplicated X chromosome, and a duplicated Y chromosome. After this first meiotic division is completed, the daughter cells become secondary spermatocytes, which have a haploid number of duplicated chromosomes (2N): 22 duplicated autosomal chromosomes and either a duplicated X or a duplicated Y chromosome. Secondary spermatocytes enter the second meiotic division almost immediately. This division results in smaller cells called spermatids, which have a haploid number of unduplicated chromosomes (1N). Spermatids form the inner layer of the epithelium and are found in rather discrete aggregates inasmuch as the cells derived from a single spermatogonium tend to remain togetherwith cytoplasm linked in a syncytium-and differentiate synchronously.

Spermatids transform into spermatozoa in a process called spermiogenesis, (1) NS4-7 which involves cytoplasmic reduction and differentiation of the body and the tailpieces. Thus, as maturation progresses, developing male gametes decrease in volume. Conversely, maturation leads to an increase in cell number, with each primary spermatocyte producing four spermatozoa, two with an X chromosome and two with a Y chromosome.

As additional generations of type B spermatogonia appear, the cells are displaced toward the lumen of the tubule. Thus, when viewed in cross sections of seminiferous tubules (see Fig. 54-1E), spermatogonia are located adjacent
to the basement membrane, whereas the more differentiated spermatids are located nearest the lumen. Groups of spermatogonia at comparable stages of development undergo mitosis simultaneously. However, spermatogenesis is asynchronous along the seminiferous tubule; different areas along the tubule are at different stages of spermatogenesis. In a continuous process, a young man produces sperm at a rate of $\sim 1000$ per second.

Each stage of spermatogenesis has a specific duration. The time between formation of type B spermatogonia and differentiation of daughter cells into mature sperm is $\sim 64$ days. Each cell type has a characteristic life span: 16 to 18 days for type B spermatogonia, 23 days for primary spermatocytes, 1 day for secondary spermatocytes, and $\sim 23$ days for spermatids. The rate of spermatogenesis is constant and cannot be accelerated by hormones such as gonadotropins or androgens. Germ cells must move forward in their differentiation. If the environment is unfavorable and makes it impossible for them to pursue their differentiation at the normal rate, they undergo apoptosis (see p. 1241) and are eliminated in the semen. Healthy 20-year-old men produce sperm at a rate of $\sim 6.5$ million sperm per gram of testicular parenchyma per day. The rate falls progressively with age and averages $\sim 3.8$ million sperm per gram per day in men 50 to 90 years old. This decrease is probably related to the high rate of apoptosis of germ cells during meiotic prophase. Among fertile men, those aged 51 to 90 years exhibit a significant decrease in the percentage of morphologically normal and motile spermatozoa.

In summary, three processes occur concurrently in the seminiferous epithelium: (1) the production of cells by mitosis, (2) differentiation of spermatogonia to spermatids with a reduction in the number of chromosomes by meiosis, and (3) the conversion of spermatids to mature sperm by spermiogenesis. Thus, spermatogenesis is a regular, ordered, sequential process resulting in the production of mature male gametes.

It is instructive to consider how spermatogenesis in the male differs from oogenesis in the female. The two processes differ in each of the three steps just noted: (1) In the female, the mitotic proliferation of germ cells takes place entirely before birth. In the male, spermatogonia proliferate only after puberty and then throughout life. (2) The meiotic divisions of a primary oocyte in the female produce only one mature ovum with a large amount of cytoplasm and two to three polar bodies (see p. 1073). In the male, the meiotic divisions of a primary spermatocyte produce four mature spermatozoa with a minimal amount of cytoplasm. (3) NS3-8 (3) In the female, the second meiotic division is completed only on fertilization (see p. 1131) and thus no further development of the cell takes place after the completion of meiosis. In the male, the products of meiosis (the spermatids) undergo substantial further differentiation to produce mature spermatozoa.

## The Sertoli cells support spermatogenesis

Sertoli cells (also called sustentacular cells) are generally regarded as support or "nurse" cells for the spermatids (Fig. 54-8). Sertoli cells (1) maintain an environment conducive for spermatogenesis; (2) in response to FSH, secrete

# N54-7 Definitions 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The following are definitions of four related terms:
Spermatogenesis. As noted on page 1100,
spermatogenesis includes the mitotic divisions of spermatogonia, the meiotic divisions of spermatogonia (diploid 2N DNA) to haploid spermatids (haploid 1N DNA), and the maturation to spermatozoa. This process includes both spermatocytogenesis and spermiogenesis.
Spermatocytogenesis. This term refers to the meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, in which spermatogonia (diploid 2N DNA) develop into primary spermatocytes (diploid 4N DNA), and then into secondary spermatocytes (haploid 2N DNA), and then finally into spermatids (haploid 1N DNA).
Spermiogenesis. This term refers to the maturation of spermatids (haploid 1N DNA) to mature spermatozoa. Spermiogenesis involves no cell division.
Spermiation. The release of the spermatozoa from the Sertoli cells is termed spermiation.

substances that promote proliferation of spermatogonia and initiate meiosis; (3) secrete androgen-binding protein, which concentrates testosterone in the proximity of developing gametes; (4) secrete inhibin, which controls pituitary gland production of FSH; (5) phagocytose excess cytoplasm produced by gametes during spermiogenesis; and (6) produce antimüllerian hormone, which represses formation of derivatives of the müllerian duct (see p. 1080).

The Sertoli cells are large polyhedral cells extending from the basement membrane toward the lumen of the
seminiferous tubule. Spermatids are located adjacent to the lumen of the seminiferous tubules during the early stages of spermiogenesis and are surrounded by processes of Sertoli cell cytoplasm. Tight junctions connect the adjacent Sertoli cells, forming a blood-testis barrier-analogous to the blood-brain barrier in both sexes (see pp. 284-287) and to the blood-oocyte/granulosa barrier in the ovarian follicle of females-that presumably provides a protective environment for developing germ cells. In addition, gap junctions between the Sertoli cells and developing spermatozoa may

# N54-12 Spermatogenesis 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Early during embryogenesis, the primordial germ cells migrate to the gonad, where they become type A spermatogonia. Beginning at puberty, the spermatogonia undergo many rounds of mitotic division, with one daughter cell renewing the type A stem-cell population and the other generating type B spermatogonia. After many mitotic divisions, type B spermatogonia (2N DNA) enter the first meiotic division, at which time they are referred to as primary spermatocytes. During prophase, each primary spermatocyte has a full complement of duplicated chromosomes (4N DNA). Each primary spermatocyte divides into two secondary spermatocytes, each with a haploid number of duplicated chromosomes (2N DNA). The secondary spermatocyte enters the second meiotic division, producing two spermatids, each of which has a haploid number of unduplicated chromosomes (1N DNA). Further maturation of the spermatids yields the spermatozoa (mature sperm). Note that one primary spermatocyte yields four spermatozoa.

represent a mechanism for transferring material between these two types of cells. Release of the spermatozoa from the Sertoli cell is called spermiation. Spermatids progressively move toward the lumen of the tubule and eventually lose all contact with the Sertoli cell after spermiation (Box 54-2).

## Sperm maturation occurs in the epididymis

The seminiferous tubules open into a network of tubules, the rete testis, that serves as a reservoir for sperm. The rete testis is connected to the epididymis via the efferent ductules (see p. 1078), which are located near the superior pole of the testicle. The epididymis is a highly convoluted single long duct, 4 to 5 m in total length, on the posterior aspect of the testis. The epididymis can be divided anatomically into three

## BOX 54-2 Sertoli Cell-Only Syndrome

CInicians have described a group of normally virilized men whose testes are small bilaterally and whose ejaculates contain no sperm cells (azoospermia). In these men, the seminiferous tubules are lined by Sertoli cells but show a complete absence of germ cells. Sertoli cell-only syndrome (or germinal cell aplasia) accounts for $10 \%$ to $30 \%$ of male infertility secondary to azoospermia and can either be caused by a single-gene defect or be acquired (e.g., as a result of orchitis, alcoholism, or toxic agents). Leydig cell function is usually preserved. Plasma testosterone and LH levels are usually normal, whereas FSH levels are often, but not always, elevated. It is not entirely clear why FSH levels are elevated in these men. This elevation may result from the absence of germ cells or from suboptimal secretion of inhibin by the Sertoli cells, inasmuch as inhibin is a powerful inhibitor of FSH secretion at the level of the anterior pituitary gland. Segments of Sertoli cell-only tubules may be observed in conditions such as orchitis or after exposure to agents that are toxic to the gonads. However, these individuals generally have functional spermatogenesis in the other seminiferous tubules.

regions: the head (the segment closest to the testis), the body, and the tail (see Fig. 54-1C).

Spermatozoa are essentially immotile on completion of spermiogenesis. Thus, transfer of spermatozoa from the seminiferous tubule to the rete testes is passive. Secretions flow from the testes through the epididymis with assistance by ciliary action of the luminal epithelium and contraction of the smooth-muscle elements of the efferent duct wall. Thus, sperm transport through this ductal system is also primarily passive. After leaving the testes, sperm take 12 to 26 days to travel through the epididymis and appear in the ejaculate. The epididymal transit time for men between the ages of 20 and 80 years does not differ significantly.

Sperm are stored in the epididymis, where they undergo a process of maturation before they are capable of progressive motility and fertilization (Table 54-2). Spermatozoa released at ejaculation are fully motile and capable of fertilization, whereas spermatozoa obtained directly from the testis are functionally immature insofar as they cannot penetrate an ovum. However, these immature spermatozoa

can fertilize if they are injected into an ovum. During maturation in the epididymis, spermatozoa undergo changes in motility, metabolism, and morphology. (54-8 Spermatozoa derived from the head (caput) of the epididymis (see Fig. 54-1C) are often unable to fertilize ova, whereas larger proportions of spermatozoa captured from the body (corpus) are fertile. Spermatozoa obtained from the tail (cauda) of the epididymis or from the vas deferens are almost always capable of fertilization.

The epididymis empties into the vas deferens, which is responsible for the movement of sperm along the tract. The vas deferens contains well-developed muscle layers that facilitate sperm movement. The vas deferens passes through the inguinal canal, traverses the ureter, and continues medially to the posterior and inferior aspect of the urinary bladder, where it is joined by the duct arising from the seminal vesicle; together, they form the ejaculatory duct. The ejaculatory duct enters the prostatic portion of the urethra after passing through the prostate. Sperm are stored in the epididymis as well as in the proximal end of the vas deferens. All these accessory structures depend on androgens secreted by the testis for full functional development.

## Spermatozoa are the only independently motile cells in the human body

Spermatozoa are highly specialized cells consisting of a head, midpiece, and tail (Fig. 54-9). The head contains the nucleus and is essentially devoid of cytoplasm, which is lost during spermatogenesis. Within the nucleus, the haploid number of chromosomes are packaged as tightly coiled chromatin fibers. The anterior segment of the head contains the acrosome, which lies in front of and around the anterior two thirds of the sperm nucleus, much like a motorcycle helmet fits over one's head. The acrosome is essentially a large secretory vesicle, originating from the Golgi complex in the spermatid and containing enzymes that will facilitate penetration of the ovum. The midpiece is the engine of sperm. It consists of multiple mitochondria arranged as spirals around a filamentous core. The energy for sperm motility comes from the metabolism of fructose present in the seminal fluid. The filamentous core in the midpiece forms a drive-shaft connection to the tail. The tail is a specialized flagellum, powered by the midpiece, that executes rapid lashing movements, propelling the cell forward.

## The accessory male sex glands-the seminal vesicles, prostate, and bulbourethral glands-produce the seminal plasma

Only $10 \%$ of the volume of semen (i.e., seminal fluid) is sperm cells. The normal concentration of sperm cells is $>20$ million per milliliter and the typical ejaculate volume is $>2 \mathrm{~mL}$. The typical ejaculate content varies between 150 and 600 million spermatozoa.

Aside from the sperm cells, the remainder of the semen (i.e., $90 \%$ ) is seminal plasma, the extracellular fluid of semen (Table 54-3). Very little seminal plasma accompanies the spermatozoa as they move through the testes and epididymis. The seminal plasma originates primarily from the accessory glands (the seminal vesicles, prostate gland, and

bulbourethral glands). The seminal vesicles contribute $\sim 70 \%$ of the volume of semen. Aside from the sperm, the remaining $\sim 20 \%$ represents epididymal fluids, as well as secretions of the prostate gland and bulbourethral glands. However, the composition of the fluid exiting the urethral meatus during ejaculation is not uniform. The first fluid to exit is a mixture of prostatic secretions and spermatozoa with epididymal fluid. Subsequent emissions are composed mainly

# N54-8 Sperm Maturation 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Most of the changes that occur to the sperm within the epididymis have to do with the acquisition of motility. Sperm isolated from the caput of the epididymis exhibit inconsistent patterns of motility, ranging from immotility to highly random movements of the flagellum. As sperm pass through the epididymis, rapid forward progression occurs and random tail flexing is reduced; these changes are first seen in a few spermatozoa obtained from the corpus and comprise the predominant pattern in those obtained from the cauda of the vas deferens. Motility is a prerequisite for fertility; it may be surmised that the acquisition of progressive forward motility is largely a function of maturation of the spermatozoa.

Biochemical changes also occur as sperm pass through the epididymis. It has been suggested that membrane-bound enzymes play a role in modifying the surface of spermatozoa during epididymal transit. Total protein concentrations decrease
by more than half in spermatozoa but remain unchanged in epididymal fluid during epididymal transit. Further, it appears that the majority of the testicle-derived proteins are removed from the spermatozoal surface during epididymal maturation, to be replaced by new low-molecular-weight peptides. These new peptides appear almost simultaneously with the development of forward-progressive motility.

Nuclear changes also occur as spermatozoa traverse the epididymis. Nuclear proteins play a role in morphogenesis and in the stabilization of the head of the sperm cell. Protamine staining increases as spermatozoa pass from the rete testes to the corpus of the epididymis and sharply declines thereafter. These observations, taken together, underscore the significance of the epididymis for sperm maturation, a prerequisite for the acquisition of fertilizing capacity.

of secretions derived from the seminal vesicles. The first portion of the ejaculate contains the highest density of sperm; it also usually contains a higher percentage of motile sperm cells.

Seminal plasma is isotonic. The pH in the lumen of the epididymis is relatively acidic ( 6.5 to 6.8 ) as the result of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ secretion by clear cells that are analogous to intercalated cells in the nephron (see p. 729). Addition of the relatively alkaline secretions of the seminal vesicles raises the final pH of seminal plasma to between 7.3 and 7.7. Spermatozoa generally tolerate alkalinity better than acidity. A pH near neutrality or slightly higher is optimal for the motility and survival of sperm cells in humans and in other species.

Seminal plasma contains a plethora of sugars and ions. Fructose and citric acid are contributed to the seminal plasma by the accessory glands, and their concentrations vary with the volume of semen ejaculated. The fructose is produced in the seminal vesicles. In a man with oligospermia (i.e., a low daily sperm output) and a low ejaculate volume (recall that more than half of the ejaculate comes from the seminal vesicles), the absence of fructose suggests obstruction or atresia of the seminal vesicles. Ascorbic acid and traces of B vitamins are also found in human seminal plasma. The prostate gland releases a factor-which contains sugars, sulfate, and a vitamin E derivative-that acts to prevent the clumping of sperm heads. In addition, human semen also contains high concentrations of choline and spermine, and is also rich in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$, and phosphate. Concentrations of $\mathrm{Zn}^{2+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ are higher in semen than in any other fluid and most other tissues. Calcium ions stimulate the motility of immature epididymal spermatozoa, but they inhibit the motility of spermatozoa in ejaculates obtained from humans. It appears that the diminished response of sperm to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and the acquisition of progressive motility are functions of epididymal maturation.

Semen also contains free amino acids, low-molecularweight polypeptides, and proteins. The free amino acids, which probably arise from the breakdown of protein after the semen is ejaculated, may protect spermatozoa by binding toxic heavy metals or by preventing the agglutination of proteins.

Human semen coagulates immediately after ejaculation. Coagulation is followed by liquefaction, which is apparently caused by proteolytic enzymes contained in prostatic secretions. Prostatic secretion is rich in acid phosphatase. The natural substrate for acid phosphatase is phosphorylcholine, which is contributed by the seminal vesicles. Hyaluronidase is also present in human semen, although its functional role remains to be clarified. Hyaluronidase is not a product of the accessory glands; rather, it is contained within the sperm cell cytoplasm and is rapidly released into the seminal plasma. Hyaluronidase may play a role in facilitating penetration of the oocyte by the sperm cell because of its ability to depolymerize hyaluronic acid. (5) NS4-9

## MALE SEX ACT

Sex steroids influence the central nervous system, even in utero, and play important roles in determining and regulating complex patterns of sexual behavior. However,
reproductive behavior is extraordinarily complex and is influenced by numerous factors other than sex steroids, such as one's genetic constitution, social contacts, and the age at which hormones exert their effects. In this subchapter we describe the neurophysiology of the male sex act.

## The sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system control the male genital system

The testes, epididymis, male accessory glands, and erectile tissue of the penis (corpora cavernosa and corpus spongiosum) receive dual innervation from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the autonomic nervous system (ANS; see pp. 340-341). The penis also receives both somatic efferent (i.e., motor) and afferent (i.e., sensory) innervation via the pudendal nerve (S2 through S4).

Sympathetic Division of the ANS As described in Chapter 14, the preganglionic sympathetic neurons originate in the thoracolumbar segments of the spinal cord (T1 through T12, L1 through L3; see Fig. 14-4). For the lower portion of the sympathetic chain (T5 and below), the preganglionic fibers may pass through the paravertebral sympathetic trunk and then pass via splanchnic nerves to a series of prevertebral plexuses and ganglia (see below). Once within one of these plexuses or ganglia, the preganglionic fiber may either (1) synapse with the postganglionic fiber, or (2) pass on to a more caudal plexus or ganglion without synapsing.

The sympathetic efferent (motor) nerve fibers that are supplied to the male sex organs emanate from five primary prevertebral nerve plexuses (Fig. 54-10): the celiac, superior mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, superior hypogastric, and inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexuses. The celiac plexus is of interest in a discussion of male sex organs only because preganglionic sympathetic fibers pass through this plexus on their way to more caudal plexuses. The superior mesenteric plexus lies on the ventral aspect of the aorta. Preganglionic fibers from the celiac plexus pass through the superior mesenteric plexus on their way to more caudal plexuses.

Most of the preganglionic sympathetic fibers pass from the superior mesenteric plexus to the inferior mesenteric plexus, although some of the nerves pass directly to the hypogastric plexus. The superior hypogastric plexus is a network of nerves located distal to the bifurcation of the aorta. The inferior hypogastric or pelvic plexus receives sympathetic supply from the hypogastric nerve.

In addition to these five plexuses, two other small ganglia are of interest. The spermatic ganglion is located near the origin of the testicular artery from the aorta. The spermatic ganglion receives fibers directly from the lumbar sympathetic nerves and from branches of several other ganglia. The hypogastric (or pelvic) ganglion is located at the junction of the hypogastric and pelvic nerve trunks.

Parasympathetic Division of the ANS The preganglionic parasympathetic neurons relating to the male reproductive system originate in the sacral segments of the spinal cord (S2 through S4; see Fig. 14-4). These fibers pass via the pelvic nerve to the pelvic plexus, where they synapse with the postganglionic parasympathetic neurons.

# N54-9 Congenital and Acquired Ductal Obstruction 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Genital duct obstruction may be congenital and may result from ductal absence or structural abnormality, or it may be acquired as a result of stricture, infection, or vasectomy. Genital duct obstruction is found in $\sim 7 \%$ of infertile men. An uncommon cause of male infertility is congenital absence of the vas deferens, which accounts for as many as $50 \%$ of cases of congenital ductal obstruction. These patients generally have azoospermic ejaculates with low volume. Congenital absence of the vas deferens is common in male patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and is sometimes the only manifestation of CF.

Epididymal abnormalities range from the presence of an incomplete epididymis to the presence of only small portions of the epididymis; in addition, the seminal vesicles are often absent. Spermatogenesis is thought to be normal inasmuch as testicular biopsy specimens demonstrate germ cells in several stages of development. Obstruction of the epididymis may also occur as a result of gonococcal or tuberculous epididymitis. Smallpox and
filariasis are common causes of ductal obstruction in areas where these diseases are endemic. Inspissated secretions may occlude the epididymis in men with Young syndrome or CF.

Elective vasectomy, a simple surgical procedure in which a small segment of the vas deferens is removed to ensure male infertility, is currently the leading cause of ductal obstruction.

Azoospermia in men with normal testes is the hallmark of genital duct obstruction. However, when specimens of testicles from men who have had vasectomies are examined microscopically, interstitial fibrosis is found in as many as $20 \%$ of cases. This group exhibits low fertility after elective reversal of their vasectomy. When the seminiferous tubules are examined, increased thickness of the tubule wall, an increase in crosssectional tubular area, and decreased numbers of Sertoli cells are usually noted. Testosterone and gonadotropin levels are normal in most patients with ductal obstruction.

## B SAGITTAL SECTION SHOWING INNERVATION OF MALE GENITAL SYSTEM

![bo300346323f](bo300346323f.jpg)

Figure 54-10 Innervation of the male genital system. A, The sympathetic innervation of the male genital system involves a series of prevertebral nerve plexuses and ganglia. B, Three motor pathways as well as a sensory pathway are involved in erection. (1) Parasympathetic innervation: Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers arise from the sacral spinal cord and from the pelvic nerve, and they synapse in the pelvic plexus. The postganglionic parasympathetic fibers follow the cavernous nerve to the penile corpora and vasculature. (2) Sympathetic innervation: Preganglionic sympathetic fibers exit the thoracolumbar cord and synapse in one of several prevertebral ganglia. Postganglionic fibers reach the genitalia via the hypogastric nerve, the pelvic plexus, and the cavernous nerves. (3) Somatic innervation: Somatic (i.e., not autonomic) motor fibers originate in the sacral spinal cord, forming the motor branch of the pudendal nerve. The fibers innervate the striated penile muscles. In addition to these three motor pathways, there is also an afferent pathway from the penis. The dorsal nerve of the penis is the main terminus of the sensory pudendal nerve and is the sole identifiable root for tactile sensory information from the penis.

Visceral Afferents Sensory fibers are present in all the nerve tracts described (see Fig. 14-2). These fibers either (1) travel with the pelvic nerves to the dorsal root of the spinal cord, (2) travel with the sacral nerves to the sympathetic trunk and then rise in the sympathetic trunk to the spinal cord, or (3) travel with the hypogastric nerve and ascend to more rostral prevertebral plexuses and then to the spinal cord.

The principal functions of motor innervation to the male accessory glands include control of smooth-muscle contraction, vascular tone, and epithelial secretory activity.

## Erection is primarily under parasympathetic control

During erection, relaxation of the smooth muscles of the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum allows

increased inflow of blood to fill the corporal interstices and results in an increase in volume and rigidity. Vascular actions of the smooth muscles of the corpora and the perineal striated muscles are coordinated. For example, contraction of the striated muscles overlying the vascular reservoirs of the penile bulb increases the pressure of the blood in the corpora and promotes increased rigidity. (54-10 The three major efferent (i.e., motor) pathways for the regulation of penile erection are parasympathetic (pelvic nerve), sympathetic (hypogastric nerve), and somatic (pudendal nerve). The two corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum are usually coordinated in their erection (i.e., tumescence) and detumescence. However, they may act independently inasmuch as their vascular and neuroeffector systems are relatively independent.

Parasympathetic Innervation The first and most important pathway for erection is the parasympathetic division of the ANS. These fibers derive from the lumbar and sacral portions of the spinal cord and travel via the pelvic nerve, the pelvic plexus, and the cavernous nerve to the penile corpora and vasculature (see Fig. 54-10). This pathway is almost entirely parasympathetic but apparently also carries some sympathetic fibers (see below). The parasympathetic activity results in vasodilatation of the penile blood vessels, which increases blood flow to the cavernous tissue and engorges the organ with blood. In erectile tissue, parasympathetic postganglionic terminals release acetylcholine ( ACh ) and nitric oxide (NO), similar to the system discussed in Figure 14-11. First, ACh binds to $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ muscarinic receptors on endothelial cells. Via $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{q}}$, these receptors would then lead to stimulation of PLC, increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, activation of NO synthase, and local release of NO (see p. 66). Second, the nerve terminals may also directly release NO. Regardless of the source of NO, this gas diffuses to the vascular smooth-muscle cell, where it stimulates guanylyl cyclase to generate cGMP, which in turn causes vasodilation (see Table 20-8; Box 54-3).

Sympathetic Innervation The second pathway, which is thought to be entirely sympathetic, exits the thoracolumbar spinal cord. The preganglionic fibers then course via the least splanchnic nerve, the sympathetic chain, and the inferior mesenteric ganglion. The postganglionic fibers reach the genitalia via the hypogastric nerve, the pelvic plexus, and the cavernous nerves (see above). Tonic sympathetic activity contributes to penile flaccidity. During erection, a decrease in this sympathetic tone allows relaxation of the corpora and thus contributes to tumescence.

Somatic Innervation The third pathway is the motor branch of the pudendal nerve. It has primarily somatic (i.e., not autonomic) fibers, originates in the sacral spinal cord, and innervates the striated penile muscles. Contraction of the striated ischiocavernosus muscle during the final phase of erection increases pressure inside the corpora cavernosa to values that are even higher than systemic arterial pressure. Contraction of the striated bulbospongiosus muscle increases engorgement of the corpus spongiosum, and thus the glans penis, by pumping blood up from the penile bulb underlying this muscle. Humans are apparently less dependent on their striated penile muscle for achieving and maintaining

## BOX 54-3 Erectile Dysfunction

Cildenafil (Viagra), vardenafil (Levitra), and tadafal (Cialis) are reasonably well tolerated oral medications used to treat erectile dysfunction. Men with erectile dysfunction experience significant improvement in rigidity and duration of erections after treatment with these medications.

As indicated in the text, the smooth-muscle tone of the human corpus cavernosum is regulated by the synthesis and release of NO, which raises [cGMP], in vascular smoothmuscle cells, thereby relaxing the smooth muscle and leading to vasodilatation and erection. Breakdown of cGMP by cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 limits the degree of vasodilation and, in the case of the penis, limits erection. Sildenafil, vardenafil, and tadafalfi are highly selective high-affinity inhibitors of cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 and thereby raise [cGMP], in smooth muscle and improve erection in men with erectile dysfunction.

The new medications are attractive because they are effective and benefit most men with insufficient erection. These medications stimulate erection only during sexual arousal and thus have a rather natural effect. They can be taken as little as 1 hour before planned sexual activity.

One of the side effects of sildenafil is "blue vision," a consequence of the effect of inhibiting cGMP-specific phosphodiesterase in the retina. In individuals taking other vasodilators, sildenafil can lead to sudden death. In women, sildenafil may improve sexual function by increasing blood flow to the accessory secretory glands (see pp. 1108 and 1127).
erection. However, these muscles are active during ejaculation and contribute to the force of seminal expulsion.

Postganglionic neurons release other so-called nonadrenergic, noncholinergic neurotransmitters (see p. 543)including NO-that also contribute to the erectile process.

Afferent Innervation The penis also has an afferent pathway. The dorsal nerve of the penis is the main terminus of the sensory pudendal nerve and is the sole identifiable root for tactile sensory information from the penis.

## Emission is primarily under sympathetic control

The term seminal emission refers to movement of the ejaculate into the prostatic or proximal part of the urethra. Under some conditions, seminal fluid escapes episodically or continuously from the penile urethra; this action is also referred to as emission. Emission is the result of peristaltic contractions of the ampullary portion of the vas deferens, the seminal vesicles, and the prostatic smooth muscles. These actions are accompanied by constriction of the internal sphincter of the bladder, which is under sympathetic control (see p. 736); this constriction of the sphincter prevents retrograde ejaculation of sperm into the urinary bladder (see Box 54-3).

The rhythmic contractions involved in emission result from contraction of smooth muscle. In contrast to those of other visceral organ systems, the smooth-muscle cells of the male ducts and accessory glands fail to establish close contact with one another and show limited electrotonic coupling. In the male accessory glands, individual smooth-muscle cells

Striated muscle also contributes to erection. The contribution of skeletal muscle varies among species but plays a lesser role in humans, where erections are purely vascular.

are directly innervated and have only limited spontaneous activity (i.e., multiunit smooth muscle; see p. 243). This combination allows a fast, powerful, and coordinated response to neural stimulation.

Motor Activity of the Duct System A gradation between two forms of smooth-muscle activity occurs along the male duct system. The efferent ducts and proximal regions of the epididymis are sparsely innervated but display spontaneous contractions that can be increased via adrenergic agents acting on $\alpha$-adrenergic receptors. In contrast, the distal end of the epididymis and the vas deferens are normally quiescent until neural stimulation is received during the ejaculatory process. Contraction of the smooth muscle of the distal epididymis, vas deferens, and accessory sex glands occurs in response to stimulation of the sympathetic fibers in the hypogastric nerve and release of norepinephrine. Indeed, an intravenous injection of epinephrine or norepinephrine can induce seminal emission, whereas selective chemical sympathectomy or an adrenergic antagonist can inhibit seminal emission. The role of parasympathetic innervation of the musculature of these ducts and accessory glands in the male is not entirely clear. Parasympathetic fibers may be preferentially involved in basal muscular activity during erection (i.e., before ejaculation) and during urination.

Secretory Activity of the Accessory Glands The effect of autonomic innervation on the secretory activity of the epithelia of the male accessory glands has been studied extensively. Electrical stimulation of the pelvic nerves (parasympathetic) induces copious secretions. The secretory rate depends on the frequency of stimulation and can be blocked with atropine, a competitive inhibitor of muscarinic ACh receptors. Cholinergic drugs induce the formation of copious amounts of secretions when these drugs are administered systemically. Secretions from the bulbourethral glands also contribute to the ejaculate. The bulbourethral glands do not store secretions but produce them during coitus. The secretory activity of the bulbourethral glands also appears to be under cholinergic control inasmuch as administration of atropine causes marked inhibition of secretion from these glands.

Control of the motor activity of the ducts and the secretory activity of the accessory glands is complex and involves both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions of the ANS. The central nervous system initiates and coordinates all these activities (Box 54-4).

## Ejaculation is under the control of a spinal reflex

As discussed, seminal emission transports semen to the proximal (posterior) part of the urethra. Ejaculation is the forceful expulsion of this semen from the urethra. Ejaculation is normally a reflex reaction triggered by the entry of semen from the prostatic urethra into the bulbous urethra.

## BOX 54-4 Retrograde Ejaculation

A$s$ noted in the text, emission is normally accompanied by constriction of the internal urethral sphincter. Retrograde ejaculation occurs when this sphincter fails to constrict. As a result, the semen enters the urinary bladder rather than passing down the urethra. Retrograde ejaculation should be suspected in patients who report absent or smallvolume ejaculation after orgasm. The presence of $>15$ sperm per high-power field in urine specimens obtained after ejaculation confirms the occurrence of retrograde ejaculation.

Lack of emission or retrograde ejaculation may result from any process that interferes with innervation of the vas deferens and bladder neck. Several medical illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus (which can cause peripheral neuropathy) and multiple sclerosis, or the use of pharmaceutical agents that interfere with sympathetic tone can lead to retrograde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation may also occur as a result of nerve damage associated with certain surgical procedures, including bladder neck surgery, transurethral resection of the prostate, colorectal surgery, and retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Retrograde ejaculation from causes other than surgery involving the bladder neck may be treated with pharmacological therapy. Sympathomimetic drugs such as phentolamine (an $\alpha$-adrenergic agonist), ephedrine (which enhances norepinephrine release), and imipramine (which inhibits norepinephrine reuptake by presynaptic terminals) may promote normal (i.e., anterograde) ejaculation by increasing the tone of the vas deferens (propelling the seminal fluid) and the internal sphincter (preventing retrograde movement).

Thus, emission sets the stage for ejaculation. The ejaculatory process is a spinal cord reflex, although it is also under considerable cerebral control. The afferent (i.e., sensory) impulses reach the sacral spinal cord (S2 through S4) and trigger efferent activity in the somatic motor neurons that travel via the pudendal nerve. The resulting rhythmic contractions of the striated muscles of the perineal area-including the muscles of the pelvic floor, as well as the ischiocavernosus and bulbospongiosus muscles-forcefully propel the semen via the urethra through the external meatus. In addition, spasmodic contractions of the muscles of the hips and the anal sphincter generally accompany ejaculation.

Orgasm is a term best restricted to the culmination of sexual excitation, as generally applied to both men and women. Orgasm is the cognitive correlation of ejaculation in the human male. Although orgasm, the pleasurable sensation that accompanies ejaculation, is not well understood, clearly it is as much a central phenomenon as it is a peripheral one. (5) NS4-11

# N54-11 Neuronal Lesions Affecting Erection and Ejaculation 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Erectile dysfunction is often associated with disorders of the central and peripheral nervous systems. Spinal cord disease and peripheral neuropathies are of particular interest, and effects of spinal cord injuries have been studied in some detail. Erectile capacity is usually preserved in men with lesions of the premotor neurons (neurons that project from the brain to the spinal cord; eTable 54-1). In these men, reflexogenic erections occur in $90 \%$ to $100 \%$ of cases, whereas psychogenic erections do not occur because the pathways from the brain are blocked. Ejaculation is more significantly impaired with upper than with lower motor neuron lesions, presumably because of loss of the psychogenic component.

A clinically important feature of the spinal segmentation of nerve roots (i.e., thoracolumbar and lumbosacral) for generation of erection is that spinal or peripheral nerve damage may affect
only one of the effector systems. Because the lumbosacral system also carries most of the penile afferents, erection in response to penile stimulation (reflexogenic) is most affected by damage to the lower spinal cord or the nerves that project there. Evidence from men with spinal injuries in the T10 through T12 region has implicated the sympathetic thoracolumbar pathway in mediation of erections resulting from sexual stimuli received via the cranial nerves or generated within the brain as memories, fantasies, or dreams. In men with lower motor neuron lesions, reflexogenic erections are absent. However, psychogenic erections still occur in most men with incomplete lesions and in about one fourth of men with complete lesions. It remains uncertain whether this sympathetic pathway is normally the principal route for psychogenic erections or whether it just assumes the role when lumbosacral parasympathetic pathways are damaged.

# THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM 

Sam Mesiano and Ervin E. Jones

The female reproductive system functions to (1) produce haploid gametes-ova, (2) facilitate syngamy-or fertilization-between an ovum and a spermatozoon, (3) supply a site for implantation of the embryo (if syngamy occurs) and the establishment of pregnancy, (4) provide for the physical environment and nutritional needs of the developing fetus and its timely birth, and (5) nurture the neonate.

The system consists of the gonads (the ovaries), the fallopian tubes, the uterus and cervix, the vagina (Fig. 55-1A), the external genitalia, and the mammary glands, and is controlled by hormones produced in the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries. The principal female sex hormones are estrogens (mainly estradiol) and progesterone, which are produced by the ovaries in a cyclic manner and regulate the growth and function of the female sex accessory structures and the development of secondary sexual characteristics. Function of the female reproductive system is ultimately regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis under the control of higher brain centers. The system involves finely tuned neuroendocrine feedback interactions between hormones produced by the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary and hormones produced by the ovaries. The result is the cyclic production of gametes and the preparation of the sex accessory organs for the establishment of pregnancy.

## Female reproductive organs include the ovaries and accessory sex organs

The ovaries lie on the sides of the pelvic cavity (see Fig. 55-1A). Covered by a layer of mesothelial cells, each ovary consists of an inner medulla and an outer cortex. The cortex of the ovary in a mature female contains developing follicles and corpora lutea in various stages of development (see Fig. 55-1B). These elements are interspersed throughout the stroma, which includes connective tissue, interstitial cells, and blood vessels. The medulla comprises large blood vessels and other stromal elements.

The female sex accessory organs include the fallopian tubes, the uterus, the vagina, and the external genitalia. The fallopian tubes provide a pathway for the transport of ova from the ovary to the uterus. The distal end of the fallopian tube expands as the infundibulum, which ends in multiple fimbriae. The fimbriae and the rest of the fallopian tubes are lined with epithelial cells, most of which have cilia that
beat toward the uterus. The activity of these cilia and the contractions of the wall of the fallopian tube, particularly around the time of ovulation, facilitate transport of the ovum. Interspersed with ciliated cells are peg cells that secrete fluid and nutrients supporting the ovum and spermatozoa as well as the zygote that may result as fertilization occurs in the fallopian tubes.

The uterus is a complex, pear-shaped, muscular organ that is suspended by a series of supporting ligaments. It is composed of a fundus, a corpus, and a narrow caudal portion called the cervix. The external surface of the uterus is covered by serosa, whereas the interior, or endometrium, of the uterus consists of complex glandular tissue and stroma. The bulk of the uterine wall consists of specialized smooth muscle, myometrium, that lies between the endometrium and the uterine serosa. The uterus is continuous with the vagina via the cervical canal. The cervix is composed of dense fibrous connective tissue and smooth-muscle cells. Glands lining the cervical canal produce a sugar-rich secretion, the viscosity of which is conditioned by estrogen and progesterone.

The human vagina is $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm}$ in length and is a single, expandable tube. The vagina is lined by stratified epithelium and is surrounded by a thin muscular layer. During development, the lower end of the vagina is covered by the membranous hymen, which is partially perforated during fetal life. In some instances, the hymen remains continuous. The external genitalia include the clitoris, the labia majora, and the labia minora, as well as the accessory secretory glands (including the glands of Bartholin), which open into the vestibule. The clitoris is an erectile organ that is homologous to the penis (see p. 1091) and mirrors the cavernous ends of the glans penis.

The breasts can also be considered as part of the female reproductive system. Breast development (thelarche) begins at puberty in response to ovarian steroid hormones. The ductal epithelium of the breast is sensitive to ovarian steroids and especially during pregnancy becomes activated to produce milk (lactation) that will sustain the newborn infant.

## Reproductive function in the human female is cyclic

In some species (e.g., rabbits), female reproductive function, and specifically ovulation (the liberation of fertilizable oocytes), is triggered by mating. However, in most species,

the female reproductive system functions in a cyclic manner. In some of these species with cyclic function (e.g., sheep, cattle, horses), females are receptive to males only around the time of ovulation, which maximizes the chances of fertilization and pregnancy. This receptive behavior is known as estrus, and the animals are said to have seasonal estrus cycles, whereby the ovaries are active only at a certain time of the year. Such cyclic reproductive function in females enhances reproductive efficiency by coordinating gamete production with environmental (in seasonal species) and physiological changes that attract males and prepare the reproductive tract for sperm and ovum transport, fertilization, implantation, and pregnancy. In a small subset of species (e.g., humans, baboons, apes), ovulation occurs in monthly cycles-known as menstrual cycles-that are associated with regular episodes of uterine bleeding termed menstruation.

## HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-GONADAL AXIS AND CONTROL OF THE MENSTRUAL CYCLE

## The human menstrual cycle coordinates changes in both the ovary and endometrium

The human menstrual cycle involves rhythmic changes in two organs: the ovary and the uterus (Fig. 55-2). Although menstrual cycles are generally regular during the reproductive years, the length of the menstrual cycle may be highly variable because of disturbances in neuroendocrine function. Starting with the first day of the menses on day 0 , the average menstrual cycle lasts 28 days. However, considerable variation occurs during both the early reproductive years and the premenopausal period, primarily because of the increased frequency of anovulatory cycles (Box 55-1).

The ovarian cycle includes four key events: (1) folliculogenesis, (2) ovulation, (3) formation of the corpus luteum, and (4) death (atresia) of the corpus luteum. Temporally, the ovarian cycle includes two major phases: the follicular and luteal phases. The follicular phase begins soon after the corpus luteum degenerates, lasts 12 to 14 days, and ends at ovulation. The luteal phase begins at ovulation, lasts 12 to 14 days, and ends when the corpus luteum degenerates.

Steroid hormones produced by the ovaries during the follicular and luteal phases induce changes in the endometrial lining of the uterus that constitute the endometrial cycle. The endometrial cycle consists of three key events: (1) menstruation, (2) endometrial growth and proliferation,
and (3) differentiation of the endometrial epithelium into a glandular secretory phenotype. The endometrial cycle is divided into menses, the proliferative phase and the secretory phase (see Fig. 55-2).

Ovarian and endometrial events are integrated into a single sequence as follows.

Follicular/Proliferative Phase The follicular/proliferative phase begins with the initiation of menstruation and averages $\sim 14$ days. The follicular phase of the ovarian cycle varies more in duration than any other phase of the cycle. During this time, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) stimulate the growth of a cohort of follicles, all of which (even those destined for atresia) produce estradiol. Consequently, circulating estradiol levels gradually increase during the follicular phase. Because estradiol stimulates rapid growth of the endometrium, this period is the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle. Eventually, a single large, dominant preovulatory follicle develops in one

## BOX 55-1 Effect of Energy Stores on Female Fertility

Activity of the hypothalamic GnRH neurons in females is very sensitive to environmental and physiological conditions, as is particularly obvious in species with a seasonal estrus. The evolutionary rationale for this environmental sensitivity is that reproduction is most efficient when resources are available to sustain a pregnancy and nurture the newborn. In addition, pregnancy confers a survival risk to females.

Leptin is produced by adipocytes and its levels in the circulation reflect the amount of energy stores (see pp. 10011002). Because leptin promotes the production and release of GnRH by hypothalamic neurons, leptin signals the brain that fat stores are sufficient to support human female reproductive function. Indeed, increased leptin levels are associated with the onset of puberty in both sexes, and normal levels of leptin are needed to maintain menstrual cycles and normal female reproductive function. Low levels of leptin-due to starvation, anorexia, or strenuous exercise-are associated with amenorrhea (cessation of menstrual cycles). Thus, signals to the neuroendocrine reproductive axis are permissive for reproduction if fuel reserves are adequate, but inhibit the system if reserves are low. The practical consequence is to help ensure that reproduction occurs when the female has sufficient energy reserves to sustain a pregnancy and nurture an infant.

of the ovaries. This follicle becomes the principal source of estradiol as the follicular phase progresses.

Ovulation As we will see below, for most of the follicular phase, estradiol exerts negative feedback on gonadotropin secretion at the level of the hypothalamus and pituitary. However, toward the end of the follicular phase (day 12 to 13), when estradiol levels are maximal, the effect of estradiol on the hypothalamus and pituitary switches from negative to positive feedback. The result is a large transient surge in LH and a small increase in FSH secretion by the gonadotrophs. The LH surge causes the dominant follicle to rupture and releases its oocyte-ovulation.

Luteal/Secretory Phase After release of the ovum, the remnants of the dominant follicle transform into a corpus luteum, which is why the second half of the ovarian cycle is called the luteal phase. Luteal cells produce progesterone and small amounts of estradiol, which together stimulate the endometrium to develop secretory glands-hence the term secretory phase of the endometrial cycle. If embryo implantation does not occur by day 20 to 22 of the cycle (i.e., midway through the luteal phase), the corpus luteum begins to degenerate and its production of progesterone and estradiol rapidly declines. The mechanisms that control the life span of the corpus luteum during a nonfertile cycle are not fully understood. If pregnancy is established, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) produced by the placenta maintains the corpus luteum. As a result, the corpus luteum maintains support for the endometrium, and menstruation does not occur.

Menses In the absence of pregnancy, withdrawal of progesterone (and estrogen) due to the demise of the corpus luteum leads to degeneration and shedding of the superficial part of the endometrium known as the functional layer. Degeneration of the functional layer is due to necrosis caused by the constriction of blood vessels that supply the endometrium. The necrotic tissue then sloughs away from the uterus and, in conjunction with blood from the underlying vessels and other uterine fluids, is shed as menstrual discharge (i.e., the period). Menstruation usually last 4 to 6 days. The first day of the menses (i.e., the first day of the endometrial cycle) is also the first day of the ovarian cycle. Rebuilding of the functional layer resumes when estrogen levels rise as a result of follicle growth during the new follicular phase.

## The hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis drives the menstrual cycle

Neurons in the hypothalamus synthesize, store, and release gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Long portal vessels carry the GnRH to the anterior pituitary, where the hormone binds to receptors on the surface of gonadotrophs. The results are the synthesis and release of both FSH and LH from the gonadotrophs (Fig. 55-3). These trophic hormones, LH and FSH, stimulate the ovary to synthesize and secrete the sex steroids estrogens and progestins as well as to produce mature gametes. The ovaries also produce peptides called inhibins and activins. Together, these ovarian steroids and peptides exert both negative and positive feedback on both
the hypothalamus and the anterior pituitary. This complex interaction is unique among the endocrine systems of the body in that it generates a monthly pattern of hormone fluctuations. Because the cyclic secretion of estrogens and progestins primarily controls endometrial maturation, menstruation reflects these cyclic changes in hormone secretion.

## Neurons in the hypothalamus release GnRH in a pulsatile fashion

A finely tuned neuroendocrine feedback between hormones produced by the brain and ovaries controls the menstrual cycle. As noted on pages 1092-1094, the process begins in the arcuate nucleus and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus, where neurons synthesize GnRH and transport it to their nerve terminals in the median eminence for storage and subsequent release. Higher centers in the brain trigger the release of GnRH near portal vessels, which carry GnRH to the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Before puberty, the GnRH neurons are quiescent and thus the reproductive system is inactive. (1) N55-1 After puberty, activity of the neurons increases, triggering release of GnRH in rhythmic pulses, about once per hour. Because the half-life of GnRH in blood is only 2 to 4 minutes, these hourly bursts of GnRH cause clearly discernible oscillations in GnRH levels in portal blood, leading to hourly surges in release of the gonadotropins LH and FSH. Early in the follicular phase of the cycle, when the gonadotrophs are not very GnRH sensitive, each burst of GnRH elicits only a small rise in LH (Fig. 55-4A). Later in the follicular phase, when the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary become much more sensitive to the GnRH in the portal blood, each burst of GnRH triggers a much larger release of LH (see Fig. 55-4B). (1) N55-2

The frequency of GnRH release, (1) N55-3 and thus LH release, determines the specific response of the gonad. Pulses spaced 60 to 90 minutes apart upregulate the GnRH receptors on the gonadotrophs, thus stimulating release of gonadotropins and activating the ovaries. However, continuous administration of GnRH (or an analog) causes downregulation of the GnRH receptors, which suppresses gonadotropin release and gonadal function (Box 55-2).

In addition to the hourly rhythm of GnRH secretion, a monthly rhythm of GnRH secretion also occurs in females of reproductive age. A massive increase in GnRH secretion by neurons in the preoptic area at midcycle is, in part, responsible for the LH surge, which, as we will see below (see p. 1116), leads to ovulation.

## GnRH stimulates gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary to secrete FSH and LH

GnRH enters the anterior pituitary through the portal system and binds to GnRH receptors on the surface of the gonadotroph, thus initiating a series of cellular events that result in the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. As discussed for the male on pages 1094-1095, occupation of the G protein-coupled GnRH receptor (GnRHR) (1) N55-4 leads to the formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$ and diacylglycerol (DAG; see p. 58). The $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ causes an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, triggering exocytosis and gonadotropin release (Fig. 55-5). In addition, the DAG stimulates protein kinase

## N55-1 Fetal Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

GnRH is present in the hypothalamus at 14 to 16 weeks' gestation, and its target, the gonadotropin-containing cells (gonadotrophs), are present in the anterior pituitary gland as early as 10 weeks' gestation. The hypothalamic-pituitary system is functionally competent by -23 weeks' gestation, at which time fetal tissues release GnRH.

## N55-3 Frequency versus Amplitude of Hypothalamic Releasing Hormones

## Contributed by Eugene Barrett

For GnRH release, it appears that the important factor for signaling is the frequency of the GnRH pulses. On the other hand, in the case of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH; see pp. 1023-1025), it appears that amplitude is the primary factor in controlling adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release. Thus, depending on the target of the releasing hormone, either frequency or amplitude can be dominant.

## N55-4 Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Receptor

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

The GnRH receptor (GnRHR) is internalized and partially degraded in the lysosomes. However, a portion of the GnRHR is shuttled back to the cell surface. Return of the GnRHR to the cell membrane is referred to as receptor replenishment and is related to the upregulation of receptor activity discussed above in the text. The mechanism through which GnRH receptor replenishment occurs remains unclear.

## N55-2 Control of Pulsing of Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone Neurons

## Contributed by Sam Mesiano

Although the mechanisms controlling the hourly pulses of GnRH remain unclear, the pulse generator for GnRH is thought to be located in the arcuate nucleus of the medial basal hypothalamus, where one group of GnRH neurons resides. GnRH neurons isolated from the rodent hypothalamus secrete GnRH in vitro in a rhythmic manner, with a frequency of approximately one pulse per hour. Those studies show that GnRH neurons have intrinsic pulsatile GnRH secretory activity and that the GnRH pulse generator resides within the GnRH neurons. In vivo studies show that bursts of nerve impulses from neurons in the arcuate nucleus correspond in time with the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and with the episodic release of LH from the anterior pituitary. These data suggest that a built-in system within the hypothalamus, and specifically the arcuate nucleus, controls the pulsatile discharge of GnRH from nerve terminals. Although the pulse generator is thought to be intrinsic to cells in the arcuate nucleus, it is significantly influenced by neurons from higher brain centers, predominantly in the cortex, that impact on the GnRH-secreting cells. Inhibitory and excitatory signals affect the pulse frequency of GnRH neurons. In general, kisspeptin neurons and glutamate neurons increase GnRH secretion frequency, whereas GABA neurons inhibit GnRH secretion and repress kisspeptin neurons. This GABA pathway is the main mechanism that keeps GnRH secretion relatively low during the juvenile prepubertal period.

At puberty, GnRH secretion and pulse frequency increase, mainly due to increased activity of kisspeptin neurons and reduction in tonic GABA inhibition. Decreased GABA activity also is thought to enhance the stimulation of kisspeptin neurons by glutamatergic signaling through N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptors. Thus, the GnRH pulse-generating mechanism is intrinsic to the hypothalamic GnRH neurons, whose rhythmic activity is modulated by GABAergic, kisspeptinergic, and glutamatergic neurons from higher centers in the cortex. The modulation of GnRH pulse frequency via specific neurotransmitters in response to integration by higher brain centers is key to the control of puberty onset and cyclic reproductive function.

Small-bodied neurons in the arcuate nucleus and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus secrete GnRH, which reaches the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary via the long portal veins. GnRH causes the gonadotrophs to synthesize and release two gonadotropins-FSH and LH. LH binds to receptors on theca cells to increase the biosynthesis of progestins and androgens. The androgens enter granulosa cells, which convert the androgens to estrogens. The dashed arrow indicates that the granulosa cells also have LH receptors. FSH binds to receptors on granulosa cells to increase the production of steroidogenic enzymes as well as activins and inhibins. The activins and inhibins act only on the anterior pituitary.

Before ovulation, the LH and FSH act on cells of the developing follicles. The theca cells (see p. 1117) of the follicle have LH receptors, whereas the granulosa cells (see p. 1117) have both LH and FSH receptors. After ovulation, LH acts on the cells of the corpus luteum. Both the LH and the FSH receptors are coupled through $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{\mathrm{s}}$ to adenylyl cyclase (see p. 53), which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP stimulates protein kinase A, which increases the expression of genes whose products enhance cell division or the production of peptide and steroid hormones.

The $\alpha$ chains of all four of these hormones are identical; in humans, they have 92 amino acids and a molecular weight of $\sim 20 \mathrm{kDa}$. The $\beta$ chains are unique and confer the specificity of the hormones.

In the female, the rhythm of GnRH secretion influences the relative rates of expression of genes encoding the synthesis of the $\alpha, \beta_{\text {FSH }}$, and $\beta_{\text {LH }}$ subunits of FSH and LH. GnRH pulsatility also determines the dimerization of the $\alpha$ and $\beta_{\text {FSH }}$ subunits, or $\alpha$ and $\beta_{\text {LH }}$, as well as their glycosylation. Differential secretion of FSH and LH is also affected by several other hormonal mediators, including ovarian steroids, inhibins, and activins. The role of these agents is discussed in the section on feedback control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis. Thus, depending on the specific hormonal milieu produced by different physiological circumstances, the gonadotroph produces and secretes the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of FSH and LH at different rates. The secretion of LH and FSH is further modulated by neuropeptides, amino acids such as aspartate, neuropeptide Y, corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and endogenous opioids.

are produced by the ovary feed back negatively on both the hypothalamus and the gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary. The net effect is reduced release of both LH and FSH. Estradiol exerts negative feedback at both low and high concentrations, whereas progesterone is effective only at high concentrations.

Although estradiol inhibits the GnRH neurons in the arcuate nucleus and preoptic area of the hypothalamus, this inhibition is not direct. Rather, estradiol stimulates interneurons that inhibit the GnRH neurons. In the arcuate nucleus, these inhibitory neurons exert their inhibition via opiates. However, in the preoptic area, the inhibitory neurons exert their inhibitory effect via gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a classic inhibitory neurotransmitter (see p. 309).

Positive Feedback by Ovarian Steroids Although ovarian steroids feed back negatively on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis during most of the menstrual cycle, they have the opposite effect at the end of the follicular phase. Levels of estradiol rise gradually during the first half the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle and then increase steeply during the second half (Fig. 55-6). After the estradiol levels reach a certain threshold for a minimum of 2 days-and perhaps because of the accelerated rate of estradiol secretion-the hypothalamicpituitary axis reverses its sensitivity to estrogens. That is, estradiol now exerts positive feedback on the axis. One manifestation of this positive feedback is that estradiol increases the sensitivity of the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary gland to GnRH. As discussed in the next section, this switch to positive feedback promotes the LH surge. Indeed, pituitary cells that are cultured in the absence of estradiol have suboptimal responses to GnRH. Once high levels of estradiol have properly conditioned the gonadotrophs, rising levels of progesterone during the late follicular phase also produce a positive-feedback response and thus facilitate the LH surge.

## BOX 55-2 Therapeutic Uses of GnRH

$\mathbf{G}$ontinuous administration of GnRH leads to downregulation (suppression) of gonadotropin secretion, whereas pulsatile release of GnRH causes upregulation (stimulation) of FSH and LH secretion. Clinical problems requiring upregulation of gonadotropin secretion, which leads to stimulation of the gonads, are therefore best treated by a pulsatile mode of GnRH administration. In contrast, when the patient requires gonadal inhibition, a continuous mode of administration is necessary.

An example of a disease requiring pulsatile GnRH administration is Kallmann syndrome. Disordered migration of GnRH cells during embryologic development causes Kallmann syndrome, which in adults results in hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and anosmia (loss of sense of smell). Normally, primordial GnRH cells originate in the nasal placode during embryologic development. These primitive cells then migrate through the forebrain to the diencephalon, where they become specific neuronal groups within the medial basal hypothalamus and preoptic area. In certain individuals, both male and female, proper migration of GnRH cells fails to occur. Females with Kallmann syndrome generally have amenorrhea (no menstrual cycles). However, the pituitary and gonads of these individuals can function properly when appropriately stimulated. Thus, females treated with exogenous gonadotropins or GnRH analogs-pulsatile administration with a programmed infusion pump-can have normal folliculogenesis, ovulation, and pregnancy.

An example of a disease requiring continuous GnRH administration to downregulate gonadal function is endometriosis. Endometriosis is a common condition caused by the aberrant presence of endometrial tissue outside the uterine cavity. This tissue responds to estrogens during the menstrual cycle and is a source of pain and other problems, including infertility. In patients with endometriosis, continuous administration of GnRH analogs inhibits replenishment of the receptor for GnRH in the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary. As a result, insufficient numbers of GnRH receptors are available for optimum GnRH action; this deficiency diminishes gonadotropin secretion and produces relative hypoestrogenism. Because estrogen stimulates the endometrium, continuous administration of GnRH or GnRH analogs causes involution and diminution of endometriotic tissue.

Leiomyomas (smooth-muscle tumors) of the uterus (also called uterine fibroids) are also estrogen dependent. When estrogen levels are decreased, the proliferation of these lesions is decreased. Therefore, leiomyomas of the uterus can also be effectively treated by continuous administration of GnRH analogs.

## Ovaries produce peptide hormones-inhibins, activins, and follistatins-that modulate FSH secretion

Inhibins, activins, and follistatins are gonadal peptide hormones, originally identified in follicular fluid, that selectively affect the production and secretion of FSH but do not affect LH. Inhibins inhibit FSH production by gonadotrophs, activins activate FSH production, and follistatins inhibit FSH production by binding to and thereby inhibiting activins.

The inhibins and the activins are glycoproteins that are members of the transforming growth factor- $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ) superfamily, which also includes antimüllerian hormone

(AMH; see p. 1080). The inhibins and activins are dimers constructed from a related set of building blocks: a glycosylated $20-\mathrm{kDa} \alpha$ subunit and two nonglycosylated $12-\mathrm{kDa} \beta$ subunits, one called $\beta_{\mathrm{A}}$ and the other called $\beta_{\mathrm{B}}$ (Fig. 55-7). The inhibins are always composed of one $\alpha$ subunit and either a $\beta_{\mathrm{A}}$ or a $\beta_{\mathrm{B}}$ subunit; the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits are linked by disulfide bridges. The $\alpha-\beta_{\mathrm{A}}$ dimer is called inhibin A, whereas the $\alpha-\beta_{\mathrm{B}}$ dimer is called inhibin B. The activins, however, are composed of two $\beta$-type subunits. Thus, three kinds of activins are recognized: $\beta_{\mathrm{A}}-\beta_{\mathrm{A}}, \beta_{\mathrm{B}}-\beta_{\mathrm{B}}$, and the heterodimer $\beta_{\mathrm{A}}-\beta_{\mathrm{B}}$. Follistatin is an unrelated monomeric polypeptide that binds to activin with high affinity.

Negative Feedback by the Inhibins FSH specifically stimulates the granulosa cells to produce inhibins. Estradiol also stimulates inhibin production through an intraovarian mechanism. Just before ovulation, after the granulosa cells acquire LH receptors, LH also stimulates the production of inhibin by granulosa cells. Inhibins are also produced by other tissues-including the pituitary, the brain, the adrenal gland, the kidney, the bone marrow, the corpus luteum, and the placenta. Nevertheless, the biological action of the inhibins is primarily confined to the reproductive system.

The inhibins inhibit FSH secretion by the gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary (hence the name inhibin) in a classic negative-feedback arrangement. The initial action of inhibin appears to be beyond the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-mobilization step in FSH secretion. In cultured pituitary cells, even very small amounts of inhibin markedly reduce mRNA levels for both the $\alpha_{\mathrm{LH}}$ FSH and the $\beta_{\mathrm{FSH}}$ subunits. As a result, inhibins suppress FSH secretion. In contrast, inhibins have no effect on the mRNA levels of $\beta_{\mathrm{LH}}$. In addition to their actions on the anterior pituitary, the inhibins also have the intraovarian effect of decreasing androgen production, which can have secondary effects on intrafollicular estrogen production.

Positive Feedback by the Activins The same tissues that produce the inhibins also produce the activins, which promote marked increases in $\beta_{\text {FSH }}$ mRNA and FSH release with no change in $\beta_{\mathrm{LH}}$ formation. Activins augment GnRH production and release by hypothalamic neurons. However, the physiological role of activins in the female reproductive system is more complex than that of inhibins because multiple extragonadal tissues produce activin (and follistatin), which may affect the hypothalamic-pituitarygonadal axis at many levels. Within the ovary, activins modulate folliculogenesis and steroid hormone production

Figure 55-6 Hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. The menstrual cycle is a cycle of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, as well as a cycle of the target of the ovarian hormones: the endometrium of the uterus. Therefore, the menstrual cycle includes both the ovarian cycle-which includes the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase-and the endometrial cycle-which includes the menstrual, the proliferative, and the secretory phases.
by the corpus luteum. Each of these effects is inhibited by inhibin and follistatin.

Activins bind to two types of cell-surface receptors (types I and II) that are serine/threonine kinases (see pp. 67-68). Upon ligand activation, the receptors couple to the SMAD second-messenger kinase cascade, which results in the modulation of transcription factors that affect the expression of a large variety of genes. Two cell-surface molecules that bind inhibin with high affinity antagonize the action of activin.

## Modulation of gonadotropin secretion by positive and negative ovarian feedback produces the normal menstrual rhythm

In premenopausal women, the pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus, generally occurring every 60 to 90 minutes (see p. 1111), triggers a corresponding pulsatile release of LH and FSH from the gonadotrophs of the anterior pituitary. The gonadotropins induce the production and
release of ovarian steroids, which in turn feed back on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This feedback loop is unusual because it elicits negative feedback on the hypothalamicpituitary axis throughout most of the menstrual cycle but positive feedback immediately before ovulation.

Figure 55-6 illustrates the cyclic hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle. The time-averaged records of LH and FSH levels mask their hour-by-hour pulsatility. The follicular phase is characterized by a relatively high frequency of GnRH-and thus LH—pulses. Early in the follicular phase, when levels of estradiol are low but rising, the frequency of LH pulses remains unchanged, but their amplitude gradually increases with time. Figure 55-4 shows this increase in amplitude between the early and late follicular phases. Later in the follicular phase, the higher estradiol levels cause both the frequency and the amplitude of the LH pulses to increase gradually. During this time of high estradiol levels, the ovarian steroids are beginning to feed back positively on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Late in the follicular phase, the net effect of this increased frequency and amplitude of

Figure 55-7 Inhibins and activins. The inhibins and activins are peptide hormones that are made up of a common set of building blocks. For both the inhibins and the activins, disulfide bonds link the two subunits.

LH and FSH pulses is an increase in their time-averaged circulating levels (see Fig. 55-6).

The LH surge is an abrupt and dramatic rise in the LH level that occurs around the 13th to 14th day of the follicular phase in the average woman. The LH surge peaks $\sim 12$ hours after its initiation and lasts for $\sim 48$ hours. The peak concentration of LH during the surge is $\sim 3$-fold greater than the concentration before the surge (see Fig. 55-6). The LH surge is superimposed on the smaller FSH surge. Positive feedback of estrogens, progestins, and activins on the hypothalamicpituitary axis is involved in the induction of this LH surge. The primary trigger of the gonadotropin surge is a rise in estradiol to very high threshold levels just before the LH surge. The rise in estrogen levels has two effects. First, the accelerated rate of increase in estradiol levels in the preovulatory phase sensitizes the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary to GnRH pulses (see Fig. 55-4). Second, the increasing estrogen levels also modulate hypothalamic neuronal activity and induce a GnRH surge, presumably through GnRH neurons in the preoptic area of the hypothalamus. Thus, the powerful positive-feedback action of estradiol induces the midcycle surge of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH. Gradually rising levels of the activins-secreted by granulosa cellsalso act in a positive-feedback manner to contribute to the FSH surge. In addition, gradually increasing levels of LH trigger the preovulatory follicle to increase its secretion of
progesterone. These increasing-but still "low"-levels of progesterone also have a positive-feedback effect on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis that is synergistic with the positive-feedback effect of the estrogens. Thus, although progesterone is not the primary trigger for the LH surge, it augments the effects of estradiol.

The gonadotropin surge causes ovulation and luteinization. The ovarian follicle ruptures, probably because of weakening of the follicular wall, and expels the oocyte and with it the surrounding cumulus and corona cells. This process is known as ovulation, and it is discussed in more detail in Chapter 56. As discussed below, a physiological change-luteinization-in the granulosa cells of the follicle causes these cells to secrete progesterone rather than estradiol. The granulosa and theca cells undergo structural changes that transform them into luteal cells, a process known as luteinization. The pulsatile rhythm of GnRH release and gonadotropin secretion is maintained throughout the gonadotropin surge.

As the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle begins, circulating levels of LH and FSH rapidly decrease (see Fig. 55-6). This fall-off in gonadotropin levels reflects negative feedback by three ovarian hormones-estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin. Moreover, as gonadotropin levels fall, the levels of ovarian steroids also fall. Thus, immediately after ovulation we see more or less concurrent decreases in the levels of both gonadotropins and ovarian hormones.

Later, during the luteal phase, the luteal cells of the corpus luteum gradually increase their synthesis of estradiol, progesterone, and inhibin (see Fig. 55-6). The rise in the concentration of these hormones causes-in typical negativefeedback fashion-the continued decrease of gonadotropin levels midway through the luteal phase. One of the mechanisms of this negative feedback is the effect of progesterone on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. Recall that at the peak of the LH surge, both the frequency and the amplitude of LH pulses are high. Progesterone levels rise, and high levels stimulate inhibitory opioidergic interneurons in the hypothalamus, which inhibits the GnRH neurons. This inhibition decreases the frequency of LH pulses, although the amplitude remains rather high.

By $\sim 48$ hours before onset of the menses, the pulsatile rhythm of LH secretion has decreased to one pulse every 3 to 4 hours. As a result, circulating levels of LH slowly fall during the luteal phase. During the late luteal phase, the gradual demise of the corpus luteum leads to decreases in the levels of progesterone, estradiol, and inhibin (see Fig. 55-6). After the onset of menstruation, the hypothalamicpituitary axis returns to a follicular-phase pattern of LH secretion (i.e., a gradual increase in the frequency of GnRH pulses).

## OVARIAN STEROIDS

## Starting from cholesterol, the ovary synthesizes estradiol, the major estrogen, and progesterone, the major progestin

Estrogens in female humans are derived from the ovary and the adrenal gland and from peripheral conversion of androgens in adipose tissue. In a nonpregnant woman,

estradiol, the primary circulating estrogen, is secreted principally by the ovary. The precursor for the biosynthesis of the ovarian steroids, as it is for all other steroid hormones produced elsewhere in the body, is cholesterol. Cholesterol is a 27 -carbon sterol that is both ingested in the diet and synthesized in the liver from acetate (see p. 968). Ovarian cells can synthesize their own cholesterol de novo. Alternatively, cholesterol can enter cells in the form of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and bind to LDL receptors.

As shown in Figure 55-8, a P-450 enzyme (○) NS4-4 (see Table 50-2) known as the side-chain-cleavage enzyme (or 20,22-desmolase) catalyzes the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. This reaction is the rate-limiting step in estrogen production. Ovarian cells then convert pregnenolone to progestins and estrogens. The initial steps of estrogen biosynthesis from pregnenolone follow the same steps as synthesis of the two so-called adrenal androgens dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione, both of which have 19 carbon atoms. We discuss these steps in connection with both substances (see Figs. 50-2 and 54-6). The Leydig cells in the testis can use either of two pathways to convert these weak androgens to testosterone. Cells in the ovaries are different because, as shown in Figure 55-9, they have a $\mathbf{P}-450$ aromatase ( $\mathbf{P}-450_{\text {arom }}$ ) that can convert androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol. This aromatization also results in loss of the 19-methyl group (thus, the estrogens have only 18 carbons), as well as conversion of the ketone at position 3 to a hydroxyl in the A ring of the androgen precursor. Once formed, estrone can be converted into the more powerful estrogen estradiol, and vice versa, by $17 \beta$-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ( $17 \beta$-HSD). Finally, the liver can convert both estradiol and estrone into the weak estrogen estriol.

The two major progestins, progesterone and $17 \alpha$ hydroxyprogesterone, are formed even earlier in the biosynthetic pathway than the adrenal androgens. Functionally, progesterone is the more important progestin, and it has higher circulating levels (Box 55-3).

## Estrogen biosynthesis requires two ovarian cells and two gonadotropins, whereas progestin synthesis requires only a single cell

A unique aspect of estradiol synthesis in the ovary is that it requires the contribution of two distinct cell types: the theca and granulosa cells within the follicle and the thecalutein and granulosa-lutein cells within the corpus luteum (see Fig. 55-9).

The superficial theca cells and theca-lutein cells can take up cholesterol and produce DHEA and androstenedione (see Fig. 55-8), but they do not have the aromatase necessary for estrogen production. The deeper granulosa cells and granulosa-lutein cells have the aromatase, but they lack the $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase and 17,20-desmolase (which are the same protein) necessary for making DHEA and androstenedione. Another difference between the two cell types is that, in the follicle, the superficial theca cell is near blood vessels, which supply LDL cholesterol. The granulosa cell, conversely, is far from blood vessels and, instead, is surrounded by LDLdeficient follicular fluid. Thus, in the follicular stage, the
granulosa cells obtain most of their cholesterol by de novo synthesis. However, after formation of the corpus luteum, the accompanying vascularization makes it possible for the granulosa-lutein cell to take up LDL cholesterol from the blood and to thus synthesize large amounts of progesterone. A final difference between the two cell types is that theca cells have LH receptors, whereas granulosa cells have both LH and FSH receptors.

Because of their unique physiological properties, neither the theca/theca-lutein cells nor the granulosa/granulosalutein cells can make estrogens by themselves. According to the two-cell, two-gonadotropin hypothesis, estrogen synthesis occurs in the following steps:

Step 1: LH stimulates the theca cell, through the adenylyl cyclase pathway, to increase its synthesis of LDL receptors and the side-chain-cleavage enzyme.
Step 2: Thus stimulated, the theca cell increases its synthesis of androstenedione.
Step 3: The androstenedione synthesized in the theca cells freely diffuses to the granulosa cells.
Step 4: FSH, also acting through the adenylyl cyclase pathway, stimulates the granulosa cell to produce aromatase.
Step 5: The aromatase converts androstenedione to estrone (see Fig. 55-8). $17 \beta$-HSD then converts the estrone to estradiol. Alternatively, $17 \beta$-HSD can first convert the same androstenedione to testosterone, and then the aromatase can convert this product to estradiol. By these pathways, theca-derived androgens are converted to estrogens in the granulosa cell.
Step 6: The estradiol diffuses into the blood vessels.
At low concentrations, the weak androgens produced by the theca cells are substrates for estrogen synthesis by the granulosa cells, in addition to enhancing the aromatase activity of granulosa cells. However, at high concentrations, conversion of androgens to estrogens is diminished. Instead, the weak androgens are preferentially converted by $5 \alpha$ reductase (see Fig. 54-6) to more potent androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone, a substance that cannot be converted to estrogen. Furthermore, these $5 \alpha$-reduced androgens inhibit aromatase activity. Thus, the net effect of a highandrogen environment in the follicle is to decrease estrogen production. These androgens also inhibit LH receptor formation on follicular cells.

In the luteal phase of the cycle, luteinization of the follicle substantially changes the biochemistry of the theca and granulosa cells. As part of the formation of the corpus luteum, blood vessels invade deep toward the granulosalutein cells. Recall that in the follicle, the granulosa cells had been surrounded by follicular fluid, which is poor in LDL cholesterol. The increased vascularity facilitates the delivery of LDL cholesterol to the granulosa-lutein cells. In addition, LH stimulates the granulosa-lutein cells to take up and process cholesterol-as it does the theca cells. The net effect is the increased progesterone biosynthesis that is characteristic of the midluteal phase. Indeed, the major products of the corpus luteum are progesterone and $17 \alpha$ hydroxyprogesterone, although the corpus luteum also produces estradiol. As indicated in Figure 55-9, the granulosalutein cells cannot make either $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone

![bo390346323f](bo390346323f.jpg)
or estradiol directly because these cells lack the protein that has dual activity for $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase and 17,20desmolase (see Fig. 55-8). Thus, $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone synthesis necessitates that progesterone first moves to the theca-lutein cell (see Fig. 55-9), which can convert
progesterone to $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone, as well as androstenedione. Furthermore, estradiol synthesis necessitates that androstenedione from the theca-lutein cell move to the granulosa-lutein cell for aromatization and formation of estradiol.

# BOX 55-3 The Birth Control Pill 

Hormonal contraception is the most commonly used method of contraception in the United States; 30\% of sexually active women take the oral contraceptive pill (OCP).

## Types of Oral Contraceptives

Numerous combination (i.e., estrogen and progestin) oral contraceptives and progestin-only pills are available. The estrogens and progestins used in OCPs have varying potencies. In the United States, two estrogen compounds are approved for oral contraceptive use: ethinyl estradiol and mestranol. The progestins used in OCPs are modified steroids in which the methyl at position 19 (see Fig. 55-8) is removed; these progestins include norethindrone, norgestrel, norethynodrel, norethindrone acetate, and ethynodiol diacetate. A new generation of progestinsincluding gestodene and norgestimate-have reduced androgenic effects.

The woman takes the OCPs daily for 21 days out of the 28-day cycle; she takes no pill, a placebo, or an iron pill during days 22 to 28 . No medication is usually given during this fourth week to allow withdrawal bleeding to occur. Three regimens of contraceptive steroid administration are used:

1. Monophasic or fixed-combination OCPs. The pills taken for the first 21 days of the cycle are identical.
2. Multiphasic or varying-dose OCPs. The pills contain two or three different amounts of the same estrogen and progestin, the dosages of which vary at specific intervals during the 21-day medication period. Multiphasic OCPs generally maintain a low dose of estrogen throughout the cycle, combined with varying amounts of progestin. The rationale for this type of formulation is that the woman takes a lower total dose of steroid but is not at increased risk of breakthrough endometrial bleeding.
3. Progestin-only OCPs ("minipill"). These estrogen-free pills are taken daily for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. This regimen may be associated with irregular, low-grade breakthrough endometrial bleeding. The progestin-only OCP is a good option for nursing mothers as well as women for whom estrogens are contraindicated (e.g., those with thromboembolic disease, a history of cerebrovascular incidents, or hypertension).

## Biological Action of Oral Contraceptives

The contraceptive effectiveness of OCPs accrues from several actions. Like natural ovarian steroids, contraceptive steroids feed back both directly at the level of the hypothalamus (decreasing secretion of GnRH) and at the level of the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary (see Fig. 55-3). The net effect is suppressed secretion of the gonadotropins FSH and LH. The low FSH levels are insufficient to stimulate normal folliculogenesis; the low LH levels obviate the LH surge and therefore inhibit ovulation. However, in the commonly used doses, contraceptive steroids do not completely abolish either gonadotropin secretion or ovarian function.

The progestin component of the OCP causes the cervical mucus to thicken and become viscid and scant. These actions inhibit sperm penetration into the uterus. The progestins also impair the motility of the uterus and oviducts and therefore decrease transport of both ova and sperm to the normal site of fertilization in the distal fallopian tube (see p. 1129). Progestins also produce changes in the endometrium that are not conducive for implantation of the embryo. These changes include decreased glandular production of glycogen and thus diminished energy for the blastocyst to survive in the uterus.

Progestin-only OCPs do not effectively inhibit ovulation, as do the combination pills. However, they do produce other actions, as noted above: mucus thickening, reduced motility, and impaired implantation. Because they are inconsistent inhibitors of ovulation, the progestin-only OCPs have a substantially higher failure rate than does the combined type of OCPs.

Side effects of the compounds in OCPs are those associated with estrogens and progestins and include nausea, edema, headaches, and weight gain. Specific side effects of progestins include depression, mastodynia, acne, and hirsutism. Many of the side effects associated with the progestin component of the pill, particularly acne and hirsutism, are the result of the androgenic actions of the progestins used. The potential benefits of the newer progestins include decreased androgenic effects, such as increased sex hormone-binding globulin, improved glucose tolerance (see p. 1038), and increased high-density and decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (see Table 46-4). The clinical impact of these changes remains to be determined. Table 55-1 lists the major benefits and risks of OCPs.

## Estrogens stimulate cellular proliferation and growth of sex organs and other tissues related to reproduction

Most estrogens in blood plasma are bound to carrier proteins, as are testosterone and other steroid hormones. In the case of estradiol, $60 \%$ is bound to albumin and $38 \%$ to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG; see p. 1099)-also known as testosterone-binding globulin (TeBG). TeBG is doubly a misnomer because this protein binds estradiol and, moreover, its levels are twice as high in women as in men. At least one reason for the higher levels in women is that estrogens (including birth control pills) stimulate the synthesis of SHBG. Only $2 \%$ of total plasma estradiol circulates as the free hormone, which readily crosses cell membranes. The nuclear estrogen receptors ER $\alpha$ and ER $\beta$ function as dimers ( $\alpha \alpha, \alpha \beta$, or $\beta \beta$; see Table 3-6). When bound

![bo400346323f](bo400346323f.jpg)

Figure 55-9 Two-cell, two-gonadotropin model. During the follicular phase, the major product of the follicle is estradiol, whereas during the luteal phase, the major products of the corpus luteum are the progestins, although estradiol synthesis is still substantial. In the follicular phase, LH primes the theca cell to convert cholesterol to androstenedione. Because the theca cell lacks aromatase, it cannot generate estradiol from this androstenedione. Instead, the androstenedione diffuses to the granulosa cell, whose aromatase activity has been stimulated by FSH. The aromatase converts the androstenedione to estradiol. In the luteal phase, the vascularization of the corpus luteum makes LDL available to the granulosa-lutein cells. Thus, both the theca-lutein and the granulosa-lutein cells can produce progesterone, the major product of the corpus luteum. For production of $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone ( $17 \alpha-\mathrm{OH}$ progesterone), some of the progesterone diffuses into the theca-lutein cell, which has the $17 \alpha$-hydroxylase activity needed for converting the progesterone to $17 \alpha$-hydroxyprogesterone. The theca-lutein cell can also generate androstenedione, which diffuses into the granulosa-lutein cell for estradiol synthesis. AC, adenylyl cyclase.
to estrogen, the ER dimer interacts with steroid response elements on chromatin and induces the transcription of specific genes. Over the next several hours, DNA synthesis increases, and the mitogenic action of estrogens becomes apparent. Estrogens almost exclusively affect particular target sex organs-including uterus and breasts-that have ERs.

In addition to acting through nuclear receptors, estrogens can also exert nongenomic actions (see p. 989) by binding to the G protein-coupled receptor GPR30.

The progestins, particularly progesterone, stimulate glandular secretion in reproductive tissue and promote the maturation of certain estrogen-stimulated tissue. One of the most prominent actions of progesterone, which binds to the dimeric progesterone receptor (PR; see Table 3-6), is the induction of secretory changes in the endometrium. In part because estrogens induce PR expression in endometrial cells, estrogens must condition the endometrium for progesterone to act effectively, as during the luteal phase. During the latter half of the menstrual cycle, progesterone induces final maturation of the uterine endometrium for reception and implantation of the fertilized ovum.

## THE OVARIAN CYCLE: FOLLICULOGENESIS, OVULATION, AND FORMATION OF THE CORPUS LUTEUM

## Female reproductive life span is determined by the number of primordial follicles established during fetal life

Unlike the male-which produces large numbers of mature gametes (sperm) continuously beginning at puberty and for the remainder of the man's life-the female has a limited total number of gametes, determined by the number of oocytes formed during fetal life (see p. 1078). Oocyte maturationthe production of a haploid female gamete capable of fertilization by a sperm-begins in the fetal ovary. Beginning at around the fourth week of gestation, primordial germ cells migrate from the endoderm of the yolk sac to the gonadal ridge (see Fig. 53-4B and C), where they develop into oogonia-immature germ cells that proliferate by mitosis.

Primary Oocytes By $\sim 8$ weeks' gestation, $\sim 300,000$ oogonia are present in each ovary. At around this time, some oogonia enter prophase of meiosis I and become primary

oocytes (Fig. 55-10A). From this point onward, the number of germ cells is determined by three ongoing processes: mitosis, meiosis, and death by apoptosis (see p. 1241). By 20 weeks, all the mitotic divisions of the female germ cells have been completed, and the total number of germ cells peaks at 6 to 7 million. All oogonia that have not already entered prophase of meiosis I by the 28th to 30th week of gestation die by apoptosis. The oocytes then arrest in the diplotene stage of prophase I. This prolonged state of meiotic arrest is known as the dictyotene state, which lasts until just before ovulation many years later, when the meiosis resumes and the first polar body is extruded. The second meiotic division occurs at syngamy (see p. 1072), at which stage maturation of the haploid oocyte is complete.

Primordial Follicles In the fetal ovary, dictyotene oocytes are surrounded by a single layer of flat, spindle-shaped pregranulosa cells to form a primordial follicle (see Fig. 55-10B). Each primordial follicle is 30 to $60 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter and enclosed by a basement membrane. By the 30th week of gestation, the ovaries contain around 5 to 6 million primordial follicles. Unlike male gametes, new oocytes cannot form after this time because all gametogenic stem cells, in this case oogonia, have either died or entered meiosis. Therefore, by midgestation, the female gamete endowment is established. For the remainder of the female's life, the number of primordial follicles gradually decreases. One reason for the decline is that primordial follicles undergo a relentless process of apoptosis that begins at midgestation and ends at menopause when the endowment of primordial follicles is virtually exhausted. This progressive exhaustion is independent of gonadotropic hormones and is unaffected by pregnancy or the use of oral contraceptives. In addition, after puberty, each month a cohort of 10 to 30 primordial follicles is recruited to enter the irreversible process of folliculogenesis, which culminates in either ovulation (rupture of the follicle and expulsion of the ova) or atresia (a coordinated process in which the oocyte and other follicle cells undergo apoptosis, degeneration, and resorption). The mechanism by which some primordial follicles initiate folliculogenesis whereas others remain dormant is not known. Thus, even though the ovaries are invested with $\sim 7$ million oogonia at midgestation, the pool of primordial follicles is continually depleted, so that $\sim 1$ million exist at birth, $\sim 300,000$ remain at puberty, and there are virtually none at menopause. Of the $\sim 300,000$ primordial follicles present at puberty, only 400 to 500 are destined for ovulation between puberty and menopause (e.g., 12 per year for 40 years). Another 5000 to 15,000 are part of the monthly cohorts that undergo atresia. However, the vast majority of primordial and primary ovarian follicles are lost as a result of the rapid, continuous process of atresia during the reproductive life of the individual.

The female gametes are stored in the ovarian folliclesthe primary functional units of the ovary. Over the course of a female's life, $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of all primordial follicles never progress into folliculogenesis. Primordial follicles are dormant for most of their life. At any given time, a small proportion of primordial follicles begins a series of changes in size, morphology, and function referred to as folliculogenesis-the central event in the human female reproductive system.

factors within the ovary and by the gonadotropins (FSH and LH)-occurs by three processes: (1) enlargement and maturation of the oocyte, (2) differentiation and proliferation of granulosa and theca cells, and (3) formation and accumulation of a fluid.

Primary Follicles The first step in folliculogenesis is the emergence of a primordial follicle from its quiescent state to become a primary follicle (see Fig. 55-10C). This process involves proliferation of granulosa cells and their differentiation from flattened pregranulosa cells to cuboidal cells. In addition, the oocyte increases in size and forms the zona pellucida-a glycoprotein shell surrounding the plasma membrane of the oocyte.

Secondary Follicles The further proliferation of granulosa cells and the appearance of the theca-cell layer converts the primary follicle into a secondary follicle (see Fig. 55-10D). Secondary follicles contain a primary oocyte surrounded by several layers of cuboidal granulosa cells. In addition, cells in the ovarian stroma surrounding the follicle are induced to differentiate into theca cells that populate the outside of the follicle's basement membrane. The oocyte increases in size to a mean diameter of $\sim 80 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ and the follicular diameter grows to 110 to $120 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. As the developing follicle increases in size-becoming a late-stage secondary follicle-the number of granulosa cells increases to $\sim 600$ and the theca cells show increasing differentiation to form the theca interna layer closest to the granulosa and the theca externa that compresses the surrounding ovarian stroma. Progression to secondary follicles also involves the formation of a blood supply from arterioles that terminate in a wreath-like network of capillaries adjacent to the basement membrane surrounding the granulosa-cell layer, which remains avascular. The theca cells proliferate and acquire LH receptors, as well as the ability to synthesize steroids. Gap junctions also form between the oocyte and the adjacent layer of granulosa cells and between granulosa cells. The oocyte-granulosa junctions may function as thoroughfares to transport nutrients and information from the granulosa cells to the oocyte and vice versa. The granulosa cells in this context are analogous to the Sertoli cells (see pp. 1101-1102) in that they nurse the gamete and act as the barrier between the oocyte and the blood supply.

Tertiary Follicles The next stage of follicular growth is the maturation of secondary follicles into tertiary follicles (see Fig. 55-10E) as the increasingly abundant granulosa cells secrete fluid into the center of the follicle to form a fluidfilled space called the antrum. Tertiary follicles represent the first of two antral stages (the second being the graafian follicle, below). FSH induces the transition of preantral secondary follicles to antral tertiary follicles.

Graafian Follicles As the antrum enlarges, it nearly encircles the oocyte, except for a small mound or cumulus that attaches the oocyte to the rest of the follicle. At this second antral stage, the diameter of the follicle increases to 20 to 33 mm and it is called a preovulatory or graafian follicle (see Fig. 55-10F).

The granulosa cells of the tertiary and graafian follicles are of three types: (1) Mural granulosa cells, which are the
farthest from the center of the follicle, are the most metabolically active and contain large quantities of LH receptors and enzymes that are necessary for the synthesis of steroids. (2) Cumulus granulosa cells are shed with the oocyte at the time of ovulation. (3) Antral granulosa cells, which face the antrum, are left behind within the follicle to become the large luteal cells of the corpus luteum. The capacity of the three types of granulosa cells to generate steroids differs. Cumulus cells contain neither the side-chain-cleavage enzyme ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{\text {SCC }}$ ) nor aromatase ( $\mathrm{P}-450_{\text {arom }}$ ) and therefore cannot generate estrogens. Moreover, cumulus cells respond less to LH and have a low overall LH receptor content. The exact role of the cumulus layer has not been definitively established, although investigators have postulated that the cumulus layer may function as a feeder layer and may provide stem cells that differentiate into other granulosa-cell types.

The antral fluid provides a unique environment for oocyte growth and development. It facilitates the release of the oocyte-cumulus at the time of ovulation and serves as a medium for nutrient exchange and waste removal in the avascular compartment. The accumulation of antral fluid is a major factor in the formation of the dominant follicle. Between 5 and 6 days before ovulation the dominant follicle undergoes accelerated expansion, forming a cystic bulge on the surface of the ovary. After this final phase of growth, the follicle-now a graafian follicle-is prepared for ovulation (see Fig. 55-10G).

## The oocyte grows and matures during folliculogenesis

The principal role of folliculogenesis is to produce a mature oocyte that is capable of fertilization and formation of an embryo. The oocyte contributes the majority of the cytoplasmic and nuclear factors needed for embryo development, and these factors are not completely established until after the secondary follicle stage (see Fig. 55-10D). In addition, oocyte growth and maturation benefits from the gap junctions that connect cumulus granulosa cells to the oocyte, permitting the bidirectional exchange of nutrients, growth factors, and other molecules. Oocyte growth and maturation includes formation of the zona pellucida, formation of increased numbers of mitochondria, acquisition of competence to complete meiosis I. During maturation, the oocyte also re-establishes genomic imprints. Genomic imprinting (see p. 94) is the process by which certain genes-about $1 \%$ of the genome-are silenced; particular genes are silenced only in female gametes and others, only in male gametes.

## FSH and LH stimulate the growth of a cohort of follicles

As described above, the development of primordial follicles to secondary follicles occurs continually from fetal life until menopause. However, almost all of these follicles undergo atresia (death of the ovum, followed by collapse of the follicle and scarring) at some stage in their development. This gonadotropin-independent folliculogenesis and atresia is thought to be controlled by factors within the ovary, and especially between somatic cells and the oocyte, acting in a paracrine manner. Some key factors in this process are activin A, the forkhead transcription factor FOXO3, basic fibroblast growth factor, and kit ligand.

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep, Walter Boron, and Sam Mesiano

Genomic imprinting is the process by which certain genesabout $1 \%$ of the genome-are silenced; particular genes are silenced only in female gametes and others, only in male gametes. Thus, these genes are expressed in a manner specific to the parent of origin.

Note that a female diploid oogonium has some paternal genes imprinted or silenced (i.e., only the maternal gene is active) and some maternal genes silenced (i.e., only the paternal gene is active). When the 2 N genome splits into two 1 N genomes, it is important that all genes in the oocyte have the female pattern of imprinting, which occurs during oocyte maturation.

Failure of proper genomic imprinting causes aberrant gene expression and is associated with several human diseases, including Beckwith-Wiedemann, Prader-Willi, and Angelman syndromes. For example, the IGF2 gene is normally mater-nally imprinted (i.e., silenced). In Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome, the material IGF2 gene becomes reactivated (by removal of methyl tags) during oocyte formation in the mother or early embryonic development. The result is that the offspring has two (rather than one) active copies of IGF2 and thus excess IGF2 protein. The most obvious sign is macrosomia (large body size) in the newborn.

At the time of puberty, increased levels of FSH and LH stimulate cohorts of secondary follicles to progress to the tertiary and preovulatory stages. Along the course of this development, most follicles undergo atresia until one dominant graafian follicle remains at the time of ovulation. Controversy exists about the length of this developmental process. Some believe that the entire developmental process occurs over three to four monthly cycles, so that the graafian follicle of the present ovulatory cycle was part of a cohort of secondary follicles recruited three to four cycles earlier. An alternative view is that FSH and LH induce the recruitment of a cohort of follicles during the end of one cycle, and one of these follicles develops into the dominant graafian follicle in the next cycle. In any case, FSH is necessary for continued development of follicles beyond the secondary stage, and only a portion of the cohort of follicles continues to develop in response to FSH and LH. The other follicles undergo atresia.

## Each month, one follicle achieves dominance

Although the mechanism of selection of the dominant follicle is not completely understood, it is thought to be caused by estrogen-induced events within the follicles. As estrogen levels rise during the follicular phase of the cycle, the pituitary gradually lowers its secretion of FSH (see Fig. 55-6). Rising inhibin levels also feed back on the anterior pituitary to decrease FSH secretion. Peak inhibin levels correlate with the number of follicles present and rise in parallel with circulating estradiol levels.

Decreased levels of FSH cause a decline in FSH-dependent aromatase activity in granulosa cells (see p. 1117), which results in a decrease in estradiol production in the lessmature follicles (see Fig. 55-8). Conversely, estrogen increases the effectiveness of FSH in the more mature follicles by increasing the number of FSH receptors. The dominant follicle therefore has more FSH receptors, a greater rate of granulosa-cell proliferation, more FSH-dependent aromatase activity, and more estrogen production than the less dominant follicles. Because the less dominant follicles have less aromatase activity, they convert less androstenedione to estradiol. Thus, the weak androgen androstenedione either builds up or is converted to other androgens. As a result, the less dominant follicles have a lower estrogen/androgen ratio than the dominant follicle, and they undergo atresia under the influence of androgens in their local environment. In contrast, the production of estradiol and inhibins allows the dominant follicle to become prominent and to gain an even greater edge over its competitors. The vascular supply to the theca of the dominant follicle also increases rapidly, which may allow greater FSH delivery to the dominant follicle and thus help to maintain dominance of the follicle selected for ovulation.

## Estradiol secretion by the dominant follicle triggers the LH surge and thus ovulation

Ovulation occurs at the midpoint of every normal menstrual cycle, triggered by the LH surge, which in turn is stimulated by rapidly rising levels of estradiol. Estradiol secretion by the dominant follicle increases rapidly near the end of the late follicular phase (see Fig. 55-6). This dramatic rise in
circulating estradiol switches the negative-feedback response of estradiol on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary to a positive-feedback response and also sensitizes the anterior pituitary to GnRH. The result is the LH surge, which generally begins 24 to 36 hours after peak estradiol secretion. Ovulation usually occurs $\sim 36$ hours after onset of the LH surge, and $\sim 12$ hours after its peak. Thus, it appears that the developing follicle, through its increased estradiol secretion, signals the hypothalamic-pituitary system that follicular maturation is complete and that the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can now release a bolus of gonadotropin to induce ovulation. The LH surge appears to terminate in part as a result of rising levels of progesterone, through negative feedback, and in part as a result of loss of the positive feedback that is derived from estradiol. Depletion of gonadotropin stores in the anterior pituitary gland may also contribute to termination of the LH surge.

At the time of the LH surge, the primary oocyte ( 4 N DNA), which had been arrested in the prophase of its first meiotic division since fetal life (see Fig. 53-2C), now resumes meiosis and completes its first meiotic division several hours before ovulation. The result of this first meiotic division is a small first polar body, which degenerates or divides to form nonfunctional cells, and a much larger secondary oocyte. Both the first polar body and the secondary oocyte, like secondary spermatocytes (see p. 1100), have a haploid number of duplicated chromosomes (2N DNA): 22 duplicated somatic chromosomes and 1 duplicated X chromosome. This secondary oocyte begins its second meiotic division, but it becomes arrested in metaphase until the time of fertilization (see pp. 1131-1132). The secondary oocyte is surrounded by the zona pellucida and one or more layers of follicular cells, the corona radiata. Before ovulation, the cumulus oophorus expands under the influence of LH, and eventually the oocyte and its surrounding cells break free from the inner follicular-cell layer and, with their "stalk," float inside the antrum, surrounded by follicular fluid. Breaking away of the oocyte-cumulus complex is probably facilitated by increased hyaluronidase synthesis that is stimulated by FSH.

Release of the oocyte from the follicle-ovulationfollows thinning and weakening of the follicular wall, probably under the influence of LH, progesterone, and prostaglandins (particularly those in the E and F series). These agents enhance the activity of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., collagenase) within the follicle, which leads to the digestion of connective tissue in the follicular wall. Ultimately, a stigma-or spot-forms on the surface of the dominant follicle, in an area devoid of blood vessels. As this stigma balloons out under the influence of increased follicular pressure and forms a vesicle, it ruptures and the oocyte is expelled.

The expelled oocyte, with its investment of follicular cells, is guided toward the fallopian tube by the fimbriae that cover the surface of the nearby ovary (see Fig. 55-1). The oocyte is then transported through the infundibulum into the ampulla by ciliary movement of the tubal epithelium, as well as by muscular contractions of the tube. Fertilization, if it occurs, takes place in the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube. The resulting zygote resides in the ampulla for $\sim 72$ hours, followed by rapid transport through the isthmus to the uterine cavity, where it floats free for an additional 2 to 3 days before attaching to the endometrium.

## After ovulation, theca and granulosa cells of the follicle differentiate into theca-lutein and granulosa-lutein cells of the corpus luteum

After expulsion of the oocyte, the remaining follicular granulosa and theca cells coalesce into folds that occupy the follicular cavity and, under the influence of LH, undergo a phenotypic transformation to form the corpus luteum-a temporary endocrine organ whose major product is progesterone. The mature corpus luteum is composed of two cell types, granulosa-lutein cells (also known as large luteal cells) derived from the granulosa cells, and theca-lutein cells (also known as small luteal cells) derived from the theca cell. The corpus luteum is highly vascularized, consistent with its primary function as an endocrine organ. During the early luteal phase, progesterone and estradiol produced by the corpus luteum exert negative feedback on the hypothalamicpituitary axis to suppress gonadotropin secretion and thus inhibit folliculogenesis. If pregnancy is not established, the corpus luteum regresses $\sim 11$ days after ovulation. One possible mechanism for this regression-or luteolysis-is that withdrawal of trophic support results in demise of the corpus luteum. A second possibility is that local factors, such as prostaglandin $\mathrm{F}_{2 \alpha}$ produced by the endometrium, inhibit luteal function and terminate the life of the corpus luteum.

## Growth and involution of the corpus luteum produce the rise and fall in estradiol and progesterone during the luteal phase

Although the corpus luteum produces both estradiol and progesterone, the luteal phase is dominated by progesterone secretion. Estradiol production by the corpus luteum is largely a function of the theca-lutein cells because they produce the androgens that move to the granulosa-lutein cells (see Fig. 55-9) for conversion to estradiol. Progesterone production in the corpus luteum is primarily a function of the granulosa-lutein cells (see Fig. 55-9).

Progesterone production rises modestly before follicular rupture but increases sharply after ovulation, peaking in $\sim 7$ days. Progesterone acts locally to inhibit follicular growth during the luteal phase. In addition, progesterone may act centrally by inhibiting gonadotropin secretion. Progesterone is also an antiestrogen in that it inhibits expression of ERs, thereby reducing estrogen responsiveness. The net effect is that increasing progesterone production suppresses folliculogenesis.

Estradiol levels also rise during the luteal phase (see Fig. 55-6), which reflects production by the corpus luteum. Because estrogens induce expression of PRs in target cells, the estradiol produced during the luteal phase is necessary for progesterone-induced changes in the endometrium.

Unless rescued by hCG - produced by the syncytial trophoblasts of the blastocyst (see p. 1136)-luteal production of progesterone ceases toward the end of the menstrual cycle. hCG produced by the developing conceptus maintains steroidogenic function of the corpus luteum until approximately the ninth week of gestation, at which time placental function is well established. If not rescued by pregnancy, the hormone-producing cells of the corpus luteum degenerate and leave behind a fibrotic corpus albicans.

## THE ENDOMETRIAL CYCLE

In the human female fetus, the uterine mucosa is capable of responding to steroid hormones by the 20th week of gestation. Indeed, some of the uterine glands begin secreting material by the 22 nd week of gestation. Endometrial development in utero apparently occurs in response to estrogens derived from the maternal placenta. By the 32nd week of gestation, glycogen deposition and stromal edema are present in the endometrium. As estrogenic stimulation is withdrawn after delivery, the endometrium regresses, and at $\sim 4$ weeks after birth, the glands are atrophic and lack vascularization. The endometrium remains in this state until puberty.

## The ovarian hormones drive the morphological and functional changes of the endometrium during the monthly cycle

The ovarian steroids—primarily estradiol and progesteronecontrol the cyclic monthly growth and breakdown of the endometrium. The endometrial cycle has three major phases: the menstrual, proliferative, and secretory phases.

The Menstrual Phase If the oocyte was not fertilized and pregnancy did not occur in the previous cycle, a sudden diminution in estradiol and progesterone secretion will signal the demise of the corpus luteum. As hormonal support of the endometrium is withdrawn, the vascular and glandular integrity of the endometrium degenerates, the tissue breaks down, and menstrual bleeding ensues; this moment is defined as the start of day 1 of the menstrual cycle (Fig. 55-11). After menstruation, all that remains on the inner surface of most of the uterus is a thin layer of nonepithelial stromal cells and some remnant glands. However, epithelial cells remain in the lower uterine segments as well as regions close to the fallopian tubes.

The Proliferative Phase After menstruation, the endometrium is restored by about the fifth day of the cycle (see Fig. 55-11) as a result of proliferation of the basal stromal cells on the denuded surface of the uterus (the zona basalis) as well as the proliferation of epithelial cells from other parts of the uterus. The stroma gives rise to the connective tissue components of the endometrium. Increased mitotic activity of the stromal and glandular epithelium continues throughout the follicular phase of the cycle and beyond, until $\sim 3$ days after ovulation. Cellular hyperplasia and increased extracellular matrix result in thickening of the endometrium during the late proliferative phase. The thickness of the endometrium increases from $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~mm}$ to as much as 5 mm during the proliferative phase.

Proliferation and differentiation of the endometrium are stimulated by estrogen that is secreted by the developing follicles. Levels of estrogen rise early in the follicular phase and peak just before ovulation (see Fig. 55-6). ER levels in the endometrium also increase during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. Levels of endometrial ER are highest during the proliferative phase and decline after ovulation in response to changing levels of progesterone.

Estradiol is believed to act on the endometrium in part through its effect on the expression of proto-oncogenes (see

![bo420346323f](bo420346323f.jpg)

Figure 55-11 Endometrial cycle. The ovarian cycle includes the follicular phase (in which the follicle develops) and the luteal phase (in which the remaining follicular cells develop into the corpus luteum). The endometrial cycle has three parts: the menstrual, the proliferative, and the secretory phases.
p. 70). Estradiol also stimulates the synthesis of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs; see p. 996), transforming growth factors (TGFs), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) by endometrial cells that then act in an autocrine and paracrine manner to induce maturation and growth of the endometrium. Estradiol also induces the synthesis of PRs in endometrial tissue. Levels of PRs peak at ovulation, when estradiol levels are highest, to prepare the cells for the high progesterone levels of the luteal phase of the cycle.

Progesterone, in contrast, opposes the action of estradiol on the epithelial cells of the endometrium by inhibiting ER expression and stimulating expression of $17 \beta$-HSD and sulfotransferase. $17 \beta$-HSD converts estradiol to estrone (see Fig. 55-8), which is a weaker estrogen. Sulfotransferase conjugates estrogens to sulfate, making them biologically inactive.

The Secretory Phase During the early luteal phase of the ovarian cycle, progesterone further stimulates the $17 \beta$ HSD and sulfation reactions (see above) and decreases ER levels in endometrial cells. These three antiestrogenic effects halt the proliferative phase of the endometrial cycle. Progesterone also stimulates the glandular components of the endometrium and thus induces secretory changes in the endometrium. The epithelial cells exhibit a marked increase in secretory activity, as indicated by increased amounts of endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria. These increases
in synthetic activity occur in anticipation of the arrival and implantation of the blastocyst. The early secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (see Fig. 55-11) is characterized by the development of a network of interdigitating tubes within the nucleolus-the nucleolar channel system-of the endometrial epithelial cells.

During the middle to late secretory phase, the secretory capacity of the endometrial glands increases. Vascularization of the endometrium increases, the glycogen content increases, and the thickness of the endometrium increases to 5 to 6 mm . The endometrial glands become engorged with secretions. They are no longer straight; instead, they become tortuous and achieve maximal secretory activity at approximately day 20 or 21 of the menstrual cycle.

The changes in the endometrium are not limited to the glands; they also occur in the stromal cells between the glands. Beginning 9 to 10 days after ovulation, stromal cells that surround the spiral arteries of the uterus enlarge and develop eosinophilic cytoplasm, with a prominent Golgi complex and endoplasmic reticulum. This process is referred to as predecidualization. Under the influence of progesterone, spindle-shaped stromal cells become rounded decidual cells and form an extracellular matrix consisting of laminin, fibronectin, heparin sulfate, and type IV collagen. Multiple foci of decidual cells spread throughout the upper layer of the endometrium and form a dense layer called the zona compacta (see Fig. 55-11). This spreading is so extensive that the glandular structures of the zona compacta

become inconspicuous. Inflammatory cells accumulate around glands and blood vessels. Edema of the midzone of the endometrium distinguishes the compact area from the underlying zona spongiosa, where the endometrial glands become more prominent.

Together, the superficial zona compacta and the midlevel zona spongiosa make up the so-called functional layer of the endometrium. This functional layer is the region that proliferates early in the monthly endometrial cycle, that later interacts with the embryo during pregnancy, that is shed after pregnancy, and that is also shed each month during menstruation. The deepest layer of the endometrium-the zona basalis-is the layer left behind after parturition or menstruation. The cells of the zona basalis give rise to the proliferation at the beginning of the next endometrial cycle.

During the late luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, just before the next menstruation, levels of both estrogens and progestins diminish, and these decreased ovarian steroid levels lead to eventual demise of the upper two thirds of the endometrium. During this period, the spiral arteries rhythmically go into spasm and then relax. This period of the cycle is sometimes referred to as the ischemic phase. As cells begin to die, hydrolases are released from lysosomes and cause further breakdown of the endometrium. Prostaglandin production increases as a result of the action of phospholipases liberated from lysosomes. Necrosis of vascular cells leads to microhemorrhage. The average loss of blood, tissues, and serous fluid amounts to $\sim 30 \mathrm{~mL}$. Menstrual blood does not clot because of the presence of fibrolysins released from necrotic endometrial tissue.

## The effective implantation window is 3 to 4 days

Based on studies of embryo transfer to recipient mothers in oocyte donation programs (see Box 56-1) when both the age of the donated embryo and the time of the endometrial cycle of the recipient are known, the period of endometrial receptivity for implantation of the embryo is estimated to extend from as early as day 16 to as late as day 19 of the menstrual cycle. Of course, because implantation must normally follow the ovulation that occurs on day 14 and because fertilization normally occurs within 1 day of ovulation, the effective window is $<4$ days, from day 16 to day 19. In contrast, when embryos are transferred on cycle days 20 through 24, no pregnancies are achieved. (5) N55-7

Although the mechanisms underlying endometrial receptivity remain unclear, the formation of microvilli and pinopods (i.e., protrusions of endometrial cells near gland openings) during the midluteal phase and the secretion of extracellular matrix composed of materials such as glycoproteins, laminin, and fibronectin may provide a surface that facilitates attachment of the embryo (see pp. 1135-1136).

## FEMALE SEX ACT

Female sexual desire-libido-is a complex phenomenon that includes physical and psychological effects, all modulated by circulating sex steroids. Libido varies during the ovarian cycle, and the frequency of female sexual activity increases around the time of ovulation. There may also be an
increase in the rate of initiation of sexual activity by women around the time of ovulation. These changes may, in part, reflect the increased secretion of androgenic steroids that occurs just before and during ovulation secondary to the LH surge.

## The female sex response occurs in four distinct phases

Although sexual function has a strong physiological basis, it is not possible to separate sexual response from the other emotional and contributing factors involved in sexual relationships. (5) N55-8 The four stages of the sex response in women are excitement or seduction, plateau, orgasm, and resolution.

Excitement The excitement or arousal phase of the female sex response may be initiated by a multitude of internal or external stimuli, including psychological factors, such as thoughts and emotions, and physical factors, such as sight and tactile stimuli. Table 55-2 summarizes the responses of the excitement phase, many of which reflect activity of the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Sexual intensity rises in crescendo fashion.

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

The numerical values presented on page 1126 for the implantation window (days 16 to 19 of the cycle) come from embryo-transfer studies in which the woman has received gonadotropins to overstimulate the ovary to enhance the development of many ova, and then received hCG to mimic the LH surge (see Box 56-1). As discussed on pages 11321133, in a natural menstrual cycle that involves fertilization, the implantation takes place 6 to 7 days after ovulation, that is, between days 20 and 21.

## N55-8 Kinsey, and Masters and Johnson

## Contributed by Ed Moczydlowski

Masters and Johnson, in their now classic work Human Sexual Response, published a discussion of data obtained on the sexual cycles of 700 subjects. Our current understanding of the female sex response is based on their findings. Masters and Johnson described four stages of the sex response in women: excitement or seduction, plateau, orgasm, and resolution. A brief description of each stage is provided in the text. Masters and Johnson suggested that prolonged stimulation during the excitement phase leads to more pronounced orgasmic activity.

This work by Masters and Johnson followed the so-called Kinsey Reports by Alfred C. Kinsey and coworkers, who wrote Sexual Behavior of the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior of the Human Female (1953).

Plateau The plateau stage is the culmination of the excitement phase as it reaches its peak. It is associated with a marked degree of vasocongestion throughout the body.

Orgasm During orgasm, the sexual tension that has built up in the entire body is released. The climax, or orgasm, is intense and includes a myotonic response throughout the body. Muscle contractions start 2 to 4 seconds after the woman begins to experience orgasm, and they repeat at 0.8 -second intervals. The actual number of contractions, as well as their intensity, varies from woman to woman. Some women observed to have orgasmic contractions are not aware that they are having an orgasm. Whereas the excitement phase is under the influence of the parasympathetic division of the ANS, as is the erection phase in men, orgasm seems to be related to the sympathetic division, as is the emission phase in men (see pp. 1106-1107).

Resolution The last phase of the female sex response is a return of the woman's physiological state to the preexcitement level. During the resolution phase, the woman generally experiences a feeling of personal satisfaction, wellbeing, and relaxation of sexual desire. A new sexual excitement cycle may be initiated at any time after orgasm without the refractory phase that occurs in men.

## Both the sympathetic and the parasympathetic divisions control the female sex response

Much of the response in the excitement phase results from stimulation of the parasympathetic fibers of the ANS. In some cases, anticholinergic drugs may interfere with a full response in this stage. Dilatation of blood vessels in the erectile tissues causes engorgement with blood and erection of the clitoris, as well as distention of the peri-introital tissues and subsequent narrowing of the lower third of the vagina. Parasympathetic fibers emanating from the sacral plexus (see p. 339) innervate these erectile tissues, just as in men (see pp. 1105-1106). In addition, the parasympathetic system innervates Bartholin's glands, which empty into the introitus, as well as the vaginal glands. Adequate lubrication is necessary to minimize the friction of intercourse and thus maximize the stimulation to achieve orgasm.

Both physical and psychological stimuli are important for female orgasm. Psychological stimuli are coordinated via the cerebrum, which causes the generalized tension throughout the body, as discussed above, and also modulates the autonomic response. The female orgasm is also coordinated via a spinal cord reflex that results in rhythmic contractions of the perineal muscles. The afferent pathways for this spinal cord reflex follow the pudendal nerves, which emanate via sacral segments 2 to 4 and are the primary innervation to the perineum and the female external genitalia. This spinal cord reflex is similar to that observed in men.

## The female sex response facilitates sperm transport through the female reproductive tract

The spinal reflexes previously discussed may also increase uterine and cervical activity and may thus promote trans-
port of gametes. The cervix dilates during orgasm, which facilitates sperm transport into the upper part of the reproductive tract. The release of oxytocin at the time of orgasm stimulates uterine contractility, which also facilitates gamete transport. Although 150 to 600 million sperm cells (see p. 1103) are normally deposited in the vagina during sexual intercourse, $\sim 100,000$ reach the cavity of the uterus and only 50 to 100 viable sperm reach the distal fallopian tube where fertilization occurs. Aside from the one or more sperm that will fertilize the ovum (or ova), most sperm degenerate, to be disposed of by the female genital tract. Sperm transport is accomplished by swimming movements of the sperm tail through the mucus of the cervical canal. The sperm reach the ampulla of the fallopian tubes within 5 minutes of ejaculation. Clearly, this rapid rate of transport could not be achieved by the swimming activity of the sperm alone. Therefore, uterine or tubal activity must play a major role in sperm transport.

## MENOPAUSE

Menopause, or the climacteric, signals the termination of reproductive function in women. Cyclic reproductive function ceases, menstruation comes to an end, and childbearing is generally no longer possible. Also occurring are significant physiological changes (Table 55-3) that have a major impact on health.

## Only a few functioning follicles remain in the ovaries of a menopausal woman

Progressive loss of ovarian follicular units occurs throughout life (see pp. 1120-1121). In the United States, puberty generally occurs at an age of $\sim 12.5$ years (see p. 1088) and menopause at 51.5 years. At menopause and during the ensuing 5 years, the ovary contains only an occasional secondary follicle and a few primary follicles in a prominent stroma. The massive loss of oocytes over the reproductive life of a woman-from 300,000 at puberty (see p. 1121) to virtually none at menopause-is the result of the process of atresia during reproductive life.

# BOX 55-4 Hormone Replacement Therapy During Menopause 

Although the mean age at menopause is $\sim 51.5$ years, changes in hormone secretion patterns begin much earlier. Increases in levels of FSH occur as early as 35 years of age. The mechanisms responsible for this change remain to be elucidated. However, it is clear that ovarian function begins to diminish far in advance of a woman's last menstrual period. The increase in gonadotropin secretion is probably a result of decreased folliculogenesis leading to decreased secretion of sex steroids and inhibin and thus lowered negative feedback on the gonadotrophs during the perimenopausal period.

The characteristic changes associated with menopause are primarily the result of low circulating estrogen levels. Estrogens are very important regulatory hormones in females. In addition to their roles in reproductive processes, these hormones have profound effects on several other physiological systems (see Table 55-3).

Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is indicated during menopause to alleviate menopausal syndrome and to prevent or diminish the physical changes that occur as a result of estrogen deficiency. Menopausal HRT consists of estrogen and progestin administration. The reason for administering progestins is that the endometrium is at significant risk of neoplasia from
unopposed actions of estrogens. Thus, progestins are not generally administered to women who have had hysterectomies. Estrogen replacement is very effective against menopausal syndrome as well as against osteoporosis. However, because of side effects (e.g., menstruation) and concern about endometrial and breast cancer, compliance with HRT is often compromised.

The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) comprise a group of structurally dissimilar compounds that interact with ERs. SERMs act as either estrogen agonists or estrogen antagonists, depending on the target tissue and hormonal status of the individual. The mechanisms by which SERMs elicit their sometimes opposite effects in specific tissues are complex. SERMs such as tamoxifen and raloxifene have estrogen-agonist effects on bone and the cardiovascular system, but estrogenantagonist effects in reproductive tissue. The estrogen-antagonist effects of SERMs may reflect classic competition for ERs. The ideal SERM for HRT would have all the beneficial effects of estrogens-including alleviating menopausal syndrome, protecting against cardiovascular and Alzheimer disease, and acting as estrogen agonists in certain reproductive tissues-without their carcinogenic side effects.

## During menopause, levels of the ovarian steroids fall, whereas gonadotropin levels rise

The loss of functional ovarian follicles is primarily responsible for menopause in primates. Even before the onset of menopause, significant hormonal changes occur very early during reproductive life. Because of a gradual decline in the number of follicles, the decreased ovarian production of estradiol reduces the negative feedback to the anterior pituitary and leads to increased levels of FSH. Increased levels of FSH are seen as early as 35 years of age, even though cyclic reproductive function continues. When compared with younger women, older-but premenopausal-women have diminished estradiol production and decreased luteal function during natural cycles. Diminished inhibin production by the aging ovary may also contribute to the sharp rise in FSH levels that occurs in the perimenopausal period of life (see Fig. 53-11A).

During menopause, estradiol levels are generally $<30 \mathrm{pg} /$ mL , and progesterone levels are often $<1 \mathrm{ng} / \mathrm{mL}$ of plasma. Both these values are somewhat less than the lowest levels seen during the menstrual cycle of a younger woman
(see Fig. 55-6). Ovarian production of androstenedione is minimal during menopause, although androstenedione production by the adrenal cortex remains normal.

Because the output of estrogens, progestins, and inhibins from the ovaries falls to very low levels during menopause, negative feedback on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (see Fig. 55-3) becomes minimal. As a result, levels of FSH and LH may be higher than those seen during the midcycle surge in premenopausal women-the futile attempt of the axis to stimulate follicular development and production of the female sex steroids. During menopause, the anterior pituitary still secretes FSH and LH in pulses, presumably after cyclic release of GnRH from the hypothalamus (see Fig. 53-11A). Although gonadotropins cannot generally stimulate the postmenopausal ovary, it appears that the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary can respond to exogenous GnRH (Box 55-4).

# FERTILIZATION, PREGNANCY, AND LACTATION 

Sam Mesiano and Ervin E. Jones

## TRANSPORT OF GAMETES AND FERTILIZATION

## Cilia and smooth muscle transport the egg and sperm within the female genital tract

Following ovulation, the fimbriae of the fallopian tube sweep over the ovarian surface and pick up the oocyte-surrounded by its complement of granulosa cells, the cumulus oophorus, and corona radiata (see p. 1122)—and deposit it in the fallopian tube. Shortly after ovulation, movements of the cilia and the smooth muscle of fallopian tube propel the oocytecumulus complex toward the uterus.

A man normally deposits 150 to 600 million sperm cells into the vagina at the time of ejaculation. Only 50 to 100 of these cells actually reach the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube, where fertilization normally occurs. However, the sperm get there very quickly, within $\sim 5$ minutes of ejaculation. The swimming motion of the sperm alone cannot account for such rapid transport. Forceful contractions of the uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes propel the sperm into the upper reproductive tract during female orgasm. Prostaglandins in the seminal plasma may induce further contractile activity.

## The "capacitation" of the spermatozoa that occurs in the female genital tract enhances the ability of the sperm cell to fertilize the ovum

Maturation of sperm continues while they are stored in the epididymis (see pp. 1102-1103). In most species, neither freshly ejaculated sperm cells nor sperm cells that are removed from the epididymis are capable of fertilizing the egg until these cells have undergone further maturation-capacitation-in the female reproductive tract or in the laboratory. Capacitation is a poorly understood physiological process by which spermatozoa acquire the ability to penetrate the zona pellucida of the ovum. The removal or modification of a protective protein coat from the sperm cell membrane appears to be an important molecular event in the process of capacitation. (5) NS6-0

Sperm cells do not need to pass through the cervix and uterus to achieve capacitation. Successful pregnancy can occur with gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), in which spermatozoa and oocytes are placed directly into the ampulla of the fallopian tube, and also with direct ultrasoundguided intraperitoneal insemination, in which the sperm are
deposited in the peritoneal cavity, near the fimbria. Thus, capacitation of sperm in the reproductive tract is not strictly organ specific. As evidenced by the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and embryo transfer (ET)-discussed in Box 56-1-capacitation is possible even if the sperm does not make contact with the female reproductive tract.

Fertilization begins as the sperm cell attaches to the zona pellucida and undergoes the acrosomal reaction, and it ends with the fusion of the male and female pronuclei

After ovulation, the egg in the fallopian tube is in a semidormant state. If it remains unfertilized, the ripe egg will remain quiescent for some time and eventually degenerate. When fertilization occurs, the sperm normally comes into contact with the oocyte in the ampullary portion of the tube, usually several hours after ovulation. Fertilization causes the egg to awaken (activation) and initiates a series of morphological and biochemical events that lead to cell division and differentiation. Fertilization occurs in eight steps:

Step 1: The sperm head weaves its way past the follicular cells and attaches to the zona pellucida that surrounds the oocyte (Fig. 56-1). The zona pellucida is composed of three glycoproteins; ZP1 cross-links the filamentous ZP2 and ZP3 into a latticework. Receptors on the plasma membrane of the sperm cell bind to ZP3, thereby initiating a signal-transduction cascade.
Step 2: As a result of the sperm-ZP3 interaction, the sperm cell undergoes the acrosomal reaction, a prelude to the migration of the sperm cell through the mucus-like zona pellucida. The acrosome (see p. 1103) is a unique sperm organelle containing hydrolyzing enzymes that are necessary for the sperm to penetrate the zona pellucida. During the acrosomal reaction, an increase in intracellular free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration $\left(\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}\right)$ triggers fusion of the outer acrosomal membrane with the sperm cell's plasma membrane, resulting in the exocytosis of most of the acrosomal contents.
Step 3: The spermatozoon penetrates through the zona pellucida. One mechanism of this penetration is the action of the acrosomal enzymes. (6) NS6-2 Protease inhibitors can block the penetration of spermatozoa through the zona pellucida. The sperm cell also penetrates the zona pellucida by mechanical action. The sperm head rapidly

## N56-0 Role of a Bicarbonate-Activated Adenylyl Cyclase in Sperm Capacitation

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

It has long been recognized that the capacitation of mammalian sperm requires both $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and adenylyl-cyclase activity, which led to the discovery of a $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-stimulated soluble adenylyl cyclase (sAC). Recall that the adenylyl cyclase activated by heterotrimeric G proteins is a membrane-bound enzyme (p. 53). In contrast, sAC is present in the cytosol.

## N56-2 Acrosomal Enzymes

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Among the many enzymes in the acrosome are acid hydrolases, the best characterized of which is proacrosin, the precursor to acrosin. Acrosin is a member of the serine protease superfamily; it is expressed only in spermatogenic cells. Two other enzymes released from the acrosome are neuraminidase and a special form of hyaluronidase. This particular hyaluronidase can be distinguished from the common lysosomal form of the enzyme, and it appears to be a spermatogenic cell-specific isozyme. Acrosin, hyaluronidase, and neuraminidase help the sperm penetrate the zona pellucida by hydrolyzing the sugar chains and the peptide chains of the glycoproteins of the zona pellucida.

# BOX 56-1 In Vitro Fertilization and Embryo Transfer 

IVF is a procedure in which an oocyte or oocytes are removed from a woman and then fertilized with sperm under laboratory conditions. Early development of the embryo also proceeds under laboratory conditions. Finally, the physician transfers one or more embryos to the uterine cavity, where the embryo will hopefully implant and develop.

## Indications for IVF-ET

Indications for IVF-ET include disorders that impair the normal meeting of the sperm and the egg in the distal portion of the fallopian tube. In addition to ovulatory dysfunction, these disorders include tubal occlusion, tubal-peritoneal adhesions, endometriosis, and other disease processes of the female peritoneal cavity. In addition, IVF-ET is indicated in some cases of malefactor infertility (abnormalities in male reproductive function) or unexplained infertility.

## Ovarian Stimulation

Because the success rates are $<100 \%$ for each of the stages of IVF-ET, the physician needs several oocytes, all obtained in a single ovarian cycle. However, woman normally develops a single dominant follicle each cycle (see p. 1123). Thus, to obtain the multiple oocytes for IVF-ET, the physician must stimulate the development of multiple follicles in the woman by controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Although this procedure qualitatively mimics the hormonal control of the normal cycle, the high dose of gonadotropins triggers the development of many follicles. The physician administers some combination of FSH and LH, or pure FSH, either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. Because exogenous gonadotropins stimulate the ovaries directly, GnRH analogs (see Box 55-2) are often used to downregulate the hypothalamicpituitary axis during controlled ovarian stimulation. One usually administers these GnRH analogs before initiating gonadotropin therapy, primarily to prevent a premature LH surge and ovulation.

## Cycle Monitoring

After administering the gonadotropins, the physician monitors the stimulated follicular growth in the ovaries with sonographic imaging. Size, number, and serial growth of ovarian follicles may be assessed daily or at other appropriate intervals. Serum estradiol levels provide an additional measure of follicular growth and function. When estradiol levels and follicular growth indicate-by established criteria-appropriate folliculogenesis, the physician simulates a natural LH surge by injecting hCG, which mimics the actions of LH (see p. 1111). However, in this case, the simulated LH surge completes the final maturation of multiple follicles and oocytes. Because ovulation usually occurs 36 to 39 hours following the beginning of the LH surge (see p. 1123), the physician plans oocyte retrieval in such a way that maximal follicular maturation can occur but the oocytes are still harvested prior to ovulation. Thus, retrievals are scheduled for 34 to 36 hours following the administration of hCG.

## Oocyte Retrieval

The physician retrieves oocytes by aspirating them from individual follicles under sonographic guidance. With the patient under conscious or unconscious sedation, and after a local anesthetic is applied to the posterior vaginal wall, the physician inserts a probe equipped with a needle guide into the vagina. After inserting a 16- to 18-gauge needle through the vaginal wall, the physician aspirates the follicular fluid from each mature follicle and collects it in a test tube containing a small amount of culture medium. The eggs are identified in the follicular fluid, are separated from the fluid and other follicular cells, and are then washed and prepared for insemination. This procedure normally yields 8 to 15 oocytes.

## Insemination

The sperm sample is subjected to numerous washes, followed by gradient centrifugation to separate the sperm cells from the other cells and from debris found in the ejaculate. Each egg is inseminated with 50,000 to 300,000 motile sperm cells in a drop of culture medium and is incubated overnight. Fertilization can usually be detected by the presence of two pronuclei in the egg cytoplasm after 16 to 20 hours. Fertilization rates generally range from $60 \%$ to $85 \%$. Embryo development is allowed to continue in vitro for another 48 to 120 hours until embryos are transferred to the uterus.

Among couples whose male partner has very low numbers of motile sperm, high fertilization rates can be achieved using intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). Micromanipulation techniques are used to inject a sperm cell into the cytoplasm of each egg in vitro. Fertilization rates after ICSI are generally $60 \%$ to $70 \%$, or approximately equivalent to conventional insemination in vitro.

## Embryo Transfer

After culturing the cells for 48 to 120 hours, the physician transfers three or four embryos to the uterus at the four- to eight-cell stage (after 2 days) or fewer embryos at the blastocyst stage (after 5 days). Embryos are selected and are loaded into a thin, flexible catheter, which is inserted into the uterine cavity to the desired depth under ultrasonic guidance. The woman usually receives supplemental progesterone to support implantation and pregnancy. In certain cases, the embryos are transferred to the fallopian tube during laparoscopy. This procedure is referred to as tubal embryo transfer (TET). The rationale for this procedure is that the fallopian tube contributes to the early development of the embryo as it travels down the tube to the uterus.

## Success Rates

Implantation rates usually range from $8 \%$ to $15 \%$ per embryo transferred. In the United States, the mean live birth rate per ET procedure is $\sim 33 \%$. Success rates in IVF-ET depend on numerous factors, including age as well as the type and severity of the disease causing infertility.
oscillates about a fulcrum that is situated in the neck region. This rapid, vigorous, rocking action occurs at a frequency of $\sim 6$ to 8 per second. The sperm penetrates the zona pellucida at an angle, which creates a tangential cleavage slit and leaves the sperm head lying sideways against the oocyte membrane.
Step 4: The cell membranes of the sperm and the oocyte fuse. Microvilli on the oocyte surface envelop the sperm cell,
which probably binds to the oocyte membrane via specific proteins on the surfaces of the two cells. The posterior membrane of the acrosome-which remains part of the sperm cell after the acrosomal reaction-is the first portion of the sperm to fuse with the plasma membrane of the egg. The sperm cell per se does not enter the oocyte. Rather, the cytoplasmic portions of the head and tail enter the oocyte, leaving the sperm-cell plasma membrane

behind, an action similar to a snake's crawling out of its skin.
Step 5: The oocyte undergoes the cortical reaction. As the spermatozoon penetrates the oocyte's plasma membrane, it initiates formation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate $\left(\mathrm{IP}_{3}\right)$; $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ causes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from internal stores (see p. 60), which leads to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ waves. This rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{o}$, in turn, triggers the oocyte's second meiotic division-discussed below (see step 6)-and the cortical reaction. In the cortical reaction, small electrondense granules that lie just beneath the plasma membrane fuse with the oocyte's plasma membrane. Exocytosis of these granules releases enzymes that act on glycoproteins in the zona pellucida, causing the zona pellucida to harden. This hardening involves the release of polysaccharides that impede the progression of the
runners-up (i.e., sperm cells still in the zona pellucida). The cortical reaction also leads to the destruction of ZP receptors, which prevents further binding of sperm cells to the zona pellucida. From a teleological perspective, the cortical granule reaction prevents polyspermy. (C) NS6-3 Polyspermic embryos are abnormal because they are polyploid. They do not develop beyond the early cleavage stages.
Step 6: The oocyte completes its second meiotic division. The oocyte, which had been arrested in the prophase of its first meiotic division since fetal life (see p. 1073), completed its first meiotic division at the time of the surge of luteinizing hormone (LH), which occurred several hours before ovulation (see p. 1116). The result was the first polar body and a secondary oocyte with a haploid number of duplicated chromosomes (see Fig. 53-2C). Before fertilization,

# N56-3 Block to Polyspermy 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Unlike the situation in some laboratory animals, in humans the block to polyspermy during fertilization does not involve receptors on the zona pellucida or on the cell membrane. It appears that the block to polyspermy in humans is due only to alterations of the inner aspect of the zona pellucida. In experiments on monospermic oocytes fertilized in vitro, other sperm cells added later can partially penetrate the zona pellucida but do not reach the inner half of the zona. When unfertilized oocytes, monospermic oocytes, and polyspermic oocytes are examined in vitro, similar numbers of sperm are found on and within the zona pellucida of each type of oocyte. Further evidence that the zona pellucida is the primary barrier to polyspermy in humans comes from experiments in which the zona pellucida is removed. In this case, the egg is usually penetrated by many sperm. In the in vitro fertilization of normal human oocytes, the rate of polyspermy is quite low, $\sim 5 \%$ to $8 \%$, even though 50,000 to 300,000 sperm are available to the oocyte. Thus, the zona pellucida block to polyspermy in humans is highly efficient.

this secondary oocyte had begun a second meiotic division, which was arrested in metaphase. The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{++}\right]_{i}$ inside the oocyte-which the sperm cell triggers, as noted in step 5-causes not only the cortical reaction, but also the completion of the oocyte's second meiotic division. One result is the formation of the second polar body, which contains a haploid number of unduplicated maternal chromosomes. (5) N56-4 The oocyte extrudes the chromosomes of the second polar body, together with a small amount of ooplasm, into a space immediately below the zona pellucida; the second polar body usually lies close to the first polar body. The nucleus of the oocyte also contains a haploid number of unduplicated chromosomes. As its chromosomes decondense, the nucleus of this mature ovum becomes the female pronucleus.
Step 7: The sperm nucleus decondenses and transforms into the male pronucleus, which, like the female pronucleus, contains a haploid number of unduplicated chromosomes (see Fig. 54-7). The cytoplasmic portion of the sperm's tail degenerates.
Step 8: The male and female pronuclei fuse, forming a new cell, the zygote. The mingling of chromosomes (syngamy) can be considered as the end of fertilization and the beginning of embryonic development. Thus, fertilization results in a conceptus that bears 46 chromosomes, 23 from the maternal gamete and 23 from the paternal gamete. Fertilization of the ovum by a sperm bearing an X chromosome produces a zygote with XX sex chromosomes; this develops into a female (see pp. 1073-1075). Fertilization with a Y-bearing sperm produces an XY zygote, which develops into a male. Therefore, chromosomal sex is established at fertilization.

## IMPLANTATION OF THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO

As discussed on page 1129, the ovum is fertilized in the ampullary portion of the fallopian tube several hours after ovulation (Fig. 56-2), and the conceptus remains in the fallopian tube for $\sim 72$ hours, during which time it develops to the morula stage (i.e., a mulberry-shaped solid mass of 12 or more cells), receiving nourishment from fallopian-tube secretions. During these 3 days, smooth-muscle contractions of the isthmus prevent advancement of the conceptus into the uterus while the endometrium is preparing for implantation. The mechanisms by which the ovum is later propelled through the isthmus of the fallopian tube to the uterus probably include beating of the cilia of the tubal epithelium and contraction of the fallopian tube.

After the morula rapidly moves through the isthmus to the uterine cavity, it floats freely in the lumen of the uterus and transforms into a blastocyst (see Fig. 56-2). A blastocyst is a ball-like structure with a fluid-filled inner cavity. Surrounding this cavity is a thin layer of trophoectoderm cells that forms the trophoblast, which develops into a variety of supporting structures, including the amnion, the yolk sac, and the fetal portion of the placenta. On one side of the cavity, attached to the trophoblast, is an inner cell mass, which develops into the embryo proper. The conceptus floats freely in the uterine cavity for $\sim 72$ hours before it attaches to the endometrium. Thus, implantation of the human blastocyst normally occurs 6 to 7 days following ovulation. Numerous maturational events occur in the conceptus as it travels to the uterus. The embryo must be prepared to draw nutrients from the endometrium on arrival in the uterine cavity, and the endometrium must be prepared to sustain the

# N56-4 Three Polar Bodies 

## Contributed by Sam Mesiano

Interestingly, although the small polar bodies are nonfunctional, they contain a full set of chromosomes and are responsive to cell cycle-regulatory mechanisms. Consequently, the first polar body also divides during the second meiotic division to produce a total of three polar bodies and a mature oocyte, each of which contain a haploid number of chromosomes. Thus, as with spermatogenesis, one diploid oogonia produces four haploid daughters; however, in oogenesis only one daughter becomes an functional gamete.

implantation of the blastocyst. Because of the specific window in time during which implantation can occur, temporal relationships between embryonic and endometrial maturation assume extreme importance.

## The presence of an embryo leads to decidualization of the endometrium

During the middle to late secretory phase of the normal endometrial cycle, the endometrium becomes more vascularized and thicker, and the endometrial glands become tortuous and engorged with secretions (see pp. 1125-1126). These changes, driven by progesterone from the corpus luteum, peak at $\sim 7$ days after ovulation. Additionally, beginning 9 to 10 days after ovulation, a process known as predecidualization (see pp. 1125-1126) begins near the spiral arteries. During predecidualization, stromal cells transform into rounded decidual cells, and these cells spread across the superficial layer of the endometrium to make it more compact (zona compacta) and separating it from the deeper, more spongy layer (zona spongiosa; see Fig. 55-11). If conception fails to occur, the secretory activity of the endometrial glands decreases, followed by regression of the glands 8 to 9 days after ovulation, which is ultimately followed by menstruation.

When pregnancy occurs, the predecidual changes in the endometrium are sustained and extended, which completes the process of decidualization. The decidua is the specialized endometrium of pregnancy. Its original name was membrana decidua, a term referring to the membranes of the endometrium that are shed following pregnancy, like the leaves of a deciduous tree. Because the degree of decidualization is considerably greater in conception cycles than in nonconception cycles, it is likely that the blastocyst itself promotes decidualization. Indeed, either the presence of the embryo or a traumatic stimulus that mimics the embryo's invasion of the endometrium induces changes in the endometrium. (5) NS6-5

The area underneath the implanting embryo becomes the decidua basalis (Fig. 56-3). Other portions of the decidua that become prominent later in pregnancy are the decidua capsularis, which overlies the embryo, and the decidua parietalis, which covers the remainder of the uterine surface. The upper zona compacta layer and the middle zona spongiosa layer of the nonpregnant endometrium are still recognizable in the decidualized endometrium of pregnancy. The glandular epithelium within the zona spongiosa continues its secretory activity during the first trimester. Some of the glands take on a hypersecretory appearance in what has been referred to as the Arias-Stella phenomenon of early pregnancy-named after the pathologist Javier Arias-Stella. Although the decidualized endometrium is most prominent during the first trimester, prior to the establishment of the definitive placenta, elements of decidualization persist throughout gestation.

## Uterine secretions nourish the preimplantation embryo, promote growth, and prepare it for implantation

Before the embryo implants in the endometrium and establishes an indirect lifeline between the mother's blood and its own, it must receive its nourishment from uterine secretions.

Figure 56-3 Three decidual zones during early embryonic development (about 13 to 14 days postfertilization). The figure shows a sagittal section through a pregnant uterus, with the anterior side to the right.

Following conception, the endometrium is primarily controlled by progesterone, which initially comes from the corpus luteum (see p. 1124). The uterine glandular epithelium synthesizes and secretes several steroid-dependent proteins (Table 56-1) that are thought to be important for the nourishment, growth, and implantation of the embryo. The endometrium secretes cholesterol, steroids, and various nutrients, including iron and fat-soluble vitamins. It also synthesizes matrix substances, adhesion molecules, and surface receptors for matrix proteins, all of which may be important for implantation.

Pinopodes appear as small, finger-like protrusions on endometrial cells between day 19 (about the time the embryo would arrive in the uterus) and day 21 (about the time of implantation) of the menstrual cycle; they persist for only 2 to 3 days. Pinopode formation appears to be progesterone dependent and is inhibited by estrogens. Pinopodes endocytose macromolecules and uterine fluid and absorb most of the fluid in the lumen of the uterus during the early stages of embryo implantation. By removing uterine luminal fluid, the pinopodes may allow the embryo and the uterine epithelium to approximate one another more closely. Because apposition and adhesion of the embryo to the uterus are the first events of implantation, the presence and action of pinopodes may determine the extent of the implantation window.

## The blastocyst secretes substances that facilitate implantation

If the blastocyst is to survive, it must avoid rejection by the maternal cellular immune system. It does so by releasing

One of the earliest signs that the blastocyst has transmitted an embryonic signal to the endometrium is a marked increase in the permeability of endometrial capillaries. One can detect this permeability increase by injecting laboratory rats intravenously with a dye, such as Evans blue, which binds to albumin. Accumulation of blue dye in the area of the blastocyst is an index of increased capillary permeability to albumin. Increased endometrial capillary permeability precedes the decidual response and may be triggered by vasoactive substances released by the blastocyst just prior to implantation. Because inhibitors of histidine decarboxylase (which converts histidine to histamine) interrupt implantation, histamine is one candidate for the vasoactive substance.

Both short-range and long-range embryonic signals may be necessary for implantation, although the nature of some of these signals remains enigmatic. One short-range signal from the blastocyst may stimulate local changes in the endometrium at the time of its apposition to the endometrium. A long-range signal that is secreted by the early blastocyst is human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), which is closely related to LH (see p. 1111) and sustains the corpus luteum in the face of rapidly falling levels of maternal LH.
hCG is one of the most important of the factors secreted by the trophoblast of the blastocyst, both before and after implantation. Besides rescuing the corpus luteum, hCG acts as an autocrine growth factor and promotes trophoblast growth and placental development. hCG levels are high in the area where the trophoblast faces the endometrium. hCG may have a role in the adhesion of the trophoblast to the endometrium and also has protease activity.

## During implantation, the blastocyst apposes itself to the endometrium, adheres to epithelial cells, and finally invades the stroma

this period (i.e., 5 to 6 days after ovulation), the morula transforms into the blastocyst (Fig. 56-4A). Before the initiation of implantation, the zona pellucida that surrounds the blastocyst degenerates. This process, known as hatching of the embryo, occurs 6 to 7 days after ovulation. Lytic factors in the endometrial cavity appear to be essential for the dissolution of the zona pellucida. The blastocyst probably also participates in the process of zona lysis and hatching; when an unfertilized egg is placed in the uterus under the same conditions, its zona pellucida remains intact. A factor produced by the blastocyst may activate a lytic factor that is derived from a uterine precursor. Plasmin, produced from plasminogen, is a plausible candidate for this uterine factor, because plasmin exhibits a lytic effect on the zona pellucida in vitro, and inhibitors of plasmin block in vitro hatching of rat blastocysts. Implantation occurs in three stages: (1) apposition, (2) adhesion, and (3) invasion.

Apposition The earliest contact between the blastocyst wall, the trophoectoderm, and the endometrial epithelium is a loose connection called apposition (see Fig. 56-4B). Apposition usually occurs in a crypt in the endometrium. From the standpoint of the blastocyst, it appears that apposition occurs at a site where the zona pellucida is ruptured or lysed and where it is possible for the cell membranes of the

![bo460346323f](bo460346323f.jpg)

trophoblast to make direct contact with the cell membranes of the endometrium. (5) N56-6 Although the preimplantation blastocyst is asymmetric, it seems that the entire trophoectoderm has the potential to interact with the endometrium, and the final correct orientation-with the inner cell mass pointing toward the endometrium-occurs by free rotation of the inner cell mass within the sphere of overlying trophoectoderm cells.

Adhesion The trophoblast appears to attach to the uterine epithelium via the microvilli of the trophoblast; ligandreceptor interactions are probably involved in adhesion (see Fig. 56-4C). The receptors for these ligand-receptor interactions are often members of the integrin family (see p. 17) and can be either on the blastocyst or on the endometrium. Integrins are bifunctional integral membrane proteins; on their intracellular side, they interact with the cytoskeleton,
whereas on their extracellular side, they have receptors for matrix proteins such as collagen, laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin. Therefore, ligand-receptor interactions have two possible orientations. For the first, the extracellular surface of the trophoblast has integrins for binding fibronectins, laminin, and collagen type IV. Thus, during implantation, the trophoblast binds to the laminin that is distributed around the stromal (decidual) cells of the endometrium. Fibronectin, a component of the basement membrane, probably guides the implanting embryo (see below) and is subsequently broken down by the trophoblast.

For the second orientation of matrix-integrin interactions, the extracellular surface of the glandular epithelium also expresses integrins on days 20 to 24 of the menstrual cycle, the implantation window (see p. 1126). The expression of receptors for fibronectin and vitronectin (i.e., integrins) may serve as markers of the endometrial capacity for

# N56-6 Mechanisms of Apposition 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

A mutual reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between the blastocyst and the endometrial membranes occurs at the time of implantation. The loss of zona pellucida proteins during zona lysis and hatching, as well as changes in glycoproteins and their terminal sugars, may decrease the electrostatic repulsive forces between the conceptus and the endometrium. Inhibitors of protein glycosylation may diminish blastocyst attachment. Further evidence that changes in the zona pellucida are necessary to complete apposition is the fact that neither an unfertilized egg nor the preblastocyst-stage conceptus, each of which is still surrounded by a zona pellucida, shows evidence of adhesion. Changes in the integrity of the cytocalyx lining the surface of the uterine epithelium are also important for apposition.

implantation. Small peptides containing sequences that are homologous to specific sequences of fibronectin block blastocyst attachment and outgrowth on fibronectin.

In addition to the integrin-matrix interactions, another important class of ligand-receptor interactions appears to be between heparin proteoglycans or heparan sulfate proteoglycans (see p. 39), which are attached to the surface of the blastocyst, and surface receptors on the uterine epithelial cell. These endometrial proteoglycan receptors increase in number as the time of implantation approaches.

Any of the foregoing ligand-receptor interactions can lead to cytoskeletal changes. Thus, adhesion of the trophoblast via ligand-receptor interactions may dislodge the uterine epithelial cells from their basal lamina and thereby facilitate access of the trophoblast to the basal lamina for penetration.

Invasion As the blastocyst attaches to the endometrial epithelium, the trophoblastic cells rapidly proliferate, and the trophoblast differentiates into two layers: an inner cytotrophoblast and an outer syncytiotrophoblast (see Fig. 56-4D). The syncytiotrophoblast arises from the fusion of cytotrophoblast cells to form a giant multinucleated cell that constitutes the principal component of the maternal-fetal interface. During implantation, long protrusions from the syncytiotrophoblast extend among the uterine epithelial cells. The protrusions dissociate these endometrial cells by secreting tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF- $\alpha$ ), which interferes with the expression of cadherins (cell-adhesion molecules; see p. 17) and $\beta$ catenin (an intracellular protein that helps anchor cadherins to the cytoskeleton). (5) N56-7 The syncytiotrophoblast protrusions then penetrate the basement membrane of the uterine epithelial cells and ultimately reach the uterine stroma.

The trophoblast secretes several autocrine factors, which appear to stimulate invasion of the endometrial epithelium, as well as proteases (see Table 56-2). By degrading the extracellular matrix, metalloproteases and serine proteases may control both the proliferation and the invasion of the trophoblast into the endometrium.

Around the site of penetration of the syncytiotrophoblast, uterine stromal cells take on a polyhedral shape and become laden with lipids and glycogen. These are the decidual cells discussed above. The degeneration of decidual cells near the invading syncytiotrophoblast thus provides nutrients to the developing embryo. The blastocyst superficially implants in the zona compacta of the endometrium and eventually becomes completely embedded in the decidua. As the fingerlike projections of the syncytiotrophoblast invade the endometrium, they reach the maternal blood supply and represent a primordial form of the chorionic villus of the mature placenta, as discussed in the next subchapter.

The blastocyst is genetically distinct from maternal tissue. Thus, implantation represents a breach of maternal immune defenses that could lead to immune attack and destruction of the embryo. The problem is confounded by the presencewithin the decidual compartment-of uterus-specific large granular lymphocytes also known as decidual natural killer (NK) cells. To avoid attack, cytotrophoblasts that lie at the maternal-fetal interface produce a unique immunogenic molecule, HLA-G, on their cell surface. HLA-G may prevent immunological recognition by activated NK cells. In
addition, trophoblast cells express the Fas ligand (see pp. 1241-1242), which induces apoptosis in immune cells that carry the Fas receptor. Thus, the embryo may escape attack by the maternal immune system by camouflaging itself with HLA-G and by inducing apoptosis in maternal lymphocytes that may mount an attack.

## PHYSIOLOGY OF THE PLACENTA

Eventually, almost all the materials that are necessary for fetal growth and development move from the maternal circulation to the fetal circulation across the placenta, either by passive diffusion or by active transport. Except for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, waste products are largely excreted via the amniotic fluid.

At the placenta, the space between the fetus's chorionic villi and the mother's endometrial wall contains a continuously renewed pool of extravasated maternal blood

Within the syncytium of the invading syncytiotrophoblast, fluid-filled holes called lacunae develop 8 to 9 days after fertilization (Fig. 56-5A). Twelve to 15 days after fertilization, the finger-like projections of the syncytiotrophoblast finally penetrate the endothelial layer of small veins of the endometrium. Later, these projections also penetrate the small spiral arteries. The result is a free communication between the lacunae of the syncytiotrophoblast and the lumina of maternal blood vessels (see Fig. 56-5B). Within 12 to 15 days after fertilization, some cytotrophoblasts proliferate and invade the syncytiotrophoblast to form finger-like projections that are the primary chorionic villi.

With further development, mesenchymal cells from the extraembryonic mesoderm invade the primary chorionic villi, which now are known as secondary chorionic villi. Eventually, these mesenchymal cells form fetal blood vessels de novo, at which point the villi are known as tertiary chorionic villi (see Fig. 56-5C). Continued differentiation and amplification of the surface area of the fetal tissue that is protruding into the maternal blood creates mature chorionic villi. The outer surface of each villus is lined with a very thin layer of syncytiotrophoblast, which has prominent microvilli (brush border) that face the maternal blood. Beneath the syncytiotrophoblast lie cytotrophoblasts, mesenchyme, and fetal blood vessels. The lacunae, filled with maternal blood, eventually merge with one another to create one massive, intercommunicating intervillous space (Fig. 56-6). The fetal villi protruding into this space resemble a thick forest of trees arising from the chorionic plate, which is the analog of the soil from which the trees sprout. Thus, in the mature placenta, fetal blood is separated from maternal blood only by the fetal capillary endothelium, some mesenchyme and cytotrophoblasts, and syncytiotrophoblast.

Maternal Blood Flow The maternal arterial blood is discharged from $\sim 120$ spiral arteries; these arteries may have multiple openings, not all of which need be open at the same time. Blood enters in pulsatile spurts through the wall of the uterus and moves in discrete streams into the intervillous space toward the chorionic plate (see Fig. 56-6). Small lakes

# N56-7 Uterine E-Cadherin and $\beta$-Catenin at the Implantation Site 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The blastocyst can only implant into a receptive endometrium. Conversely, the endometrium can become receptive only when it receives the appropriate signals from the nearby blastocyst, which result in the upregulation of certain genes such as those encoding E-cadherin and $\beta$-catenin.

In the endometrial epithelial cells of the peri-implantation uterus, E-cadherin (see pp. 17 and 44-45)-a transmembrane protein that mediates cell-cell contacts-is expressed at high levels at the apical membrane at the prospective sites of implantation, and much less elsewhere. In addition, $\beta$-catenin (see pp. 44-45 and 50)-a cytoskeletal anchor protein that attaches to the cytosolic domain of the cadheriniis also expressed at the apical membrane of these same cells. These changes are part of the adhesive phenotype of the endometrium during the implantation window.

Figure 56-5 Development of the placenta. A, Shortly after the blastocyst has implanted ( 6 to 7 days after fertilization), the syncytiotrophoblast invades the stroma of the uterus (i.e., the decidua). Within the syncytiotrophoblast are lacunae. B, The invading syncytiotrophoblast breaks through into endometrial veins first, and then later into the arteries, creating direct communication between lacunae and maternal vessels. In addition, the proliferation of cytotrophoblasts creates small mounds known as primary chorionic villi. C, The primary chorionic villus continues to grow with the proliferation of cytotrophoblastic cells. In addition, mesenchyme from the extraembryonic coelom invades the villus, forming the secondary chorionic villus. Eventually, these mesenchymal cells form fetal capillaries; at this time, the villus is known as a tertiary chorionic villus. The lacunae also enlarge by merging with one another.
of blood near the chorionic plate dissipate the force of the arterial spurts and reduce blood velocity. The maternal blood spreads laterally and then reverses direction and cascades over the closely packed villi. Blood flow slows even more, which allows adequate time for exchange. After bathing the chorionic villi, the maternal blood drains through venous orifices in the basal plate, enters the larger maternal placental veins, and ultimately flows into the uterine and other pelvic veins. No capillaries are present between the maternal
arterioles and venules; the intervillous space is the functional capillary. Because the intervillous spaces are very narrow, and the arterial and venous orifices are randomly scattered over the entire base of the placenta, the maternal blood moves efficiently among the chorionic villi and avoids arteriovenous shunts.

The spiral arteries are generally perpendicular, and the veins are generally parallel to the uterine wall. Thus, because of both the geometry of the maternal blood vessels and the difference between maternal arterial and venous pressure, the uterine contractions that occur periodically during pregnancy, as well as during delivery, attenuate arterial inflow and completely interrupt venous drainage. Therefore, the volume of blood in the intervillous space actually increases, providing continual, albeit reduced, exchange. The principal factors that regulate the flow of maternal blood in the intervillous space are maternal arterial blood pressure, intrauterine pressure, and the pattern of uterine contraction.

Fetal Blood Flow The fetal blood originates from two umbilical arteries. Unlike systemic arteries after birth, umbilical arteries carry deoxygenated blood. As these umbilical arteries approach the placenta, they branch repeatedly beneath the amnion, penetrate the chorionic plate, and then branch again within the chorionic villi, forming a capillary network. Blood that has obtained a significantly higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrient content returns to the fetus from the placenta through the single umbilical vein.

The amniotic fluid that fills the amniotic cavity serves two important functions. First, it serves as a mechanical buffer and thus protects the fetus from external physical insults. Second, it serves as a mechanism by which the fetus excretes many waste products. The water in the amniotic fluid turns over at least once a day. After the fetal kidneys mature ( 10 to 12 weeks), the fetus's renal excretions provide $\sim 75 \%$ of amniotic-fluid production, with pulmonary secretions providing the rest. Fluid removal occurs through the actions of the fetal gastrointestinal tract ( 55\%), amnion $(\sim 30 \%)$, and lungs ( $\sim 15 \%)$.

## Gases and other solutes move across the placenta

The placenta is the major lifeline between the mother and the fetus. It provides nutrients and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the fetus, and it removes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and certain waste products from the fetus.
$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Transport The maternal blood coming into the intervillous space has a gas composition similar to that of systemic arterial blood: a partial pressure of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (Table 56-3), a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and a pH of 7.40 . However, the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the maternal blood into the chorionic villi of the fetus causes the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of blood in the intervillous space to fall, so the average $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is 30 to 35 mm Hg . Given the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve of maternal (i.e., adult) hemoglobin (Hb), this $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ translates to an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of $\sim 65 \%$ (see Fig. 29-3). The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of blood in the umbilical vein is even lower. Despite the relatively low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the maternal blood in the intervillous space, the fetus does not suffer from a lack of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Because fetal Hb has a much higher affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than does maternal Hb (see Box 29-1), the fetal Hb can extract $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the maternal Hb . Thus, a

Figure 56-6 Mature placenta. With further development beyond that shown in Figure 56-5C, the outer surface of the mature chorionic villus is covered with a thin layer of syncytiotrophoblast. Under this are cytotrophoblasts, mesenchyme, and fetal blood vessels. The lacunae into which the villi project gradually merge into one massive intervillous space. Maternal blood is trapped in this intervillous space, between the endometrium on the maternal side and the villi on the fetal side. In the mature placenta (shown here), spiral arteries from the mother empty directly into the intervillous space, which is drained by maternal veins. The villi look like a thick forest of trees arising from the chorionic plate, which is the analog of the soil from which the trees sprout.

| SITE | $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}$ | Hb SATURATION (\%) |
| :-- | :--: | :--: |
| Maternal Values |  |  |
| Uterine artery | 100 | 97.5 |
| Intervillous space | $30-35$ | $57-67$ |
| Uterine vein | 30 | 57 |
| Fetal Values |  |  |
| Umbilical arteries | 23 | 60.5 |
| Umbilical vein | 30 | 85.5 |

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 30 to 35 mm Hg , which yields an Hb saturation of $\sim 65 \%$ in the intervillous space in the mother's blood, produces an Hb saturation of $\sim 85 \%$ in the umbilical vein of the fetus (see Table 56-3), assuming that the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ fully equilibrates between intervillous and fetal blood. Other mechanisms of ensuring adequate fetal oxygenation include the relatively high cardiac output per unit body weight of the fetus and the increasing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-carrying capacity of fetal blood late in pregnancy as the Hb concentration rises to a level $50 \%$ higher than that of the adult.

The transfer of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the fetus to the mother is driven by a concentration gradient between the blood in the umbilical arteries and that in the intervillous space. Near the end of pregnancy, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the umbilical arteries is $\sim 48 \mathrm{~mm}$ Hg , and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the intervillous space is $\sim 43 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, a gradient of $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The fetal blood also has a somewhat lower affinity for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ than does maternal blood, which favors the transfer of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the fetus to mother.

Other Solutes Solutes besides $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ move across the placenta between the mother and the fetus, availing themselves of numerous transport mechanisms. Some of these solutes, such as the waste products urea and creatinine, probably move passively from fetus to mother. The lipidsoluble steroid hormones shuttle among the mother, the placenta, and the fetus, perhaps by simple diffusion. Glucose moves from the mother to the fetus by facilitated diffusion (see p. 114), and amino acids move by secondary active transport (see p. 115). The placenta also transports several other essential substances, such as vitamins and minerals, that are needed for fetal growth and development. Many substances are present in the fetal circulation at concentrations higher than in the maternal blood, and they must be actively transported against concentration or electrochemical gradients. The necessary energy (i.e., ATP) is derived from glycolysis and the citric acid cycle, for which the enzymes are present in the human placenta at term. Also present are the enzymes for the pentose phosphate pathway, an alternative pathway for the oxidation of glucose, which provides the reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) necessary for several synthetic pathways that require reducing equivalents in the human placenta at term. (5) NS8-5

The placenta takes up large molecules from the mother through receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42). The uptake of substances such as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), transferrin, hormones (e.g., insulin), and antibodies (e.g., immunoglobulin G) increases throughout gestation until just before birth.

## The placenta makes a variety of peptide hormones, including hCG and human chorionic somatomammotropin

The placenta plays a key role in steroid synthesis, as discussed in the next subchapter. In addition, the placenta manufactures numerous amines, polypeptides (including peptide hormones and neuropeptides), proteins, glycoproteins, and steroids (Table 56-4). Among these peptides are the placental variants of all known hypothalamic releasing hormones (see Table 47-2). These placental releasing hormones may act in a paracrine fashion, controlling the release of local placental hormones, or they may enter the maternal or fetal circulations. In addition, several proteases are also present in the placenta. Although the placenta synthesizes a wide variety of substances, the significance of many of these substances is not clear.

The most important placental peptide hormone is hCG. In the developing blastocyst, and later in the mature placenta, the syncytiotrophoblast cells synthesize hCG, perhaps under the direction of progesterone and estrogens. The placenta also produces two human chorionic somatomammotropins, hCS1 and hCS2, also called human placental lactogens (hPL1, hPL2). hCS1 and hCS2 are polypeptide hormones structurally related to growth hormone (GH) and placental-variant growth hormone (pvGH), as well as to prolactin (PRL; see Table 48-1). They play a role in the conversion of glucose to fatty acids and ketones, and thus coordinate the fuel economy of the fetoplacental unit. The fetus and placenta use fatty acids and ketones as energy sources and store them as fuels in preparation for the early neonatal period, when a considerable reservoir of energy is necessary for the transition from intrauterine life to life outside the uterus. hCS1 and hCS2 also promote the development of maternal mammary glands during pregnancy.

In addition to secreting various substances, the placenta also stores vast amounts of proteins, polypeptides, glycogen, and iron. Many of these stored substances can be used at times of poor maternal nutrition and also during the transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life.

## THE MATERNAL-PLACENTAL-FETAL UNIT

## During pregnancy, progesterone and estrogens rise to levels that are substantially higher than their peaks in a normal cycle

Following ovulation during a normal or nonconception cycle, the cells of the ovarian follicle functionally transform into luteal cells, which produce mainly progesterone but also estrogens (see pp. 1116-1117). However, the corpus luteum has a life span of only $\sim 12$ days before it begins its demise in the face of declining LH levels. As a consequence of luteal demise, levels of both progesterone and estrogens decline.

In contrast, during pregnancy, maternal levels of progesterone and estrogens (estradiol, estrone, estriol) all increase, reaching levels substantially higher than those achieved during a normal menstrual cycle (Fig. 56-7). These elevated levels are necessary for maintaining pregnancy. For example, progesterone-the progestational hormone-reduces uterine motility and inhibits propagation of contractions. How are these elevated levels of female steroids achieved? Early in the first trimester, hCG that is manufactured by the syncytiotrophoblast rescues the corpus luteum, which is the major

The progesterone spikes near -8 and -4 weeks refer to the two menstrual cycles before the one that resulted in the pregnancy. Estriol, produced from fetal adrenal androgens, increases only after 8 to 10 weeks, when fetal adrenal androgen production increases exponentially.

source of progesterone and estrogens. This function of the corpus luteum in the ovary continues well into early pregnancy. However, by itself, the corpus luteum is not adequate to generate the very high steroid levels that are characteristic of late pregnancy. The developing placenta itself augments its production of progesterone and estrogens, so by 8 weeks of gestation the placenta has become the major source of these steroids-the luteal-placental shift. Removal of the ovaries (with the corpus luteum) before the luteal-placental shift leads to miscarriage, whereas pregnancy continues normally if the ovaries are removed after the luteal-placental shift. The placenta continues to produce large quantities of estrogens, progestins, and other hormones throughout gestation.

Estriol, which is not important in nonpregnant women, is a major estrogen-based on circulating levels-during pregnancy (see Fig. 56-7). 056-1

## After 8 weeks of gestation, the maternal-placental-fetal unit maintains high levels of progesterone and estrogens

Although it emerges as the major source of progesterone and estrogens (Table 56-5), the human placenta cannot synthesize these hormones by itself; it requires the assistance of both mother and fetus. This joint effort in steroid biosynthesis has led to the concept of the maternal-placental-fetal unit. Figure 56-8-which resembles the maps describing the synthesis of glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids (see Fig. 50-2), male steroids (see Fig. 54-6), and female steroids (see Fig. 55-8)-illustrates the pathways that the maternal-placental-fetal unit uses to synthesize progesterone and the estrogens. Figure 56-9 summarizes the exchange of synthetic intermediates among the three members of the maternal-placental-fetal unit.

Unlike the corpus luteum, which manufactures progesterone, estrone, and estradiol early in pregnancy (see p. 1116), the placenta is an imperfect endocrine organ. First, the placenta cannot manufacture adequate cholesterol, the precursor for steroid synthesis. Second, the placenta lacks two crucial enzymes that are needed for synthesizing estrone and
estradiol. Third, the placenta lacks a third enzyme that is needed to synthesize estriol. The enzymes missing from the placenta are listed in Table 56-5, and they also are indicated with a brown background in Figures 56-8 and 56-9.

The maternal-placental-fetal unit overcomes these placental shortcomings in two ways. First, the mother supplies most of the cholesterol as LDL particles (see p. 968). With this supply of maternal cholesterol, the placenta can generate large amounts of progesterone and export it to the mother, which solves the problem of maintaining maternal progesterone levels after the corpus luteum becomes inadequate. Second, the fetal adrenal gland and liver supply the three enzymes that the placenta lacks. The fetal adrenal glands are up to this metabolic task; at term, these glands are as large as those of an adult.

The fetus does not synthesize estrogens without assistance, for two reasons. First, it cannot, because the fetus lacks the enzymes that catalyze the last two steps in the production of estrone, the precursor of estradiol. These two enzymes are also necessary to synthesize estriol. The enzymes missing from the fetus are listed in Table 56-5, and they also are indicated with a blue background in Figures 56-8 and 56-9. Second, the fetus should not synthesize estrogens without assistance. If the fetus were to carry out the complete classic biosynthesis of progesterone and the estrogens, it would expose itself to dangerously high levels of hormones that are needed not by the fetus but by the mother.

The fetus and its placenta use three strategies to extricate themselves from this conundrum. First, because the fetus lacks the two enzymes noted above, it never makes anything beyond dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and $16 \alpha$-hydroxyDHEA (see Fig. 56-8). In particular, the fetus cannot make progesterone or any of the three key estrogens. Second, the placenta is a massive sink for the weak androgens that the fetus does synthesize, which prevents the masculinization of female fetuses. Third, the fetus conjugates the necessary steroid intermediates to sulfate, which greatly reduces their biological activity (see Fig. 56-9). Thus, as pregnenolone moves from the placenta to the fetus, it is sulfated. The products of fetal pregnenolone metabolism are also sulfated (DHEAS and $16 \alpha$-hydroxy-DHEAS) as long as they reside

Because $16 \alpha$-hydroxylase is expressed only by the fetal liver, the level of estriol in the maternal circulation during pregnancy reflects the activity of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

inside the fetus. It is only when DHEAS and $16 \alpha$-hydroxyDHEAS finally move to the placenta that a sulfatase removes the sulfate groups, and thus the placenta can complete the process of steroidogenesis and can export the hormones to the mother.

## RESPONSE OF THE MOTHER TO PREGNANCY

The mean duration of human pregnancy is $\sim 266$ days ( 38 weeks) from the time of ovulation or 280 days ( 40 weeks) from the first day of the last menstrual period. During this time, the mother experiences numerous and profound adaptive changes in her cardiovascular system, fluid volume, respiration, fuel metabolism, and nutrition. These orderly changes reflect the effects of various hormones as well as the increase in the size of the pregnant uterus.

## Both maternal cardiac output and blood volume increase during pregnancy

The maternal blood volume starts to increase during the first trimester, expands rapidly during the second trimester, rises at a much lower rate during the third trimester, and finally achieves a plateau during the last several weeks of pregnancy. Maternal blood volume may have increased by as much as $45 \%$ near term in singleton pregnancies and up to $75 \%$ to
$100 \%$ in twin or triplet pregnancies. The increase in blood volume is due to an increase in the volume of both the plasma and erythrocytes. However, the rise in plasma volume begins earlier and is ultimately greater ( $\sim 50 \%$ ) than the rise in total erythrocyte volume ( $\sim 33 \%$ ). A proposed mechanism for the increase in plasma volume is that elevated progesterone and estrogens cause a vasodilation that decreases peripheral vascular resistance and thus renal perfusion. One mechanism of the vasodilation is refractoriness to the pressor effects of angiotensin II. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis responds by increasing aldosterone (see pp. 841-842), which augments renal reabsorption of salt and water. In addition, pregnancy causes a leftward shift of the relationship between arginine vasopressin (AVP) release and plasma osmolality (see Fig. 40-7). Immediately after the delivery of the placenta, with the attendant decreases in progesterone and estrogen levels, the mother commences a vigorous diuresis.

The increase in blood volume is needed to meet the demands of the enlarged pregnant uterus with its greatly hypertrophied vascular system. It also protects mother and fetus against the deleterious effects of impaired venous return in the supine and erect positions, and it safeguards the mother against the adverse effects of the blood loss associated with parturition.

Cardiac output increases appreciably during the first trimester of pregnancy (by $35 \%$ to $40 \%$ ), but increases only slightly during the second and third trimesters ( $\sim 45 \%$ at

term). The increase in cardiac output, which reflects mainly an increase in stroke volume but also in heart rate, is highly targeted. Renal blood flow increases $40 \%$. Uterine blood flow rises from just $1 \%$ to $15 \%$ of cardiac output. Blood flow to the heart (to support increased cardiac output), skin (to increase heat radiation), and breasts (to support mammary development) also increases. However, no change occurs in blood flow to the brain, gut, or skeleton. The increase in cardiac output with physical activity is greater in pregnant women (for most of the pregnancy) than it is in nonpregnant women.

Despite the large increase in plasma volume, mean arterial pressure (MAP) usually decreases during midpregnancy and then rises during the third trimester, although it normally remains at or lower than normal. The reason for this initial fall in MAP is a decrease in peripheral vascular resistance, possibly reflecting-in part-the aforementioned vasodilating effects of progesterone and estradiol.

Posture has a major effect on cardiac output (see pp. 575-576). In late pregnancy, cardiac output is typically higher when the mother is in the lateral recumbent position than when she is in the supine position. In the supine position, the fundus of the enlarged uterus rests on the inferior vena cava near L5, thereby impeding venous return to the heart.

## Increased levels of progesterone during pregnancy increase alveolar ventilation

During pregnancy, hormonal and mechanical factors lead to several anatomical changes that have the net effect of increasing alveolar ventilation. The level of the diaphragm rises $\sim 4 \mathrm{~cm}$, which probably reflects the relaxing effects of progesterone on the diaphragm muscle and fascia. At the same time, the costovertebral angle widens appreciably as the transverse diameter of the thoracic cage increases $\sim 2 \mathrm{~cm}$. Although these two changes have opposite effects on the residual volume (RV) of air in the lungs (see p. 602), the elevation of the diaphragm dominates, which causes a net decrease in RV and functional residual capacity (FRC). Vital capacity (VC), maximal pulmonary ventilation, and pulmonary compliance do not change appreciably. Total pulmonary resistance falls, which facilitates airflow. Because of the increased size of the abdominal contents during pregnancy, the abdominal muscles are less effective in aiding forced expirations.

Although pregnancy has little effect on respiratory rate, it increases tidal volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$ markedly-by $\sim 40 \%$-and thereby increases alveolar ventilation ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$; see pp. 675676). These increases in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ are some of the earliest physiological changes during pregnancy, beginning 6 weeks after fertilization. They may reflect, at least in part, a direct stimulatory effect of progesterone and, to a lesser extent, estrogen on the medullary respiratory centers. The physiological effect of the increased $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ during pregnancy is a fall in maternal arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, which typically decreases from $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ before pregnancy to $\sim 32 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, despite the net increase in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production that reflects fetal metabolism. A side effect is mild respiratory alkalosis for which the kidneys compensate by lowering plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$modestly (see p. 641).

## Pregnancy increases the demand for dietary protein, iron, and folic acid

During pregnancy, an additional 30 g of protein will be needed each day to meet the demand of the growing fetus, placenta, uterus, and breasts, as well as the increased maternal blood volume. Most protein should come from animal sources, such as meat, milk, eggs, cheese, poultry, and fish, because these foods furnish amino acids in optimal combinations.

Almost any diet that includes iodized salt and adequate caloric intake to support the pregnancy also contains enough minerals, except iron (see Table 45-4). Pregnancy necessitates a net gain of $\sim 800 \mathrm{mg}$ of circulating iron to support the expanding maternal Hb mass, the placenta, and the fetus. Most of this iron is used during the latter half of pregnancy. A nonpregnant woman of reproductive age needs to absorb $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{mg} /$ day of iron in a diet that contains 15 to $20 \mathrm{mg} /$ day (see p. 939). In contrast, during pregnancy, the average required iron uptake rises to $\sim 7 \mathrm{mg} /$ day. Very few women have adequate iron stores to supply this amount of iron, and a typical diet seldom contains sufficient iron. Thus, the recommended supplementation of elemental iron is $60 \mathrm{mg} /$ day, taken in the form of a simple ferrous iron salt.

Maternal folate requirements increase significantly during pregnancy, in part reflecting an increased demand for producing blood cells. This increased demand can lead to lowered plasma folate levels or, in extreme cases, to maternal megaloblastic anemia (see pp. 933-935). Folate deficiency may cause neural tube defects in the developing fetus. Because oral supplementation of 400 to $800 \mu \mathrm{~g} /$ day of folic acid produces a vigorous hematological response in pregnant women with severe megaloblastic anemia, this dosage would almost certainly provide very effective prophylaxis.

## Less than one third of the total maternal weight gain during pregnancy represents the fetus

The recommended weight gain during a singleton pregnancy for a woman with a normal ratio of weight to height (i.e., body mass index) is 11.5 to 16 kg . This number is higher for women with a low body mass index. A weight gain of 14 kg would include 5 kg for intrauterine contents-the fetus $(3.3 \mathrm{~kg})$, placenta and membranes $(0.7 \mathrm{~kg})$, and amniotic fluid ( 1 kg ). The maternal contribution of 9 kg would include increases in the weight of the uterus $(0.7 \mathrm{~kg})$, (1) N56-8 the blood ( 1.3 kg ), and the breasts ( 2.0 kg ), as well as adipose tissue and interstitial fluid ( 5.0 kg ). The interstitial fluid expansion may be partly the result of increased venous pressure created by the large pregnant uterus and, as noted above, partly caused by aldosterone-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$retention (see p. 1142).

For a woman whose weight is normal before pregnancy, a weight gain in the recommended range correlates well with a favorable outcome of the pregnancy. Most pregnant women can achieve an adequate weight gain by eating-according to appetite-a diet adequate in calories, protein, minerals, and vitamins. Seldom, if ever, should maternal weight gain be deliberately restricted to less than this level. Failure to gain weight is an ominous sign; birth weight parallels maternal

weight, and neonatal mortality rises with low birth weight, particularly for babies weighing $<2500 \mathrm{~g}$.

## PARTURITION

## Human birth usually occurs at around the 40th week of gestation

As we will see in Chapter 57, after birth, the fetus-now a neonate-must maintain physiological homeostasis even though it has lost its placenta and been thrust into a markedly altered environment. Therefore, birth should occur only after organ systems have matured sufficiently to allow the neonate to survive outside the uterus. At the $\sim 40$ th week of gestation, critical organ systems, especially those that interface with the environment (e.g., lungs, gut, and immune system) and those that maintain homeostasis (e.g., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, kidneys, liver, and pancreas), are functionally competent, and with maternal nurturing, the neonate has a high probability of survival. However, birth prior to 40 weeks is associated with neonatal morbidity and mortality, the severity of which increases the earlier birth occurs.

Parturition-the process of birth-is an integral and pivotal event in the reproductive cycle of all viviparous species. The process involves (1) transformation of the myometrium (smooth-muscle component of the uterine wall) from a quiescent to a highly contractile state to become the engine for birth, (2) remodeling of the uterine cervix such that it softens (effacement) and dilates to open the gateway for birth, (3) rupture of the fetal membranes, (4) expulsion of the uterine contents, and (5) return of the uterus to its prepregnant state.

## Parturition occurs in distinct stages, numbered 0 to 3

Stage 0-Quiescence Throughout most of pregnancy the uterus is relaxed, quiescent, and relatively insensitive to uterotonins-hormones that stimulate contractions, such as prostaglandins (PGs) and oxytocin (OT)—and the uterine cervix remains closed and rigid. The quiescent uterus grows and distends to accommodate the developing conceptus (fetus, placenta, and amniotic fluid), and myometrial cells undergo significant hypertrophy. Weak and irregular contractions, known as Braxton Hicks contractions, occur toward the end of pregnancy and may increase in frequency and intensity near term. These contractions are not powerful enough to induce labor, however, and are thought to prepare the uterus for parturition.

Stage 1-Transformation/Activation Before labor, the myometrium transforms to a more contractile state. This awakening of myometrial cells involves increased expression of genes that encode factors collectively referred to as contraction-associated proteins (CAPs). Some important CAPs are receptors for uterotonic hormones (e.g., prostaglandin $\mathrm{F}_{2}\left[\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}\right]$ receptor and OT receptor), enzymes involved in PG synthesis (e.g., cyclooxygenase 2), and components of gap junction complexes (e.g., connexin-43). Gap junctions are especially important because they form electrochemical connections between myometrial cells to
synchronize contractions over the entire uterus (see pp. 243-244). The cervix also begins to express genes encoding enzymes that break down the collagen matrix to facilitate effacement and dilation.

Stage 2-Active Labor Three major factors induce the forceful and rhythmic contractions that, in association with effacement and dilation of the cervix, constitute the obstetrical definition of labor: (1) increased levels of PGs (especially $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ ) produced by the myometrium and fetal membranes, (2) increased myometrial cell interconnectivity, and (3) increased myometrial responsiveness to PGs and OT. Each contraction forces the fetal head against the cervix, which becomes progressively more compliant as its extracellular matrix remodels. Eventually, the cervix dilates enough to allow the contractions of labor to force the fetus and then the placenta through the birth canal. Labor may last for several hours, a day, or even longer and eventually results in the expulsion of the fetus, placenta, and membranes through the vaginal canal.

Stage 3-Involution Immediately after expulsion of the uterine contents, it is mainly OT that causes the sustained and forceful myometrial contraction that helps constrict the spiral arterioles and thereby facilitates postpartum uterine hemostasis. This contraction is critical to avoid a potentially lethal postpartum hemorrhage through the vascular lakes once occupied by the placental villi. The maternal endocrine milieu changes dramatically after birth. Estrogens produced by the placenta during pregnancy are uterotrophic; that is, they stimulate growth of the uterus, (1) N56-II primarily hypertrophy of the myometrium. Estrogens also increase the vascularity of the uterus. The decline in estrogen levels after birth causes myometrial atrophy. As the organ reverts to its nonpregnant size during the first 3 to 6 weeks after birth, uterine vasculature regresses, which curtails blood flow and leads to further involution. At the same time, the cervix remodels and reverts to the closed and rigid state. Within 3 to 5 months, the endometrium re-establishes cyclic activity as the menstrual cycle resumes.

## Reciprocal decreases in progesterone receptors and increases in estrogen receptors are critical for the onset of labor

Although not all of the factors leading to the initiation of labor are known, endocrine and paracrine interactions, signals elicited in response to inflammation (e.g., in response to intrauterine infection), and mechanical stretching of the uterus appear to play key roles. Once labor is initiated, it is sustained by a series of positive-feedback mechanisms involving inflammation within the gestational tissuesmyometrium, cervix, decidua, placenta, nonplacental chorion, and amnion-until the uterine contents are expelled.

The principal hormones that affect parturition are progesterone and estrogens (a mix of estradiol, estrone, and estriol).

Progesterone promotes pregnancy mainly by inducing myometrial relaxation and blocking the contractions of labor. Treatment of women with nuclear progesterone receptor antagonists, such as mifepristone (RU486), increases

myometrial contractility and excitability and in most cases induces labor at any stage of pregnancy.

Estrogens augment myometrial contractility and thus cervical dilation. They are thought to oppose the actions of progesterone by increasing the responsiveness of myometrial cells to OT and PGs and by stimulating the formation of gap junctions between myometrial cells. Estrogens also increase the production and release of PGs by the fetal membranes, and in the cervix, estrogens stimulate expression of proteolytic enzymes (e.g., collagenase), which degrade the extracellular matrix to facilitate effacement and dilation.

In most viviparous species, the onset of labor is triggered by a coordinated decrease in circulating progesterone levels (progesterone withdrawal) and an increase in circulating estrogen levels (estrogen activation). In women, however, uterine cells are exposed to high levels of progesterone and estrogens for most of pregnancy, and progesterone level remains elevated during labor and delivery, declining only when the placenta is expelled. Thus, human parturition is not associated with systemic progesterone withdrawal. Instead, labor in women is thought to be initiated by desensitization of uterine cells to the progestational actions of progesterone (i.e., functional progesterone withdrawal). Because progesterone inhibits estrogen receptor expression, the functional desensitization to progesterone leads to increased expression of estrogen receptors. The result is an increased responsiveness to circulating estrogens, which induces genes encoding CAPs that augment contractility and transform the myometrium from a quiescent to a laboring phenotype. The shift from progesterone to estrogen dominance is thought to be the pivotal trigger event for human parturition and is mediated by reciprocal changes in progesterone and estrogen receptor levels in myometrial and cervical cells.

## Signals from the fetus may initiate labor

Studies in sheep demonstrate the importance of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the preparation for, or initiation of, parturition. In the fetal lamb, transection of the hypothalamic portal vessels-or removal of the fetal pituitary—prolongs gestation. Infusing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; see pp. 1023-1025) into fetal lambs with intact adrenal glands, or directly infusing cortisol into the fetus, causes premature maturation of fetal organ systems (especially the lungs) and premature parturition. Indeed, a surge in fetal adrenal cortisol production triggers normal parturition in sheep. Cortisol, in turn, induces the expression of placental enzymes that convert progesterone to estrogens (see Fig. 56-9), triggering a shift from progesterone to estrogen dominance and thereby inducing labor and delivery. (5) N56-9 In humans, the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis does not play as critical a role in controlling the timing of birth. In fact, the maternal and fetal/ placental signals that initiate labor in women are not clearly understood.

## PGs initiate uterine contractions, and both PGs and OT sustain labor

Whereas OT, produced by the maternal posterior pituitary, and PGs, produced locally within the gestational tissues, play
an important role in stimulating the contractions that sustain labor, only PGs are believed to have a key role in initiating labor.

Prostaglandins The uterus, the placenta, and the fetal membranes synthesize and release PGs (see p. 64). Arachidonic acid, the precursor of PG production, is present in very high concentrations in the fetal membranes near term. $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ from the uterine decidual cells act by a paracrine mechanism on adjacent myometrial cells. OT stimulates uterine decidual cells to increase $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ synthesis. Thus, PGs and OT act synergistically to augment uterine contractility.

PGs have three major effects. First, PGs strongly stimulate myometrial contraction. Second, $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ potentiates OTinduced contractions by promoting formation of gap junctions (see pp. 158-159) between uterine smooth-muscle cells. Third, PGs also cause effacement of the cervix, which occurs early during labor. This softening is akin to an inflammatory reaction in that it is associated with an invasion by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (see p. 435). Because of these effects, PGs are used to induce labor and delivery in certain clinical settings.

PGs may physiologically initiate labor. Both $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ evoke myometrial contractions at any stage of gestation, regardless of the route of administration. The levels of PGs or their metabolic products naturally increase in the blood and amniotic fluid just before and during labor. Arachidonic acid instilled into the amniotic cavity causes the uterus to contract and to expel its contents. Aspirin, which inhibits the enzyme cyclooxygenases (see pp. 62-64), reduces the formation of $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ and $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, thus inhibiting labor and prolonging gestation.

Oxytocin The nonapeptide OT is closely related to AVP (Fig. 56-10), (5) N56-10 and both are synthesized in the cell bodies of the neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus of the fetus and mother. Both OT and AVP then move by fast axonal transport to the posterior pituitary gland, where they are stored in the nerve terminals until released-along with neurophysins (see pp. 845 and 981)—in response to the appropriate stimuli.

## N56-9 Fetal Hypothalamic-PituitaryAdrenal Axis near the End of Pregnancy in Sheep

## Contributed by Sam Mesiano

In sheep, the timing of birth is determined by the activity of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which not only triggers labor but also stimulates the functional maturation of key fetal organ systems, so that the fetus is prepared for life as a neonate. These studies in sheep led directly to the development of synthetic glucocorticoid therapy to promote fetal lung maturation in women experiencing preterm labor and threatened preterm birth.

## N56-10 Vasotocin, Oxytocin, and Arginine Vasopressin

Contributed by Ervin Jones
OT and AVP apparently evolved from vasotocin, the single neurohypophyseal hormone in nonmammalian vertebrates. OT and AVP, which both differ from vasotocin by a single amino acid, are synthesized in the cell bodies of the neurons in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus.

Circulating OT binds to $\mathrm{G} \alpha_{q}$-coupled OT receptors (OTRs) on the plasma membrane of myometrial cells, triggering the phospholipase C cascade (see p. 58). Presumably, formation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ leads to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from internal stores and to an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. The rise in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ activates calmodulin, which stimulates myosin light-chain kinase to phosphorylate the regulatory light chain; the result is contraction of uterine smooth muscle (see pp. 247-248) and increased intrauterine pressure. OT also binds to a receptor on decidual cells, thereby stimulating $\mathrm{PGF}_{2 \alpha}$ production, as discussed above.

Estrogen increases the number of OTRs in the myometrium and decidua during pregnancy. The uterus actually remains insensitive to OT until $\sim 20$ weeks' gestation, at which time the number of OTRs increases progressively to 80 -fold higher than baseline values by $\sim 36$ weeks, plateaus just before labor, and then rises again to 200 -fold higher than baseline values during early labor. The time course of the expression of OTRs may account for the increase in spontaneous myometrial contractions even in the absence of increased plasma OT levels. Whereas the uterus is sensitive to OT only at the end of pregnancy, it is susceptible to PGs throughout pregnancy.

Maternal plasma OT levels rise gradually during the 40 weeks of pregnancy and then rise further with active labor (stage 2), with maternal OT being released in bursts and the frequency of these bursts increasing as labor progresses. The primary stimulus for the release of maternal OT appears to be distention of the cervix; this effect is known as the Ferguson reflex. OT is an important stimulator of myometrial contraction late in labor. During the second stage of labor, OT release may play a synergistic role in the expulsion of the fetus by virtue of its ability to stimulate PG release.

During the third stage of labor, uterine contractions induced by OT are also important for constricting uterine blood vessels at the site where the placenta used to be, which promotes hemostasis (i.e., blood coagulation). At about 60 minutes after delivery, maternal plasma OT levels return to prepartum levels.

Relaxin Relaxin is a polypeptide hormone of 48 amino acids, structurally related to insulin, that is produced by the corpus luteum, the placenta, and the decidua. Relaxin may play a role in keeping the uterus in a quiet state during pregnancy. Production and release of relaxin increase during labor, when relaxin may soften and thus help dilate the cervix.

Mechanical Factors Mechanical stretch placed on the uterine muscle may lead to the rhythmic contractions of labor. Thus, the increase in the size of the uterine contents to a critical level may stimulate uterine contractions and thereby lead to initiation of labor.

Positive Feedback Once labor is initiated, several positivefeedback loops involving PGs and OT help to sustain it. First, uterine contractions stimulate PG release, which itself increases the intensity of uterine contractions. Second, uterine activity stretches the cervix, which stimulates OT release via the Ferguson reflex. Because OT stimulates further uterine contractions, these contractions become self-perpetuating.

## LACTATION

The fundamental secretory unit of the breast (Fig. 56-11A) is the alveolus (see Fig. 56-11B, C), which is surrounded by contractile myoepithelial cells and adipose cells. These alveoli are organized into secretory lobules, each of which drains into a ductule. A group of 15 to 20 ductules drain into a lactiferous duct, which widens at the ampulla-a small reservoir. The lactiferous ducts carry the secretions to the outside.

Breast development at puberty depends on several hormones, but primarily on the estrogens and progesterone. During pregnancy, gradual increases in levels of PRL and hCS, as well as very high levels of estrogens and progesterone, lead to full development of the breasts.

As indicated in Table 56-6, hormones affecting the breast are mammogenic (promoting the proliferation of alveolar and duct cells), lactogenic (promoting initiation of milk production by alveolar cells), galactokinetic (promoting contraction of myoepithelial cells and thus milk ejection), or galactopoietic (maintaining milk production after it has been established).

## The epithelial alveolar cells of the mammary gland secrete the complex mixture of sugars, proteins, lipids, and other substances that constitute milk

Milk is an emulsion of fats in an aqueous solution containing sugar (lactose), proteins (lactalbumin and casein), and several cations $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right.$, and $\left.\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$and anions $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right.$and phosphate). The composition of human milk differs from that of human colostrum (the thin, yellowish, milk-like substance secreted during the first several days after parturition) and cow's milk (Table 56-7). Cow's milk has more than three times more protein than human milk, almost exclusively a result of its much higher casein concentration. It also has a higher electrolyte content. The difference in composition between human milk and cow's milk is important because a newborn, with his or her delicate gastrointestinal tract, may not tolerate the more concentrated cow's milk.

The epithelial cells in the alveoli of the mammary gland secrete the complex mixture of constituents that make up milk by five major routes (see Fig. 56-11D).

Figure 56-11 Cross section of the breast and milk production. A, The breast consists of a series of secretory lobules, which empty into ductules. The ductules from 15 to 20 lobules combine into a duct, which widens at the ampulla-a small reservoir. The lactiferous duct carries the secretions to the outside. B, The lobule is made up of many alveoli, the fundamental secretory units. C, Each alveolus consists of secretory epithelial cells (alveolar cells) that actually secrete the milk, as well as contractile myoepithelial cells, which are in turn surrounded by adipose cells. D, The epithelial alveolar cell secretes the components of milk via five pathways.

1. Secretory pathway. The milk proteins lactalbumin and casein are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and sorted to the Golgi apparatus (see p. 21). Here alveolar cells add $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and phosphate to the lumen. Lactose synthetase in the lumen of the Golgi catalyzes synthesis of lactose, the major carbohydrate. Lactose synthetase has two components, a galactosyltransferase and lactalbumin, both made in the endoplasmic reticulum. Water enters the secretory vesicle by osmosis. Finally, exocytosis

discharges the contents of the vesicle into the lumen of the alveolus.
2. Transcellular endocytosis and exocytosis. The basolateral membrane takes up maternal immunoglobulins by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42). Following transcellular transport of these vesicles to the apical membrane, the cell secretes these immunoglobulins (primarily immunoglobulin A) by exocytosis. The gastrointestinal tract of the infant takes up these immunoglobulins (see p. 922), which are important for conferring immunity before the infant's own immune system matures.
3. Lipid pathway. Epithelial cells synthesize short-chain fatty acids. However, the longer-chain fatty acids ( $>16$ carbons) that predominate in milk originate primarily from the diet or from fat stores. The fatty acids form into lipid droplets and move to the apical membrane. As the apical membrane surrounds the droplets and pinches off, it secretes the milk lipids into the lumen in a membranebound sac.
4. Transcellular salt and water transport. Various transport processes at the apical and basolateral membranes move small electrolytes from the interstitial fluid into the lumen of the alveolus. Water follows an osmotic gradient generated primarily by lactose (present at a final concentration of $\sim 200 \mathrm{mM}$ ) and, to a lesser extent, by the electrolytes.
5. Paracellular pathway. Salt and water can also move into the lumen of the alveolus via the tight junctions (see p. 137). In addition, cells, primarily leukocytes, also squeeze between cells and enter the milk.

## PRL is essential for milk production, and suckling is a powerful stimulus for PRL secretion

PRL is a polypeptide hormone that is structurally related to GH, pvGH, and hCS1 and hCS2 (see Table 48-1). Like GH, PRL is made and released in the anterior pituitary; however, lactotrophs rather than somatotrophs are responsible for PRL synthesis. Another difference is that, whereas GH-releasing hormone stimulates somatotrophs to release GH, dopamine (DA) inhibits the release of PRL from lactotrophs. Thus, the removal of inhibition promotes PRL release. The actions of PRL on the mammary glands (see Table 56-6) include promotion of mammary growth (mammogenic effect), initiation of milk secretion (lactogenic effect),

TABLE 56-7 Composition of Human Colostrum, Human Milk, and Cow's Milk (per Deciliter of Fluid)

| COMPONENT | HUMAN COLUSTRIUM | HUMAN MILK | COW'S MILK |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Total protein ( g ) | 2.7 | 0.9 | 3.3 |
| Casein (\% of total protein) | 44 | 44 | 82 |
| Total fat ( g ) | 2.9 | 4.5 | 3.7 |
| Lactose ( g ) | 5.7 | 7.1 | 4.8 |

and maintenance of milk production once it has been established (galactopoietic effect). Although the initiation of lactation requires the coordinated action of several hormones, PRL is the classic lactogenic hormone. Initiation of milk production also necessitates the abrupt fall in estrogens and progesterone that accompanies parturition. PRL is also the primary hormone responsible for maintaining milk production once it has been initiated.

PRL binds to a tyrosine kinase-associated receptor (see p. 70) in the same family of receptors as the GH receptor. PRL receptors, which have equal affinities for GH, are present
in tissues such as breast, ovary, and liver. Presumably via pathways initiated by protein phosphorylation at tyrosine residues, PRL stimulates transcription of the genes that encode several milk proteins, including lactalbumin and casein.

Suckling is the most powerful physiological stimulus for PRL release. Nipple stimulation triggers PRL secretion via an afferent neural pathway through the spinal cord, thereby inhibiting dopaminergic neurons in the median eminence of the hypothalamus (Fig. 56-12). Because DA normally inhibits PRL release from the lactotrophs, it is called a
![bo540346323f](bo540346323f.jpg)

Figure 56-12 Effect of suckling on the release of PRL, OT, and GnRH. Suckling has four effects. First, it stimulates sensory nerves, which carry the signal from the breast to the spinal cord, where these nerves synapse with neurons that carry the signal to the brain. Second, in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, the afferent input from the nipple inhibits neurons that release DA. DA normally travels via the hypothalamicportal system to the anterior pituitary, where it inhibits PRL release by lactotrophs. Thus, inhibition of DA release leads to an increase in PRL release. Third, in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus, the afferent input from the nipple triggers the production and release of OT in the posterior pituitary. Fourth, in the preoptic area and arcuate nucleus, the afferent input from the nipple inhibits GnRH release. GnRH normally travels via the hypothalamic-portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it stimulates the synthesis and release of FSH and LH. Thus, inhibiting GnRH release inhibits FSH and LH release and thereby inhibits the ovarian cycle.

PRL-inhibitory factor (PIF). Thus, because suckling decreases DA delivery via the portal vessels, it relieves the inhibition on the lactotrophs in the anterior pituitary and stimulates bursts of PRL release. Treating women with DA receptor agonists rapidly inhibits PRL secretion and milk production.

Several factors act as PRL-releasing factors (PRFs): thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), angiotensin II, substance $P, \beta$ endorphin, and AVP. In rats, suckling stimulates the release of TRH from the hypothalamus. In lactating women, TRH leads to increased milk production. Estradiol modulates PRL release in two ways. First, estradiol increases the sensitivity of the lactotroph to stimulation by TRH. Second, estradiol decreases the sensitivity of the lactotroph to inhibition by DA.

During the first 3 weeks of the neonatal period, maternal PRL levels remain tonically elevated. Thereafter, PRL levels decrease to a constant baseline level that is higher than that observed in women who are not pregnant. If the mother does not nurse her young, PRL levels generally fall to nonpregnancy levels after 1 to 2 weeks. If the mother does breast-feed, increased PRL secretion is maintained for as long as suckling continues. Suckling causes episodic increases in PRL secretion with each feeding, thus producing peaks in PRL levels superimposed on the elevated baseline PRL levels. After the infant completes a session of nursing, PRL levels return to their elevated baseline and remain there until the infant nurses again.

## OT and psychic stimuli initiate milk ejection ("let-down")

OT, which can promote uterine contraction, also enhances milk ejection by stimulating the contraction of the network of myoepithelial cells surrounding the alveoli and ducts of the breast (galactokinetic effect). Nursing can sometimes cause uterine cramps. During nursing, suckling stimulates nerve endings in the nipple and triggers rapid bursts of OT release (see Fig. 56-12). This neurogenic reflex is transmitted through the spinal cord, the midbrain, and the hypothalamus, where it stimulates neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei that release OT from their nerve endings in the posterior pituitary. From the posterior pituitary, OT
enters the systemic circulation and eventually reaches the myoepithelial cells that are arranged longitudinally on the lactiferous ducts and around the alveoli in the breast (see Fig. 56-11C, D). Activation of OTRs causes these cells to contract by mechanisms similar to those for the contraction of uterine smooth muscle (see p. 1146). The result is to promote the release of pre-existing milk after 40 to 60 seconds, a process known as the let-down reflex.

In addition to the suckling stimulus, many different psychic stimuli emanating from the infant, as well as neuroendocrine factors, promote OT release. The site or sound of an infant may trigger milk let-down, a phenomenon observed in many mammals. Thus, the posterior pituitary releases OT episodically even in anticipation of suckling. Fear, anger, or other stresses suppress this psychogenic reflex, thus inhibiting OT release and suppressing milk outflow.

## Suckling inhibits the ovarian cycle

Lactation generally inhibits cyclic ovulatory function. Suckling likely reduces the release of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by neurons in the arcuate nucleus and the preoptic area of the hypothalamus (see Fig. 56-12). Normally, GnRH travels through the portal vessels to the gonadotrophs in the anterior pituitary. Thus, the decreased GnRH release induced by suckling reduces the secretion of folliclestimulating hormone (FSH) and LH and has a negative effect on ovarian function. As a result, breast-feeding delays ovulation and normal menstrual cycles. However, if the mother continues to nurse her infant for a prolonged period, ovulatory cycles will eventually resume. Suckling intensity and frequency, which decrease with the introduction of supplementary foods to the infant, determine the duration of anovulation and amenorrhea in well-nourished women. In breast-feeding women in Bangladesh, the period of anovulation averages 18 to 24 months. If the mother does not nurse her child after delivery, ovulatory cycles resume, on average, 8 to 10 weeks after delivery, with a range of up to 18 weeks.

# FETAL AND NEONATAL PHYSIOLOGY 

George Lister and Ervin E. Jones

Fetal development is a highly organized process. The most rapid phase of growth transpires in at a degree of hypoxemia that mimics ascent to Mount Everest, while nutrients reach the fetus indirectly, from the maternal circulation. The transition to the extrauterine environment occurs abruptly and is likewise extraordinarily well orchestrated. Indeed, within a matter of seconds, the breathing infant can supply sufficient oxygen to the tissues because of gas exchange in the previously fluid-filled newborn lung and rapid redirection of blood flow from fetal to adult pathways. Finally, the newborn must acclimate to its new milieu, where numerous homeostatic challenges confront the newly autonomous organs. Accordingly, the subchapters here address the growth of the fetus, the development of the cardiopulmonary system, the transition to the extrauterine environment, and early neonatal functions.

## BIOLOGY OF FETAL GROWTH

Growth of the fetus begins soon after fertilization, when the first cell division occurs. Cell division, hypertrophy, and differentiation are well-coordinated events that result in the growth and development of specialized organ systems. The fetus, fetal membranes, and placenta develop and function as a unit throughout pregnancy, and their development is interdependent. The growth trajectory of fetal mass is relatively flat during the first trimester, increases linearly at the beginning of the second trimester, and rises rapidly during the third trimester. Before addressing the details of growth, we describe the physiological factors that govern transport of nutrients and waste between the fetus and the placenta.

## Two distinct circulations-fetoplacental and uteroplacental-underlie the transfer of gases and nutrients

The fundamental difference between the circulatory system of the fetus and that of the infant/adult is the presence of the placenta, which produces essential hormones (e.g., progestins, estrogens, chorionic gonadotropins) and performs a number of vital functions (e.g., gas exchange, nutrient transport, fluid balance, and waste removal) that other systems provide in extrauterine life. The fetus accomplishes these tasks by directing a large fraction of fetal blood flow from the aorta via the two umbilical arteries to the fetoplacental
circulation within chorionic villi (see p. 1137). There the umbilical arteries branch into small tufts of vessels (villus capillaries) that come into apposition with the maternal uteroplacental circulation, which has a high blood flow (see pp. 1136-1137). The placental membranes (the syncytiotrophoblast) that separate these two distinct circulations permit the efficient exchange of respiratory gases, fluid, and larger molecules that are critical to sustain growth and maintain homeostasis. Accordingly, disturbances in the placental circulation or delivery of nutritive substrates can have serious consequences for the growth and development of the fetus.

The transfer of respiratory gases occurs by diffusion, driven by the partial pressure differences of these gases in various compartments, as is the case in the lungs after birth (see pp. 660-661). The uterine arterial blood enters the placenta with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 80 to 100 mm Hg , whereas umbilical arterial blood enters with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, so that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses from the uterine to the umbilical circulation. The result is that the effluent umbilical venous blood has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of about 35 to 50 mm Hg , whereas the uterine venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is consistently higher by 4 to 15 mm Hg . This difference is analogous to the alveolar-arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient (see p. 698). However, with some substances, such as creatinine, the concentration is the same in fetal and maternal blood. Amino acids are transported across the syncytiotrophoblast and then diffuse into the fetal circulation. Transfer of immunoglobin $G$, a protein that provides passive immunity from the mother, is by receptor-mediated endocytosis (see p. 42). Fluid movement obeys the principles of Starling forces (see pp. 467-468).

## Growth occurs by hyperplasia and hypertrophy

The growth of an organ occurs as a result of an increase in cell number (hyperplasia), an increase in cell size (hypertrophy), or both. Growth follows three sequential phases that are organ specific: (1) pure hyperplasia, (2) hyperplasia and concomitant hypertrophy, and (3) hypertrophy alone. For example, the placenta goes through all three phases of growth, but these phases are compressed because the placental life span is relatively short. Moreover, simple hypertrophy is the primary form of placental growth. Thus, the weight, RNA content, and protein content of the human placenta increase linearly until term, but cell number does not increase during the third trimester. Disturbances of placental growth have secondary consequences for the fetus. Perhaps the most

important factor that currently can be modified is maternal smoking, which contributes to a reduction of birth weight and raises the risk of chronic disease in the offspring, as both a child and an adult.

In contrast to placental growth and development, growth of the fetus occurs almost entirely by hyperplasia. Thus, DNA content increases linearly in all fetal organs beginning early in the second trimester. Stimuli that either increase or decrease cell number, cell size, or both may accelerate or retard the growth of the whole fetus or of individual organs. The phase of growth during which the stimulus acts determines the response of the organ. For example, chromosomal aneuploidy is likely to have an effect on growth throughout gestation, whereas malnutrition or substance abuse will impair growth only when the exposure is present. Although some effects-such as those of malnutrition on growthare reversible, there may also be long-term consequences for health.

## Growth depends primarily on genetic factors during the first half of gestation and on epigenetic factors thereafter

The fertilized egg contains the genetic material that directs cell multiplication and differentiation and guides development of the human phenotype. For specific developmental events to occur at precise times, a programmed sequence of gene activation and suppression is necessary. 0 N57-1 Ignoring apoptosis, the fertilized egg must undergo an average of $\sim 42$ divisions before newborn size is reached. A fertilized ovum weighing less than 1 ng gives rise to a newborn weighing slightly more than 3 kg (an increase of $>10^{12}$ fold). Not only must the total cell number in a term fetus lie within relatively narrow limits, but also the developmental program must trigger cell differentiation after a specified number of cell divisions. After birth, only approximately five additional divisions are necessary for the net increase in mass that is necessary to achieve adult size. However, many tissues (e.g., gastrointestinal tract, skin, blood cells) must continually undergo cell division to replenish cells lost by apoptosis.

Although the genetic makeup of the fetus principally determines its growth and development, other influencesboth stimulatory and inhibitory-are superimposed on the genetic program. During the first half of pregnancy, the fetus's own genetic program is the primary determinant of growth, and thus constrains patterns of growth. During the second half of pregnancy, the patterns of growth and development are more variable. The four primary epigenetic factors at work during the second half of pregnancy are placental, hormonal, environmental (e.g., maternal nutrition), and metabolic (e.g., diabetes). We discuss the first two factors (placental and hormonal) in the next two sections.

Studies in both healthy and growth-restricted infants have identified the important determinants of newborn body mass (Fig. 57-1). The use of fetal ultrasonography now permits repetitive determination of measures of fetal growth, such as femur length, distance between the two parietal eminences of the head (biparietal diameter), head circumference, and abdominal circumference. For example, a healthy male infant gains 25 to $30 \mathrm{~g} /$ day during the last trimester of

pregnancy. The ultrasound measurements provide valuable information about growth during gestation, whereas previously we made assumptions based solely on birth weight.

The mother's contribution to the fetal environment includes maternal health and nutritional status, age (e.g., adolescents and older women have infants with lower birth weight), parity, prepregnancy weight and prenatal weight gain, height, and cigarette smoking, although factors vary in importance depending on the environment (e.g., maternal infection with malaria is a significant factor in endemic areas). The father contributes to birth weight only via the genes that he passes on to his child, with the correlation between father and infant being $\sim 12 \%$. The correlation with maternal weight is $\sim 22 \%$. From observations in cases of oocyte donation, it is apparent that newborn weight is related more to anthropometric measures of the mother than of the father. The paternal body size has a small influence on fetal lean mass, and fetal sex also has a small effect (males have somewhat higher lean body mass). Multiparity and premature birth both correlate with low birth weight, and both have become more common with artificial fertilization techniques.

## Increases in placental mass parallel periods of rapid fetal growth

The placenta plays several important roles in fetal growth and development. In addition to serving transport and storage functions, the placenta is involved in numerous biosynthetic activities. These include the synthesis of steroids, such as estrogen and progesterone, and of protein hormones, such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and the human chorionic somatomammotropins (hCSs; see p. 1139).

Fetal growth closely correlates with placental weight and trophoblast surface area. During periods of rapid fetal growth, placental weight increases. As the placental mass increases, the total surface area of the placental villi (see p. 1136) increases to sustain gas transport and fetal nutrition.

# BOX 57-1 Growth Restriction 

$G$rowth restriction is an important common pathway for many conditions that significantly increase infant morbidity and mortality, and it is also associated with many shortor long-term consequences. Some of the most important morbidities associated with growth restriction are birth asphyxia, neonatal hypoglycemia, necrotizing enterocolitis, hypocalcemia, meconium aspiration, persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn, pulmonary hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, polycythemia, delayed neurological development, and hypothermia.

Two general terms describe an abnormality of fetal growth: (1) small for gestational age, which is based on birth weight; and (2) intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), which is based on the rate of fetal growth as detected by ultrasonography. Both terms describe infants who, for a variety of reasons, weigh much less than population-based norms (based on fetal growth curves); we will use the term IUGR.

IUGR has been variously defined as a birth weight lower than the 3rd, 5th, or 10th percentile for gestational age, or a birth weight that is more than two standard deviations lower than the mean for gestational age. Similar norms for body length and head circumference permit us to characterize growth restriction and determine whether it is symmetrical (i.e., anthropometric factors are uniformly decreased) or asymmetrical (e.g., weight is affected more than length, which is affected more than head growth). These distinctions are made by obtaining careful measurements at birth and then plotting length, weight, and head circumference on standard curves for the appropriate sex, gestational age, and comparable population.

The three general categories of IUGR are related to the time of onset of the pathological process as follows.

Symmetrical IUGR applies to infants whose length, weight, and abdominal and head circumferences are all less than the 10th percentile for gestational age. This type usually results from longstanding growth limitation that arises during early stages of fetal
development (4 to 20 weeks' gestation). The result is fewer cells in the fetus. Causes include intrauterine infections (e.g., rubella, cytomegalovirus infection), chromosomal disorders, and congenital malformations. Maternal drug ingestion, excessive alcohol consumption, and smoking can also produce this pattern depending upon the length of exposure. Of fetuses with severe, early onset of growth restriction, $\sim 25 \%$ have aneuploidy (i.e., abnormal number of chromosomes). The symmetrically diminished growth of these fetuses may result from inhibition of mitosis during early development.

Asymmetrical IUGR, which accounts for $70 \%$ to $80 \%$ of growth restriction in fetuses, is most frequently caused by uteroplacental insufficiency. Compared to symmetrical IUGR, this type of growth restriction results from an insult that occurs either later in gestation (usually after 28 weeks) or more briefly. Late in the second trimester, hypertrophy dominates as the means for growth and there is a rapid increase in cell size and increases in the formation of fat, muscle, bone, and other tissues. For fetuses with asymmetrical growth restriction, head growth is less impaired than weight gain. This form of IUGR is most often associated with small placentas and maternal conditions such as kidney disease, chronic hypertension, severe diabetes mellitus, or multiple gestation.

Intermediate IUGR is a combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical IUGR, accounting for $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of all cases of fetal growth restriction. It probably occurs during the middle phase of fetal growth (20 to 28 weeks), between the hyperplastic and hypertrophic phases. During this middle period, mitotic rate decreases and overall cell size increases progressively. Chronic hypertension, lupus nephritis, or other vascular diseases in the mother that are severe and begin early in the second trimester may result in intermediate IUGR in the fetus, with symmetrical growth and no significant brain-sparing effect.

Moreover, maternal blood flow to the uterus and fetal blood flow to the placenta also increase in parallel with the increase in placental mass. Placental growth increases linearly until $\sim 4$ weeks before birth, and adequate placental reserve is particularly important during the third trimester, when fetal growth is very rapid. Fetal growth restriction (Box 57-1) can occur as a result of decreased placental reserve caused by any insult. For example, mothers who smoke during pregnancy tend to have small placentas and are at high risk of delivering a low-birth-weight baby.

## Insulin, the insulin-like growth factors, and thyroxine stimulate fetal growth

In Chapter 48, we discussed several hormones-including glucocorticoids, insulin, growth hormone (GH), the insulinlike growth factors (IGFs), and thyroid hormones-that are important for achieving final adult mass.

Glucocorticoids and Insulin As its major energy source, the growing fetus uses glucose, which moves across the placenta by facilitated diffusion via the glucose transporter GLUT1 (see p. 114). Unlike the adult, who uses sophisticated hormonal systems to control blood glucose levels
(pp. 1035-1050, 1050-1053, 1018-1026, and 1033), the fetus is passive: the exchange of glucose across the placenta controls fetal blood glucose levels. The fetus normally has little need for gluconeogenesis, and the levels of gluconeogenic enzymes in the fetal liver are low. Glucocorticoids in the fetus promote the storage of glucose as glycogen in the fetal liver, a process that increases greatly during the final month of gestation in preparation for the increased glycolytic activity required during and immediately after delivery. Near term, when fetal glucose metabolism becomes sensitive to insulin, this hormone contributes to the storage of glucose as glycogen, as well as to the uptake and utilization of amino acids and lipogenesis (see pp. 1035-1050). In mice, knockout of the insulin receptor causes slight growth restriction in the fetus, whereas the additional knockout of the insulin gene severely reduces birth weight. Transient increases in maternal blood glucose levels after meals are closely mirrored by increases in fetal blood glucose levels. However, maternal insulin cannot cross the placenta, and this transient fetal hyperglycemia leads to increased fetal production of insulin.

Sustained hyperglycemia in mothers with poorly controlled diabetes (see Box 51-5) causes sustained fetal hyperglycemia, and therefore fetal hyperinsulinemia. The resulting high levels of fetal insulin, which is a growth factor (see

pp. 999-1000), increase both the size of fetal organs (organomegaly) and fetal body mass (macrosomia; see p. 999). During the last half of the third trimester, fetal weight in pregnant women with poorly controlled diabetes generally exceeds that in normal pregnant women. In some cases, large fetal size leads to problems at delivery, prompting cesarean section. However, in mothers with severe diabetes, the placenta shows evidence of vascular insufficiency and the infants may be growth restricted.

Insulin-Like Growth Factors Postnatally, GH acts by binding to the GH receptor (GHR; see p. 994), primarily in the liver, and triggering the production of somatomedin or IGF-1. IGF-2 is not so much under the control of GH. The IGF-1 receptor is similar, but not identical, to the insulin receptor and can bind both IGF-1 and IGF-2, as well as insulin (see p. 996). In the fetus, both IGF-1 and IGF-2, which are mitogenic peptides, are extremely important for growth. IGF-1 and IGF-2 are present in the fetal circulation from the end of the first trimester, and their levels increase thereafter in both mother and fetus. Birth weight correlates positively with IGF levels. However, both relative levels of the IGFs and control of the IGFs are very different in the fetal stage than they are postnatally. First, fetal IGF-2 levels are much higher than IGF-1 levels; soon after birth, IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels resemble those in adults. Second, in the fetus, both IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels correlate poorly with GH levels. GH levels, which are much higher than postnatally, may have only a limited influence on fetal growth because GHRs are not as abundant (e.g., in liver) as they are after birth. This observation may explain why anencephalic fetuses (see Box 10-2), which have low GH levels, generally grow normally in utero. On the other hand, GH-deficient infants are often shorter than normal infants.

Epidermal Growth Factor The fetus has abundant epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptors (see p. 68), and EGF is well known for its mitogenic properties, especially with regard to development of ectodermal and mesodermal structures. However, the fetus has no detectable mRNA encoding EGF. On the other hand, transforming growth factor- $\alpha$ (TGF- $\alpha$ ), another potent mitogen that binds to EGF receptors on target cells, may act as a ligand for the EGF receptor; its mRNA is present widely in human fetal tissues.

Thyroid Hormones The thyroid hormones are obligatory for normal growth and development (see pp. 1013-1014). Before the second trimester, most of the thyroxine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{4}\right)$ in the fetus is maternal. Fetal production of thyrotropin (or thyroid-stimulating hormone [TSH]) and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ begin to increase in the second trimester, concurrent with development of the hypothalamic-pituitary portal system. Hypothyroidism has adverse effects on fetal growth, generally reflected as a reduction in the size of organs such as the heart, kidney, liver, muscle, and spleen.

Peptide Hormones Peptide hormones secreted by the placenta (see Table 56-4) can act via endocrine, paracrine, and autocrine mechanisms to stimulate growth and differentiation in several organ systems.

## Many fetal tissues produce red blood cells early in gestation

During early gestation, islands of cells form within the yolk sac, some of which become primitive blood cells or hemocytoblasts. This phase of hematopoiesis ends by 6 weeks' gestation. Later, red blood cell (RBC) production (erythropoiesis; see pp. 431-433) occurs in many tissues not normally thought of as erythropoietic in the adult. At about the fourth week of gestation, the endothelium of blood vessels and the mesenchyme also begin to contribute to the pool of RBCs, followed shortly by the liver. The bone marrow, spleen, and other lymphoid tissues begin to produce RBCs only near the end of the first trimester. All these organ systems except bone marrow gradually lose their ability to manufacture blood cells, and by the third trimester, the bone marrow becomes the dominant source of blood cells.

RBCs formed early in gestation are nucleated, but as fetal development progresses, more and more of the circulatory RBCs are non-nucleated. The blood volume in the common circulation of the fetoplacental unit increases as the fetus grows. The fraction of total RBCs that are reticulocytes (NS7-2 (immature, non-nucleated erythrocytes with residual polyribosomes) is high in the young fetus, but it decreases to only $\sim 5 \%$ at term. In the adult, the reticulocyte count is normally $<1 \%$. The life span of fetal RBCs depends on the age of the fetus; in a term fetus, it is $\sim 80$ days, or two thirds that in an adult (see pp. 431-433); it is shorter in the less mature fetus.

Embryonic hemoglobin (Hb) with different combinations of $\alpha$-type chains ( $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ ) and $\beta$-type chains ( $\varepsilon$ and $\gamma$; see Table 29-1) is present very early in gestation. Production of $\zeta$ and $\varepsilon$ chains ceases by 8 weeks, and programmed development (5) N4-5 governs increased synthesis of fetal Hb (HbF, $\alpha, \gamma_{2}$ ), which predominates at birth. Adult $\mathrm{Hb}(\mathrm{HbA}$, $\alpha_{2} \beta_{2}$ ) and a small amount of $\mathrm{HbA}_{2}\left(\alpha_{2} \delta_{3}\right)$ gradually replace HbF during the first 12 months of life until eventually the adult pattern of Hb expression is established (see Table 29-2). An exception is in certain genetic abnormalities of $\alpha$ - or $\beta$ chain production (e.g., thalassemia), in which HbF persists.

The Hb content ([Hb]) of fetal blood rises to $\sim 15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ by midgestation, equivalent to the level in normal men (see p. 434) and higher than [Hb] in maternal blood, which may be only $\sim 12 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$. Fetal $[\mathrm{Hb}]$ increases near term and is $\sim 17 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ in full-term infants and slightly less in premature infants. Postnatally, a substantial decrease in [Hb], with a nadir of $\sim 11 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ near 2 months of age, is termed the physiological anemia of infancy because it does not respond to administration of iron or other hematinic agents. This level of anemia does not affect the well-being of an otherwise healthy infant. However, infants who are born prematurely (and therefore with a lower nadir) or who have other disturbances in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport (e.g., hypoxemia, impaired cardiac output) can exhibit irritability, failure to grow normally, or tissue hypoxia.

## The fetal gastrointestinal and urinary systems excrete products into the amniotic fluid by midpregnancy

The fetus imbibes considerable quantities of amniotic fluid by 20 weeks' gestation. However, not until the final

# N57-2 Reticulocytes 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As discussed on pages 431-433, reticulocytes are immature erythrocytes (also known as red blood cells, or RBCs). These cells are called reticulocytes-or "retics" in the slangbecause certain stains (e.g., new methylene blue) reveal a mesh-like "reticular" network due to the presence of ribosomal RNA.

In the adult, retics make up about $1 \%$ of all RBCs.

12 weeks of gestation is fetal gastrointestinal function similar to that of the normal infant at term. The fetal gastrointestinal tract continuously excretes small amounts of meconium into the amniotic fluid. Meconium consists of excretory products from the gastrointestinal mucosa and glands, along with unabsorbed residua from the imbibed amniotic fluid.

By the beginning of the second trimester, the fetus also begins to urinate. Fetal urine constitutes $\sim 75 \%$ of amnioticfluid production (see p. 1137). The fetal renal system does not acquire the capacity to regulate fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balance until the beginning of the third trimester. Although the fetus has its final number of nephrons by 34 to 36 weeks' gestation, full development of renal function does not occur until several months following delivery, owing primarily to continued development of renal tubules and increased renal blood flow.

## A surge in protein synthesis, with an increase in muscle mass, is a major factor in the rapid fetal weight gain during the third trimester

Fetal tissues constantly synthesize and break down proteins. Protein synthesis predominates throughout gestation, especially during the third trimester, when fetal protein synthesis-primarily in muscle and liver-increases 3- to 4 -fold. The number of ribosomes per cell increases throughout gestation and early postnatal life. The efficiency of ribosomes at translating mRNA may also improve during gestation. Substrate availability (i.e., amino acids) and modulation of the synthetic apparatus by endocrine and other factors play important roles in regulating protein synthesis during gestation.

The formation of each peptide bond requires four molecules of ATP, so the energy cost of protein synthesis is $0.86 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. Protein synthesis comprises $15 \%$ to $20 \%$ of fetal metabolic expenditure in the third trimester. At equivalent phases of development, fetuses across several species invest similar fractions of total energy in protein synthesis. Because glucose is the major metabolic fuel, a shortfall of oxidized metabolic substrates (e.g., glucose and lactate) directly limits protein synthesis.

Increases in skeletal muscle mass account for $25 \%$ to $50 \%$ of fetal weight gain during the second half of gestation, when the number of muscle cells increases 8 -fold and cell volume increases $\sim 2.6$-fold. Although skeletal muscle fibers are not differentiated in the first half of gestation, distinct type I and type II muscle fibers (see pp. 249-250) appear in equal amounts between 20 and 26 weeks of gestation.

## Fetal lipid stores increase rapidly during the third trimester

Fetal fat stores account for only $1 \%$ of fetal body weight during the first trimester. By the third trimester, as much as $15 \%$ of fetal body weight is fat. At birth, humans have more fat than other warm-blooded animals (e.g., the newborn cat has $2 \%$; the guinea pig, $9.5 \%$; the rat, $11 \%$ ), with the exception of hibernating mammals and migratory birds.

Approximately half the increase in body fat reflects increased lipid transport across the placenta, and the other
half reflects increased fatty acid (FA) synthesis in the fetal liver. Blood levels of fetal lipids (i.e., triacylglycerols, FAs, and ketone bodies) remain low before 32 weeks' gestation. In the last 2 months, the fetus increases its lipid storage as triacylglycerols in white and brown adipose tissue as well as in liver. During this period, both subcutaneous fat (i.e., white fat) and deep fat (i.e., white and brown fat) increase exponentially. The stored fat ensures adequate fuel stores for postnatal survival, and it also provides thermal insulation to the newborn. In addition, brown fat is important for thermogenesis in the postnatal period.

Several factors are responsible for increased lipid stores in the near-term fetus. Increases in fetal albumin facilitate FA transfer across the placenta. Insulin acts on fetal hepatocytes to stimulate lipogenesis. Insulin also promotes the availability of substrates, including glucose and lactate, which in turn increase the synthesis of fat (see pp. 1047-1050).

## DEVELOPMENT AND MATURATION OF THE CARDIOPULMONARY SYSTEM

## Fetal lungs develop by repetitive branching of both bronchial and pulmonary arterial trees

Two critical factors make gas exchange in the infant lung as effective as that in the adult lung: (1) the structural growth and coincident branching of lung segments and blood vessels that creates an extensive alveolar-capillary interface for efficient diffusion of gases, and (2) the production of surfactant (see pp. 613-615), which permits lung expansion without excessive inspiratory effort. The fetal lung begins as an outpouching of the foregut at $\sim 24$ days' gestation. Several days later, this lung bud branches into two tubular structures, the precursors of the main bronchi. At 4 to 6 weeks' gestation, the bronchial tree begins to branch repetitively. The further maturation of the lungs occurs in four overlapping phases:

1. Pseudoglandular period ( 5 to 17 weeks). The lung "airways" resemble branching exocrine glands, with acinar buds forming in the peripheral lung.
2. Canalicular period ( 16 to 26 weeks). The creation of channels (canalization) within the airways is complete when $\sim 17$ generations of airways have formed, including the respiratory bronchioles. Each respiratory bronchiole gives rise to as many as six alveolar ducts, which give rise to the primitive alveoli during the second trimester. The branching of the pulmonary arterial tree, which begins during the pseudoglandular period, parallels both temporally and spatially the branching of the bronchial tree. However, at $\sim 24$ weeks' gestation, considerable interstitial tissue separates the capillaries from the respiratory epithelium. (○) NS7-3
3. Saccular period ( 24 to 38 weeks). The respiratory epithelium thins greatly, with loss of connective tissue, and the capillaries push into the alveolar sacs. The potential for gas exchange improves after $\sim 24$ weeks' gestation, when capillaries proliferate and come into closer proximity to the thin type I alveolar pneumocytes (see p. 599). During this period, surfactant synthesis and storage begin (although not extensively) in the differentiated type II cells.

# N57-3 Alveolar-Capillary Distances in the Fetus at 24 Weeks 

Contributed by Henry Binder
If the fetus were born at 24 weeks of development, the premature infant would have a very low diffusing capacity (see pp. 663-664) owing to the great distance between the edge of the alveolar lumen and the edge of the capillary lumen.

4. Alveolar period (late fetal life through early childhood). Alveoli-like structures are present at $\sim 32$ weeks' gestation, and at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation, $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of the adult number of alveoli are present. Alveolar number continues to increase until as late as 8 years of age.

## An increase in cortisol, with other hormones, triggers surfactant production in the third trimester

Hormones play a major role in controlling fetal lung growth and development in preparation for ex utero function. A key target is surfactant (see pp. 613-615), which increases lung compliance (see pp. 615-616) and thereby reduces the effort of inspiration. Numerous hormones stimulate surfactant biosynthesis, including glucocorticoids, thyroid hormones, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, and prolactin, as well as growth factors such as EGF. Glucocorticoids, in particular, play an essential role in stimulating fetal lung maturation by increasing the number of both type II pneumocytes and lamellar bodies (see pp. 614-615) within these cells.

Glucocorticoid receptors are probably present in lung tissue at midterm. Fetal cortisol levels rise steadily during the third trimester and surge just before birth. Two thirds of this cortisol is of fetal origin; the rest crosses the placenta from the mother.

The predominant phospholipid in surfactant is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC; see pp. 613-614). At $\sim 32$ weeks' gestation, increases in cortisol and the other hormones mentioned previously stimulate several regulatory enzymes. 0 N57-4 Thus, the net effect is vastly increased production of pulmonary surfactant late in gestation. Coincident with increased surfactant synthesis is a large increase in lung distensibility and stability on inflation. However, in infants born prematurely with insufficient surfactant and lungs that are not structurally mature, severe respiratory distress (Box 57-2) can result. Because of the surfactant deficiency, the infant must invest excessive work to create an adequate tidal volume with each breath and to maintain a normal functional residual capacity following expiration.

# 80X 57-2 Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome 

I ifant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), which affects $\sim 30,000$ newborns annually in the United States, is characterized by increased work of breathing (nasal flaring, the use of accessory musculature, intercostal and subcostal retractions, tachypnea, and grunting) and impaired gas exchange (cyanosis). Retractions occur because the lungs-with collapsed, fluidfilled, and poorly expanded alveoli-are less compliant than the chest wall, with nonossified ribs. The increased inspiratory effort to expand the noncompliant lungs creates a very negative intrapleural pressure. As a result, the chest wall becomes distorted, caving in between the ribs or beneath or above the rib cage, so that the increased inspiratory work does not much improve tidal volume. The more immature the infant, the more severe and life-threatening the lung disease and the more likely that signs of respiratory distress become apparent immediately after birth or within a few minutes. 0 N57-10

In more mature preterm infants, the signs of IRDS may evolve over several hours. A chest radiograph reveals atelectasis with air bronchograms (i.e., air-filled bronchi standing out against the white background of collapsed lung tissue) and pulmonary edema. The edema and consolidation or collapse of alveoli can produce severe restrictive lung disease (see p. 611) and subsequent fatigue from the increased effort needed to breathe, contributing to respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. Milder cases usually resolve spontaneously. IRDS occurs most commonly in premature infants, and the course is often confounded by the coexistence of a patent ductus arteriosus (see p. 1158), poor nutrition, and risk of infection. This combination of problems also raises the risk of short- and long-term complications, such as disruption of lung development (bronchopulmonary dysplasia), necrotizing enterocolitis, and intraventricular hemorrhage.

IRDS is usually caused by a deficiency of pulmonary surfactant owing to prematurity. Prematurity is by far the single most important risk factor for development of IRDS; others include male sex, delivery by cesarean section, perinatal asphyxia, second twin pregnancy, maternal diabetes, and deficiency of surfactant protein B or the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein ABCA3 (see p. 119). Surfactant insufficiency can result from abnormalities of surfactant synthesis, secretion, or recycling.

Reduced surfactant lowers compliance directly (see pp. 615-616) and further lowers compliance indirectly because alveoli-with their propensity to collapse-tend to be on the lowest, flat part of the lung pressure-volume curve (stage 1 in Fig. 27-4B). Because of the tendency of alveoli to collapse, blood perfuses poorly ventilated or nonventilated alveoli, which results in hypoxemia (see pp. 692-693). In the extreme, when the alveoli are nonventilated, the result is venous admixture or shunt (see p. 693). In addition, capillary damage allows leakage into the alveolar space of plasma proteins, which may inactivate surfactant and thereby exacerbate the underlying condition.

The discovery that a deficiency of surfactant is the underlying problem in infants with IRDS prompted investigators to (1) develop means to assess fetal lung maturity and adequacy of surfactant production before delivery, (2) stimulate surfactant production in the fetus (by administration of corticosteroids to the mother prior to delivery), and (3) provide exogenous surfactant to the lungs until native synthesis occurs. As indicated in the following three paragraphs, each of these strategies has been a successful step in dramatically reducing the incidence and severity of IRDS.

Knowledge of lung maturity helps reduce complications in infants who are born prematurely or need to be delivered prematurely for specific medical indications related to the health of the mother or the infant. Clinical tests for assessing lung maturity exploit the knowledge that the major surfactant lipids are phosphatidylcholines (i.e., lecithins) and that phosphatidylglycerol (see pp. 613-614) is also overrepresented. A ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin (L/S ratio) $>2.0$ in the amniotic fluid is consistent with mature lungs, as is a positive result on phosphatidylglycerol assay.

Regarding surfactant production, the 2000 National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Antenatal Corticosteroids Revisited recommended antenatal steroid therapy for pregnant women with fetuses between 24 and 34 weeks' gestational age who are at risk of preterm delivery within 7 days. This treatment accelerates lung maturation and surfactant production and diminishes the incidence of IRDS.

Finally, the postnatal administration of surfactant has dramatically reduced the mortality and improved the clinical course of IRDS, as illustrated for an experimental animal in Figure 57-2.

# N57-4 Fetal Synthesis of Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

The predominant phospholipid in surfactant is DPPC (see pp. 613-614), which is synthesized as outlined in eFigure 57-1. Abundant glycogen stores in fetal type II pneumocytes serve as a primary energy and carbon source for the FAs involved in phospholipid synthesis. The condensation of diacylglycerol with cytosine diphosphate choline ultimately leads to the production of DPPC. At 32 weeks' gestation, increases in cortisol and other hormones stimulate several regulatory enzymes, including acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase, FA synthase, and CTP: phosphocholine cytidylyl transferase. The net effect is vastly increased production of pulmonary surfactant late in gestation. Coincident with increased surfactant synthesis is a large increase in lung distensibility and stability on inflation.

# N57-10 Respiratory Distress Syndrome of the Newborn 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Two of the signs of infant respiratory distress described in Box 57-2-cyanosis and tachypnea-reflect central hypoxemia, that is, reduced oxygen content of the arterial blood. In this case, the hypoxemia is the result of poor alveolar ventilation. As described on page 652, cyanosis is the purplish color of poorly saturated Hb . As described in Box 32-2, tachypnea is an increase in respiratory rate, in this case probably caused by stimulation of both the central and peripheral chemoreceptors due to respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.

Several of the other signs described in Box 57-2-nasal flaring, intercostal and subcostal retractions, the use of accessory musculature, and grunting-are indications of low lung compliance. Nasal flaring (produced by cranial nerve VII; see Fig. 32-4) is a reflection of the increased inspiratory drive and is produced by one of the secondary muscles of inspiration (see point 4upper respiratory tract muscles-on page 607). Other accessory or secondary muscles of inspiration also come into play. The
intercostal and subcostal retractions are the result of the very negative intrapleural pressure $\left(P_{I P}\right)$ generated by the young patient in an attempt to inflate its poorly compliant alveoli. Grunting is the sound made by closure of the glottis as the infant halts expiration at a lung volume $\left(V_{L}\right)$ that is considerably higher than the true functional residual capacity (FRC) to which the lungs would deflate without grunting. This true FRC would be quite low, owing to the extremely high elastic recoil of these lowsurfactant lungs. One might think of the relatively high $V_{L}$ at the point of grunting as a "pseudo-FRC" from which the infant can begin the next inspiration with much less effort than if $V_{L}$ had been allowed to fall all the way to the true FRC. The reason that the effort is so much less at the $V_{L}$ of grunting is that the $P_{1 P}-V_{L}$ relationship (see Fig. 27-4B) is highly nonlinear, such that the compliance (i.e., the slope of the $\mathrm{P}_{1 \mathrm{P}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve) is much higher at the $V_{L}$ of grunting than at the $V_{L}$ of the true FRC.

## Fetal respiratory movements begin near the end of the first trimester but wane just before birth

Fetal breathing movements commence near the end of the first trimester, as confirmed in humans by studies using both Doppler ultrasonography and tocodynamometer (an external device that records uterine movements). It appears that hypoxia and tactile stimulation of the fetus promote these breathing movements, which occupy less than half of any 24-hour period. Near term, breathing movements are regular, similar to those found after birth. However, just before labor, fetal breathing decreases. In experimental animals, reducing breathing limits growth and expansion of the lungs.

The fetal lung undergoes many changes in preparation for birth. In utero, the alveoli and airways of the fetal lung are filled with a volume of fluid approximating the functional residual capacity (see p. 602) of the neonatal lung. The onset of labor is accompanied by increases in catecholamines and arginine vasopressin, which decrease fluid production by the fetal lung and initiate active fluid reabsorption via epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels ( ENaCs ). The reabsorbed fluid moves out of the lung mainly via the pulmonary circulation and to a lesser extent via the pulmonary lymphatics. The small portion of remaining lung fluid is forced out of the trachea as the fetus passes through the birth canal (Box 57-3).

## The fetal circulation has four unique pathways-placenta, ductus venosus, foramen ovale, and ductus arteriosus-to facilitate gas and nutrient exchange

The circulatory system differentiates from the embryonic mesoderm, and the fetal heart begins to beat and circulate blood in the fourth week of gestation. The fundamental difference between the fetal and postnatal circulations is that the placenta performs for the fetus functions thatat least in part-are performed by four organ systems in extrauterine life: (1) the lungs (gas exchange), (2) the

## BOX 57-3 Fetal Asphyxia

A
ny disturbance that abruptly interferes with the ability of the placenta to exchange $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the maternal and fetal circulations can lead to fetal asphyxia-low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and acidosis. Common causes include maternal hypotension, abruptio placentae (i.e., breaking away of a portion of the placenta from the uterine wall), a prolapsed umbilical cord (i.e., descent of the umbilical cord into the birth canal in front of the head or other part of the fetus so that it becomes compressed), and severe anemia or polycythemia (which can occur with twintwin transfusion). A major consequence of the asphyxia is depressed myocardial function and reduced cardiac output, which further exacerbates the reduced $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the tissues.

In the brain, asphyxia produces substantial alterations in cerebral intracellular metabolism. As the brain is forced to shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism, high-energy phosphate compounds (e.g., ATP) decrease in concentration, and their breakdown products (e.g., ADP and inorganic phosphate) increase. The changes in metabolism disrupt the integrity of neurons and glia. Damage to the endothelium can cause hemorrhage with the brain parenchyma, ventricles, or choroid plexus.

Fetuses experiencing chronic $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ deficiency in utero for a prolonged period are at increased risk after birth of metabolic derangements as well as cerebral and intraventricular hemorrhage.
gastrointestinal tract (nutrition), (3) the liver (nutrition, waste removal), and (4) the kidneys (fluid and electrolyte balance, waste removal).

Just as in the mature circulation, the fetal right ventricle pumps most of its output to the gas-exchange organ (i.e., the placenta). The fetal left ventricle pumps most of its output to systemic tissues. The key principle governing the unique pattern of fetal blood flow is the presence of three shunts

that allow blood to bypass future postnatal routes and instead direct a large fraction of deoxygenated blood to the placenta. Just as in the postnatal circulation, the relative vascular resistance of an organ determines the fraction of cardiac output distributed to that organ. Thus, the fetal heart pumps a large fraction of its output to the low-resistance placenta and smaller fractions to other organs that, in utero, have relatively high vascular resistance.

Figure 57-3 shows the placenta and the three shunts. Because the right and left fetal hearts largely pump in parallel rather than in series, and because the inputs and outputs of these two sides mix, we define the combined cardiac output (CCO) as the sum of the outputs of the right and left ventricles. Figure 57-3A shows the fraction of the CCO that flows through the fetal circulatory system at important checkpoints. Figure 57-3B shows representative values for the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of HbF and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at these same checkpoints.

Placenta Of the CCO late in gestation, $\sim 69 \%$ reaches the thoracic aorta (see Fig. 57-3A). About $50 \%$ of the CCO enters the placenta as deoxygenated blood through the paired umbilical arteries, which arise from the two common iliac arteries. This massive blood flow to the placenta not only shunts blood away from the lower trunk, but also lowers effective blood flow to all abdominal viscera, including the kidneys. The umbilical arteries branch repeatedly to form dense capillary networks within the villi (see p. 1136). As fetal blood enters the placenta, it has a lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ than maternal blood, so that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ passively diffuses from maternal to fetal blood. After $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ equilibration across the placental membranes, the fetal blood has a higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content (see p. 650) than maternal blood because (1) HbF has a higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity than does HbA , and (2) fetal blood has a higher Hb content than maternal blood. The single umbilical vein returns well-oxygenated blood ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $85 \%$ ) from the placenta to the fetus.

Ductus Venosus The relatively large volume of welloxygenated umbilical venous blood ( $\sim 50 \%$ of CCO) returns to the lower body from the placenta but bypasses the largely nonfunctional liver by shunting through the ductus venosus-the fetal first shunt. In addition, some blood from the portal circulation enters the ductus venosus. Blood from the ductus venosus then merges with blood from the inferior vena cava ( $\sim 19 \%$ of CCO) that drains the lower limbs, kidneys, and splanchnic organs. Thus, $\sim 69 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right.$ of $70 \%$ ) enters the right atrium.

Foramen Ovale The second major shunt is blood entering the right atrium and then crossing the foramen ovale-an oval hole between two flaps of tissue in the septum that divides the atria $\bigcirc$ NSF-S-to enter the left atrium. Of the $69 \%$ of the CCO that enters the right atrium via the inferior vena cava, $\sim 27 \%$ of the CCO shunts through the foramen ovale directly into the left atrium. This movement represents a right-to-left shunt. Therefore, the left heart receives relatively well-oxygenated blood ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 70 \%$ ) derived from the mixing of blood from the placenta and the caudal portion of the inferior vena cava. In addition, the left atrium receives $7 \%$ of the CCO as poorly oxygenated blood ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 46 \%$ ) from
the nonfunctional lungs. Thus, the left ventricle pumps a total of $27 \%+7 \%=34 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 65 \%\right)$. Because this blood enters the aorta upstream from the ductus arteriosus, it primarily flows to the coronary circulation, head, and forelimbs.

In the right atrium, $69 \%-27 \%=42 \%$ of the CCO entering the right atrium from the inferior vena cava does not shunt through the foramen ovale. This relatively welloxygenated blood ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 70 \%$ ) joins the relatively poorly oxygenated $21 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 29 \%\right.$ ) that enters the right atrium from the superior vena cava and another $3 \%$ from the coronary vessels-a total of $24 \%$ of CCO. Because of the valve-like nature of the septum surrounding the foramen ovale, none of the incoming blood from the superior vena cava or coronary vessels shunts through the foramen ovale. Rather, it goes through the tricuspid valve to the right ventricle. Thus, the right ventricle receives $42 \%+21 \%+3 \%=$ $66 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 55 \%\right)$. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the fetal right ventricle is somewhat lower than that in the left ventricle. The blood from the right ventricle then enters the trunk of the pulmonary artery.

The right ventricle has a much larger stroke volume and pumps far more blood ( $66 \%$ of CCO) than the left ( $34 \%$ of CCO). Thus, the right ventricle has a relatively thick wall compared to its postnatal state and larger chamber volume in utero than the left ventricle. This difference is revealed in the electrocardiogram (ECG) of the newborn, which shows large right ventricular vectors and right-axis deviation compared with that of the older infant or adult. Despite the disparity in stroke volume, the two ventricles in utero pump at the same pressures because the low-resistance ductus arteriosus accepts nearly $90 \%$ of the output of the right ventricle.

Ductus Arteriosus The third major shunt, also a right-toleft shunt, directs blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta via the ductus arteriosus. The ductus arteriosus is a large vessel with substantial smooth muscle in its wall. The patency of this vessel is due to active relaxation of this smooth muscle, mediated by the low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the perfusing blood and prostaglandins, particularly prostaglandin $\mathbf{E}_{2}\left(\mathbf{P G E}_{2}\right)$. Note that the ductus arteriosus exhibits hypoxic vasodilation, as do most systemic vessels (see p. 478). Fetal $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ levels are much higher than adult levels. Administering prostaglandin inhibitors to an experimental fetal animal causes the ductus arteriosus to vasoconstrict.

Although $66 \%$ of the CCO enters the pulmonary artery, only $7 \%$ of the CCO perfuses the unventilated fetal lungs. This dichotomy reflects the high resistance of the fetal pulmonary, which is the result of hypoxic vasoconstriction (see p. 687) and acidosis, the collapsed state of the airways, and perhaps leukotrienes (particularly leukotriene $\mathrm{D}_{5}\left[\mathrm{LTD}_{5}\right]$ ). The rest of the blood entering the pulmonary artery, $66 \%$ $7 \%=59 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 55 \%\right)$, enters the descending aorta through the ductus arteriosus and mixes with the blood from the aortic arch, $10 \%$ of CCO, that did not perfuse the head and upper body ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 65 \%$ ). Thus, the descending aorta receives $59 \%+10 \%=69 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CCO}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 60 \%\right)$, the overwhelming majority of which ( $50 \%$ of CCO) perfuses the placenta. While the blood is in the placenta, $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rises from $60 \%$ to $85 \%$.

# N57-5 Embryology of the Atrial Septum 

## Contributed by George Lister

Our understanding of atrial embryology informs us about fetal cardiac physiology. The atrial septum primum grows from superior to inferior to partition the atria into right and left. Before this septation is complete, small holes (foramina) develop in the midportion of the septum primum and begin to coalesce, creating an oval hole known as the foramen ovale. As this occurs, the atrial septum secundum begins to grow from superior to inferior and just to the right of the septum primum. Like a window shade, it grows down to cover the foramen ovale, but it does not grow completely to the center crux of the heart. As a result, and because the pressure in the right atrium minimally exceeds that in the left atrium in utero, the septum primum (the inferior portion of the atrial septum) is pushed away from the septum secundum and toward the left atrium, creating a "defect" in the atrial tissue that allows blood in the right atrium to move into the left atrium through the open foramen.

## CARDIOPULMONARY ADJUSTMENTS AT BIRTH

As the newborn exits the birth canal, it takes its first breath, which not only expands the lungs but also triggers a series of changes in the circulatory system. At the same time, the newborn loses its nutritional connection to the mother and confronts a cold new world. Three major challenges to metabolism accompany birth: hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia. We discuss the adaptations of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems in this subchapter, and adjustments of other organ systems in the next.

## Loss of the placental circulation requires the newborn to breathe on its own

Although separation of the placenta does not occur until several minutes after birth, vasoconstriction in the umbilical arteries terminates the ability of the placenta to deliver oxygenated blood to the newborn immediately upon birth. Thus, even though the newborn may remain attached to its placenta during the first few moments of life, it is essential that the baby begin to breathe immediately. Umbilical vasoconstriction has two origins. First, the stretching of the umbilical arteries during delivery stimulates them to constrict. Second, the sudden rise in the systemic arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the newborn also stimulates and maintains vasoconstriction in the umbilical arteries. Birth may also be associated with an "autotransfusion" as blood in the placental circulation preferentially moves into the body of the emerging baby. Because the umbilical veins do not constrict as do the umbilical arteries, blood flows from placenta to newborn if the infant is held below the level of the placenta, and if the umbilical cord is not clamped. This autotransfusion may constitute 75 to 100 mL , which is a substantial fraction of the newborn's total blood volume of $\sim 300 \mathrm{~mL}$ $(90 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg})$.

At birth, the newborn must transform its circulatory system from one that supports gas exchange in the placenta to one that supports $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ exchange in the lungs. In addition, other circulatory adjustments must occur as the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidneys assume their normal roles. As the lungs become functional at birth, the pulmonary and systemic circulations shift from interconnected and parallel systems to separate entities that function in series.

## Mild hypoxia and hypercapnia, as well as tactile stimuli and cold skin, trigger the first breath

The first breath is the defining event for the newborn. Not only does it inflate the lungs, but also-as discussed belowit triggers circulatory changes that convert the fetal pattern of blood flow to the adult pattern. The functional capabilities of the lungs depend on the surface area available for gas exchange, the ability of surfactant to maximize lung compliance, neural mechanisms that control breathing and the aforementioned circulatory changes.

The first breath is normally also the most difficult inspiration of a lifetime. A considerable negative pressure within the intrapleural space is necessary to overcome the effects of surface tension (stage 1 in Fig. 27-4B). The infant's first
inspiratory effort requires a transpulmonary pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)$ the pressure difference between the intrapleural space and alveolar air spaces (see p. 608)-of $60 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to increase the lung volume by $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mL}$. In contrast, a typical adult only needs to change $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ by $\sim 2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ during a typical tidal volume of 500 mL (see Fig. 27-5). The newborn's first ventilatory effort creates an air-water interface for the first time, opening the alveoli. Breathing becomes far easier once the alveoli are open and the type II alveolar pneumocytes deliver surfactant to the air-water interface. Thus, the second inspiration may require a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ of only $40 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The newborn may not achieve the adult level of relative lung compliance until 1 hour after birth. Very immature neonates, who lack adequate surfactant (see Box 57-2), may have persistent difficulty expanding the lungs.

The rapid onset of breathing immediately after delivery appears to be induced by a temporary state of hypoxia and hypercapnia. In most normal deliveries, these changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ result from the partial occlusion of the umbilical cord. Tactile stimulation and decreased skin temperature also promote the onset of breathing. When newborns do not begin to breathe immediately, hypercapnia and hypoxia increase and provide further simulation for the infant to breathe.

The peripheral and central chemoreceptors (see pp. 709717) are responsible for sensing the blood-gas parameters (i.e., low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and low pH ), detecting asphyxia, and stimulating respiration. In addition, increased sympathetic tone may stimulate breathing at the time of birth by constricting vessels to the peripheral chemoreceptors (see pp. 711-712) and thereby lowering the local $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the microenvironment of the glomus cells and mimicking even more severe hypoxia. Finally, independent of the initial stimuli that trigger breathing, other central nervous system mechanisms may help to sustain breathing in the newborn. However, when asphyxia is severe, the changes in blood-gas concentrations may obtund rather than stimulate breathing, so that assisted ventilation and resuscitation are required.

The neonate's ability to control blood-gas parameters depends on the sensitivity of the lung's mechanical (i.e., stretch) reflexes, sensitivity of the central and peripheral chemoreceptors, gestational and postnatal age, ability of the respiratory muscles to resist fatigue, and effects of the sleep state. Variability in tidal volume (see p. 601) and timing of breathing as well as episodes of decreased arterial $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}(<90 \%)$ are common in healthy infants and are even more pronounced in premature infants. However, the variability decreases over the first few weeks, so that by $\sim 1$ month after normal term gestation (i.e., 44 weeks postconceptional age), periods with desaturation are rare, with no discernible differences between preterm and full-term infants.

Sleeping newborns, especially premature newborns, tend to have increased respiratory variability from breath to breath. For example, they exhibit periodic breathing, which consists of breaths with intermittent respiratory pauses (generally of a few to several seconds' duration) and varying tidal volumes. Periodic breathing and increased respiratory variability occur more frequently during rapid eye movement sleep than during quiet sleep, a state characterized by regular breathing, but the mechanisms underlying periodic breathing in the newborn remain unclear.

# N57-6 Apnea in the Newborn 

## Contributed by Gabriel Haddad

Apnea of prematurity or apnea in a full-term infant is defined in two ways:

1. Statistically: Based on the distribution of respiratory pauses in a population of infants. Using this definition, respiratory pauses $>20$ seconds in premature infants and $>30$ seconds in full-term infants during the first several months of life are too long to be normal and hence are termed apneas.
2. Physiologically: Based on the physiological consequences of respiratory pauses. For example, if a respiratory pause induces deleterious cardiovascular effects (e.g., bradycardia or cyanosis), that respiratory pause may also be termed apnea even if the duration of the apnea is $<20$ or 30 seconds as stated above. Hence, this latter definition is based on functional consequences and is therefore more clinically relevant.

A BLOOD FLOW EXPRESSED AS PERCENT OF COMBINED CARDIAC OUTPUT

Figure 57-3 Fetal circulation. A, This schematic drawing is based on data that show the major elements of the fetal circulation obtained from studies on intact fetal lambs, with catheters inserted to measure blood flow, pressure, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. The data serve as approximations for near-term human fetuses, for which comparable data are not obtainable. Note that, in the main drawing, the heart is upside down for the sake of presenting the blood flow as simply as possible. The heart is right side up in the inset. Because the inputs and outputs of the right and left hearts mix, we define the CCO as the sum of the outputs of the right and left ventricles. The percent of the CCO that passes various checkpoints is represented as a number in a dark gray box. Note that the CCOs of the right ventricle ( $66 \%$ ) and the left ventricle ( $34 \%$ ) add up to $100 \%$. The fetal circulation has four unique pathways: placenta, ductus venosus, foramen ovale, and ductus arteriosus. GI, gastrointestinal.

B OXYGEN SATURATION / $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$
![bo590346323f](bo590346323f.jpg)

Figure 57-3, cont'd B, This schematic drawing is the same as in $\mathbf{A}$ except that, at each checkpoint, we show the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of HbF against a black background and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (in mm Hg ) against a white background. The relationship between the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values is based on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation curve for HbF (similar to the curve labeled " $\mathrm{Hb}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ " in Fig. 29-7). The $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of blood at any point where two streams of blood merge is derived from the flow-weighted mixture of oxygen flows as follows: $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)_{\text {oxygen }}=[\text { flow } \times \mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}]_{\text {ocean }}+\text { flow } \times$ $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}]_{\text {ocean }}+\left[\text { flow }_{\text {ocean }}+\text { flow }_{\text {ocean } 0}\right]$. The resultant $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of that mixture is dictated by the $\mathrm{HbF}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, which shows the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ for any $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The numerical values in this figure are reasonable estimates for a healthy near-term fetus.

## At birth, removal of the placenta increases systemic vascular resistance, whereas lung expansion decreases pulmonary vascular resistance

As noted on pages 1157-1158, the fetal circulation has four unique pathways for blood flow absent in the adult: the placental circulation, ductus venosus, foramen ovale, and ductus arteriosus. In this and the next three sections, we discuss the closure of each of these four pathways.

At birth, blood flow to the placenta ceases when the umbilical vessels are ligated, and the shunts progressively disappear over the ensuing hours to days. In addition, the pulmonary circulation, which received only $\sim 7 \%$ of the CCO in the fetus, now accepts the entire cardiac output.

Removal of the Placental Circulation The placental circulation, which receives $\sim 50 \%$ of the CCO (see Fig. 57-3A), represents a major parallel path in the systemic circulation and accounts for the low vascular resistance of the fetal systemic circulation. When the placental circulation disappears at birth, the total peripheral resistance doubles. Because blood flow through the descending aorta is essentially unchanged, aortic and left ventricular systolic pressure must increase.

Increase in Pulmonary Blood Flow During fetal life, hypoxic vasoconstriction (see p. 687) markedly limits pulmonary blood flow and thereby diverts right ventricular flow through the ductus arteriosus. At birth, pulmonary vascular resistance abruptly decreases $>5$-fold with breathing (Fig. 57-4), owing to lung expansion, an increase in alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, a decrease in alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-each of which has discernible independent effects-and perhaps the release of $\mathrm{PGI}_{2}$ (or prostacyclin). As a result, blood flow through the pulmonary vasculature increases by $\sim 4$-fold at birth, whereas pulmonary arterial and right ventricular pressure fall abruptly. These pressures continue to decline over the ensuing few months because of a regression of the pulmonary arterial musculature, growth of new pulmonary vessels, and, to some extent, the decline in blood viscosity as hematocrit falls.

## Closure of the ductus venosus within the first days of life forces portal blood to perfuse the liver

Although blood flow through the umbilical vein ceases soon after birth, the majority of the portal blood continues to flow through the ductus venosus. Thus, immediately after birth, portal flow through the liver remains low. However, within a few days after term birth (longer after preterm birth), constriction of the vascular smooth muscle within the ductus venosus causes functional closure of this shunt pathway. As a result, pressure in the portal vein increases markedly, thereby diverting blood into the liver. The mechanisms underlying the contraction of the muscular walls of the ductus venosus remain unknown.

## Closure of the foramen ovale occurs as left atrial pressure begins to exceed right atrial pressure

After birth, the decrease in the pulmonary vascular resistance permits increased blood flow through the lungs, which
![bo600346323f](bo600346323f.jpg)

Figure 57-4 Effect of birth on pulmonary vascular resistance, blood flow, and mean arterial pressure. In the fetus, pulmonary vascular resistance is high, pulmonary blood flow is low, and mean pulmonary arterial pressure is high. At birth, each of these three situations rapidly reverses. The primary event is the fall in resistance, which occurs because (1) the pulmonary blood vessels are no longer being crushed; (2) breathing causes an increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which in turn causes vasodilation; and (3) local prostaglandins cause vasodilation. The reason that pressure falls after birth is that the fall in pulmonary vascular resistance is greater than the rise in blood flow. (Data from Rudolph AM: Congenital Diseases of the Heart: Clinical-Physiological Considerations. Armonk NY, Futura, 2001.)
increases venous return to the left atrium and elevates left atrial pressure. At the same time, the increase in pulmonary blood flow, the closing of the ductus arteriosus, and the increase in systemic resistance (due to removal of the placenta) conspire to decrease blood flow down the descending aorta and thus the venous return to the right atrium. As a result, right atrial pressure falls. The net effect of the rise in left atrial pressure and the fall in right atrial pressure is a reversal of the pressure gradient across the atrial septum that pushes a flap of tissue-which previously protruded into the left atrium-back against the septum, functionally closing the foramen ovale (Fig. 57-5A). Closing the foramen usually prevents flow of blood from the left to the right atrium of the newborn.

The separation between the atria often becomes permanent as additional tissue grows over the foramen ovale in a few months. However, in some infants, the two flaps of atrial septal tissue that overlie the foramen (1) NS7-5 do not completely adhere, so that a potential remnant pathway is left between the two atria. About $15 \%$ to $25 \%$ of adults still have a patent foramen ovale that can permit blood to flow from the right to the left atrium if right atrial pressure exceeds left

![bo610346323f](bo610346323f.jpg)

Figure 57-5 Changes in the circulation at and around birth. A, The closure of the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus establish separate right and left circulatory systems. As the pressure in the left atrium rises above the pressure in the right atrium-due to the large decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance-the flap of the foramen ovale pushes against the septum, preventing blood flow from the left to the right atrium. Eventually this flap seals shut. As aortic pressure exceeds the pressure of the pulmonary artery, blood flow through the ductus arteriosus reverses. Well-oxygenated aortic blood now flows through the ductus arteriosus. This high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ causes vasoconstriction, which functionally closes the ductus arteriosus within a few hours. Falling prostaglandin levels also contribute to the rapid closure. Eventually, the lumen of the ductus becomes anatomically obliterated. B, The elimination of the fetal shunts and the oxygenation of blood in the lungs lead to major increases in the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the circulation.
atrial pressure. Such a right-to-left shunt can occur pathologically in pulmonary hypertension or physiologically following heavy weightlifting. The shunt can also create a path by which a thrombus that develops in the systemic venous circulation can bypass the lungs and travel right to left into the systemic arterial circulation-a well-recognized mechanism for stroke in susceptible adults.

## Closure of the ductus arteriosus completes the separation between the pulmonary and systemic circulations

Immediately after birth, the ductus arteriosus remains open but blood flow, which follows the path of least resistance, now begins to shunt (left to right) from the descending aorta to the pulmonary circulation because of the two events that change the relationship between pulmonary and systemic vascular resistance: (1) increased systemic resistance because of the removal of the placenta, and (2) decreased pulmonary resistance because of the expansion of the lungs.

Within a few hours after term birth, the ductus arteriosus closes functionally because its muscular wall constricts (see Fig. 57-5A). Usually, all blood flow through the ductus arteriosus ceases within 1 week after birth. Within a month or so, the lumen becomes obliterated anatomically because of
thrombosis (i.e., blood clot within the lumen), intimal thickening, and loss of smooth-muscle cells.

The relatively rapid functional closure of the ductus arteriosus after birth is primarily the result of an increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the arterial blood (caused by breathing) that perfuses this vessel, a decrease in circulating $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (caused by placenta removal and increased pulmonary $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ uptake), and a decrease in $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ receptors in the ductus wall. As the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of blood flowing through the ductus arteriosus rises from 18 to 22 mm Hg in utero to $\sim 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ a few hours after birth, the smooth muscle in the wall of the ductus arteriosus contracts, which reduces or eliminates flow through the ductus. This contraction also constricts the vasa vasorum of the ductus, contributing to smooth-muscle apoptosis in the vessel wall. It is quite common, however, for the ductus arteriosus to remain patent in preterm infants, especially those who are most premature, and occasionally in the full-term infant. A patent ductus arteriosus allows a left-to-right shunt of blood from the aorta to the pulmonary artery because the aorta has a higher pressure. In the premature infant, reduced $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ sensitivity and less smooth muscle contribute to prolonged patency. If the shunt is large, it has significant hemodynamic consequences because of the excess flow to the lungs and reduced flow to systemic organs. In such cases, administration of a cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor (see

Box 3-3) such as indomethacin (which decreases levels of the vasodilator $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$; see p. 1158) or surgical ligation can close the ductus. In some newborns with congenital cardiac defects that block or severely decrease pulmonary blood flow, the ductus arteriosus may be the only route for getting blood to the lungs for gas exchange (Box 57-4).

The closure of the ductus arteriosus completes the separation of the right and left circulations initiated with closure of the foramen ovale. Whereas the ventricles functioned in parallel in the fetus, now they function in series in the

## BOX 57-4 Congenital Cardiac Disease

Cardiac malformations are the most common significant congenital defects ( 7 in 1000 live births). Many of the most severe defects still permit normal growth in utero but become life threatening when the infant is born. Despite progress in elucidating the genetic basis for these malformations, treatment of infants still relies on early diagnosis and medical and surgical management. Application of the findings of basic laboratory studies has contributed to dramatic reversal of prognosis for malformations that were nearly universally fatal 50 years ago. Of those severe cardiac defects, some produce complete or nearly complete obstruction of blood flow from the right ventricle to the lungs (e.g., pulmonic valve atresia or severe pulmonary valve stenosis) and some cause obstruction of blood flow from the left ventricle to the systemic tissues (e.g., aortic valve atresia, severe aortic valve stenosis, or severe narrowing of the aortic arch).

The infants with obstruction to pulmonary blood flow experience extreme hypoxemia unless the ductus arteriosus remains sufficiently patent to permit blood from the aorta to flow to the lungs and exchange oxygen. For those infants, infusion of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ (to dilate the ductus) has become a life-saving therapy that permits adequate blood flow to the lungs and maintenance of a stable circulation for days until the valve is opened or bypassed in a surgical procedure. Indeed, the first major cardiac surgery in an infant was performed on a "blue baby" to create a connection (shunt) from the subclavian artery to the pulmonary artery-the Blalock-Taussig shunt-in 1944.

Infants with obstruction to systemic blood flow frequently present in circulatory shock with severe metabolic acidosis. When the ductus arteriosus is patent, blood flow can travel from the pulmonary artery to the aorta and perfuse the upper body (with retrograde flow) and the lower body. However, when the ductus narrows or closes as it usually does soon after birth, the situation becomes life threatening. Again, infusion of $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ can nearly instantly improve systemic perfusion and ameliorate the shock-like state unless there has already been sustained damage to organs from inadequate circulation. Surgical management of some lesions-such as coarctation (narrowing) of the aorta-can result in a normal or near-normal life.

Other lesions-such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, which includes aortic and mitral valve atresia and only a single right ventricle that is functional-present a much more complex surgical problem that require either a stagedmanagement approach or even heart transplantation.
neonate. As a result, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of the newborn's Hb is similar to that of the adult's (see Fig. 57-5B). Although intrapulmonary shunting and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{B}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch cause the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Fe}}$ in the infant to be lower than that in the adult, the leftward shift of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation curve of HbF (see p. 654) allows the newborn to achieve the same $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation as an adult. In the neonate, the sum of the ventricular outputs of the two ventricles (i.e., twice the cardiac output) is larger than the CCO in the fetus, a result primarily of a marked rise in the output of the left ventricle, which doubles its stroke volume. Compared with the adult, the newborn has a markedly lower systemic vascular resistance and thus can achieve a relatively high blood flow with a relatively low perfusion pressure (see Box 57-4).

## NEONATAL PHYSIOLOGY

In humans, the neonatal period is defined as the first 4 weeks after birth. The newborn's ability to survive during this period depends on the adequate development and maturation of various fetal organ systems, adaptations of these organ systems to extrauterine life, and nurturing by a mother or other caretaker because of the neonate's extreme dependence. As the newborn loses its nutritional link with the placenta, the infant must now rely on its own gastrointestinal tract. Moreover, other functions normally carried out by the placenta are now entrusted to the liver and kidneys. Finally, on exiting its uterine "incubator," the newborn must stabilize body temperature.

Although the newborn is prone to hypothermia, nonshivering thermogenesis in brown fat helps to keep the neonate warm

The body loses heat to the environment by radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation (see pp. 1196-1197). The relative importance of these processes depends on the circumstances. For instance, at birth the infant moves from a warm and liquid environment to cool and dry surroundings. Hence, evaporation is the main source of heat loss at delivery, and then when the newborn's skin is dry, body heat is lost primarily by other means. The newborn is particularly susceptible to thermal stress, owing to some important predisposing factors: (1) large skin surface area relative to small body mass (or volume), and particularly the large surface area and high blood flow of the head; (2) limited ability to generate heat via shivering thermogenesis; (3) poor thermal insulation from the environment by adipose tissue; and (4) lack of behavioral adjustments, such as changing clothing or moving to a more favorable environment (see pp. 1223-1225).

Despite these factors, the newborn has important mechanisms for resisting hypothermia, including vasomotor responses, which divert warmed blood to or from the skin surface, and nonshivering thermogenesis, a process that occurs primarily in liver, brain, and brown fat (Fig. 57-6). Cold stress triggers an increase in the levels of TSH and

![bo620346323f](bo620346323f.jpg)

epinephrine. TSH stimulates the release of the thyroid hormones, predominantly $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ (see p. 1006). Working in parallel, epinephrine activates, particularly in brown fat, the $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-monodeiodinase responsible for the peripheral conversion of circulating $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ to the far more active triiodothyronine ( $\mathrm{T}_{3}$; see pp. 1009-1010). $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ acts locally in brown fat to uncouple mitochondrial oxidation from phosphorylation and thereby to increase heat production.

Brown fat differs from white fat in having a high density of mitochondria; the cytochromes in these mitochondria give the brown fat cells their color. Newborns have particularly high levels of brown fat in the neck and midline of the upper back. In brown fat, the locally generated $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ upregulates a protein called uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1; originally known as thermogenin). This protein is an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$channel located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Normally, intracellular purine nucleotides (e.g., ATP, GDP) inhibit UCP1. However, epinephrine, acting via a cAMP pathway, activates the lipase that liberates FAs from triacylglycerols. These FAs relieve the inhibition of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$channel and increase its conduction of protons. Consequently, the protons generated by electron transport enter the mitochondrion via UCP1, which dissipates the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$gradient needed by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ translocating ATP synthase (see p. 118). Thus, the mitochondria in brown fat can produce heat without producing useful energy in the form of ATP. The oxidation of FAs in brown fat generates $\sim 27 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ of body weight each day, contributing a large fraction of the neonate's high metabolic rate per mass.

## The neonate mobilizes glucose and FAs soon after delivery

Carbohydrate Metabolism Elimination of the placental circulation at birth means that the newborn now has to ingest and digest its own food. However, the newborn may not start suckling for $\sim 6$ hours. During late fetal life, glucocorticoids promote rapid accumulation of glycogen via their action on glycogen synthase. In its first few hours, the neonate uses glycogenolysis to mobilize hepatic glycogen stores and thereby release glucose into the bloodstream. The two enzymes needed for breaking down hepatic glycogen, phosphorylase and glucose 6-phosphatase (see p. 1182), are present in the fetus but do not become active until soon after birth.

The newborn depletes hepatic glycogen stores in the first 12 hours of life and is susceptible to hypoglycemia if feeding is delayed. Stores of glycogen in cardiac muscle are 10 times those in the adult, and those in the skeletal muscle are 3 to 5 times those in the adult, but the fetus mainly uses the glycogen stored in these tissues to provide glucose for local use. The net effect is that during the first day of life, blood glucose levels may decline to 40 to $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$, although they soon rise to near adult values once nutrition becomes adequate.

Infants born to diabetic mothers run a very high risk of having severe hypoglycemia (i.e., $<40 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). The high maternal blood glucose levels translate to high fetal blood glucose levels, causing hyperplasia of $\beta$ cells in the fetal pancreatic islets and hyperinsulinism in the fetus. Insulin levels remain high after birth, which produces extreme
symptomatic hypoglycemia. Blood glucose levels tend to reach their low point within a few hours after birth and begin to recover spontaneously within 6 hours.

Even in the normal newborn, low levels of blood glucose in the immediately postnatal period lead to a decrease in blood levels of insulin (see pp. 1035-1050) and a reciprocal increase of glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053). This hormonal milieu promotes the net release of glucose by the liver. In the liver, glucagon acts via cAMP to stimulate glycogenolysis, inhibit glycogen synthesis, stimulate gluconeogenesis, and initiate synthesis of some gluconeogenic enzymes. All these actions promote formation of glucose for release into the bloodstream (see Fig. 51-12). In contrast to the adult, in whom phosphorylation is the main mechanism for regulating the enzymes involved in glycogen metabolism, in the fetus, the relative concentration of the enzymes may be more important.

Epinephrine also promotes glucose mobilization (see Fig. 58-9) in the immediately postnatal period, and it uses the same cAMP pathway as glucagon. Hypoxia, hypoglycemia, and hypothermia all stimulate the release of epinephrine from the adrenal medulla.

Fat Metabolism During the final 2 months of gestation, the fetus stores $\sim 500 \mathrm{~g}$ of fat (i.e., $\sim 15 \%$ of body weight), an important source of energy for the neonate. Decreased blood glucose just after birth raises levels of glucagon and epinephrine, which stimulate hormone-sensitive lipase in adipose tissue via cAMP (see p. 1182). This lipase breaks down triacylglycerols into glycerol and FAs, which enter the bloodstream. The liver can take up glycerol and ultimately synthesize glucose (i.e., gluconeogenesis). (5) NS7-? The liver can also take up FAs and generate ketone bodies, which are important as the newborn deals with glycogen depletion.

Metabolic Rate The neonate's metabolic rate-expressed per kilogram of body weight-is much higher than that of the adult. Through the first year of life, the growing infant has a daily resting metabolic rate of $\sim 55 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$, which is nearly double the value of $\sim 30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ for a healthy young adult. At birth, the growing infant has a daily caloric requirement of 100 to $120 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$, which will fall to 90 to $100 \mathrm{kcal} /$ kg by the end of the first year. The difference between the caloric requirement and resting metabolic rate represents the calories expended in physical activity and growth.

## Breast milk from a mother with a balanced diet satisfies all of the infant's nutritional requirements during the first several months of life

Provided the mother's diet is adequate during pregnancy, the newborn is in complete nutritional balance at birth. The newborn's natural nutrition for the first few days of life is colostrum (a milk-like substance secreted by the mammary glands), and thereafter it is breast milk (see Table 56-7 for the composition of these substances), both of which the newborn's gastrointestinal tract can readily digest. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months, and then breast-feeding complemented with consumption of other foods until at least 1 year

# N57-7 Gluconeogenesis with Glycerol as the Starting Material 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As noted in the text, hepatocytes can take up glycerol and use it in gluconeogenesis. As outlined in Fig. 58-6B, after taking up glycerol, hepatocytes can use a three-step process to convert glycerol (highlighted by a rose-colored background in the left limb of the figure) to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate. The first step is to use glycerol kinase to convert glycerol and ATP to L-glycerol-3phosphate and ADP. The second step is to use glycerol-3phosphate dehydrogenase (plus oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide $\left[\mathrm{NAD}^{+}\right]$) to oxidize L-glycerol-3-phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate (plus reduced NAD [NADH] + H). The third step is to use triose phosphate isomerase to isomerize the dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate.

Hepatocytes can use the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate to generate glucose. The first step is to use aldolase to combine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone phosphate
(generated in the second step of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate) to generate fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. The second step is to bypass the phosphofructokinase reaction of glycolysis by using fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase to generate fructose-6-phosphate. The third step is to use phosphoglucoisomerase to isomerize the fructose-6-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate. Finally, glucose-6-phosphatase in the endoplasmic reticulum bypasses the glucokinase reaction of glycolysis by converting glucose-6-phosphate to glucose. Glucagon stimulates production of both fructose-1,6bisphosphatase and glucose-6-phosphatase.

of age. If the infant is breast-fed, and if the mother's nutritional status is good, colostrum and breast milk meet all of the newborn's nutritional needs. Moreover, colostrum and breast milk make important contributions to the newborn's immune status. Both contain high concentrations of immunoglobulin A (or secretory) antibodies directed against bacteria and viruses, and they also contain macrophages. Breast milk contains factors that promote the growth of lactobacilli, which colonize the colon and may protect the infant from some virulent strains of Escherichia coli.

If the mother's dietary intake of iron is adequate during pregnancy, the infant's hepatic stores of iron will be adequate for hematopoiesis for 6 to 9 months following delivery.

The calcium in breast milk can meet the infant's needs for the rapid calcification of bones and teeth. Although the supply of calcium per se is unlikely to be a problem, vitamin D is necessary for the proper absorption of calcium by the intestines (see pp. 1065-1067). Vitamin D supplementation may be necessary if the newborn or the mother is not exposed to sufficient sunlight to generate vitamin D in the skin (see p. 1064). Supplementation may also be required in formula-fed infants and in infants born prematurely. Rickets (see Box 52-2) can develop rapidly in a vitamin D-deficient infant. 0 N57-8

## The neonate is at special risk of developing fluid and acid-base imbalances

The newborn normally loses $6 \%$ to $10 \%$ of body weight during the first week of life, which reflects a decrease in interstitial and intravascular volume. After $\sim 1$ week, the rate of fluid intake begins to exceed that rate of loss, and term infants return close to birth weight by $11 / 2$ weeks.

The newborn's total-body water is $\sim 75 \%$ of body weight compared with $60 \%$ for men and $50 \%$ for women (see Table $5-1$ ). Once the newborn is in a steady state, daily turnover of body water is 100 to $120 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{kg}$ (i.e., 3 - to 4 -fold higher than in adults). About one third of this fluid loss occurs via skin and respiration, whereas the other two thirds occurs via urine and stool. Large variations in newborn fluid loss may go undetected because of the environment, the neonate's large ratio of surface area to mass, and the inability to seek access to water. Thus, small changes in the balance between fluid intake and loss can lead to rapid and profound disturbances in body fluid compartments, which requires very careful management.

The immaturity of the neonate's kidneys further complicates matters. For example, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR; see p. 739), which is extremely low at birth, increases rapidly during the first 2 weeks of life. However, even when normalized for body surface area, GFR does not reach adult levels until $\sim 1$ year of age, in part because renal blood flow during that time increases from $\sim 5 \%$ to $20 \%$ of cardiac output. Moreover, the dehydrated newborn has limited capacity to conserve fluid because the concentrating ability of the kidney (i.e., a maximal urine osmolality of $\sim 450 \mathrm{mOsm}$ ) is substantially less than that of an adult ( $\sim 1200 \mathrm{mOsm}$ ). This difference reflects shorter loops of Henle and low urea concentrations in the medullary interstitium until the newborn ingests protein.

Because of the newborn's relatively high metabolic rate, the neonate generates a greater load of nonvolatile acids (see p. 821) than the adult. Moreover, the immature state of neonatal kidneys with respect to acid excretion puts the neonate at risk of developing metabolic acidosis (see p. 635).

## Humoral and cellular immune responses begin at early stages of development in the fetus

Maternal antibodies play a key role in protecting the infant from infection both in utero and during the first several months after birth.

Fetus The placenta actively transports the small immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies from mother to fetus, so that fetal IgG levels are even higher than those in the mother. These maternal IgG antibodies ward off infection by viruses and some bacteria. However, maternal IgA (which is primarily present in secretions), IgE, and IgM antibodies generally do not cross the placenta in appreciable amounts, and the baby is generally born with very low levels of these other immunoglobulins.

The fetus begins to develop its own immune capabilities at very early stages of development. However, because the fetus is isolated from antigens, the fetal immune system normally does not make large amounts of antibodies. Nevertheless, the fetus can respond to intrauterine infections by generating IgM antibodies. In addition, the fetus also begins to produce other proteins that help to protect against bacterial and viral infections. Among these are the following: (1) the components of the complement pathway; (2) lysozyme, an enzyme found in secretions such as tears and mucus, which digests the cell walls of bacteria and fungi; and (3) interferon- $\gamma$, which is produced by T lymphocytes and which activates B lymphocytes, macrophages, and endothelial cells.

Neonate Not only does the fetus have high prenatal levels of maternal IgG, but the newborn receives copious amounts of secretory IgA antibodies in colostrum and breast milk. However, the blood levels of maternal IgG antibodies progressively fall, and IgG levels in the infant's blood reach a nadir at $\sim 3$ months of age. After that time, the infant's own production of IgG antibodies causes total IgG levels to increase gradually. However, even at 1 year of age, IgG levels-as well as the levels of $\operatorname{IgA}, \operatorname{IgM}$, and $\operatorname{IgE}$-are only half of adult levels.

Antibodies obtained in utero from the mother protect the fetus against most childhood diseases, including diphtheria, measles, and poliomyelitis. The persistence of antibodies at levels high enough for protection varies considerably from one disease to another. For example, maternal measles antibodies are so persistent that vaccinations against measles often fail if attempted before the infant is 15 months of age. In contrast, maternal antibodies against whooping cough (pertussis) are generally inadequate to protect the infant beyond 1 to 2 months. The infant normally receives a first DTaP immunization (diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis), as well as a first poliomyelitis immunization, at 2 months of age.

# N57-8 Scurvy in Infants 

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

Vitamin C (ascorbic acid; see Table 45-3) is necessary for the synthesis of hydroxyproline in collagen and chondroitin sulfate in cartilage, bone, and other connective tissues. The neonate is normally born with sufficient stores of vitamin C and receives adequate amounts of this vitamin in breast milk. If the breast milk or formula is vitamin C deficient, the infant may develop scurvy, which can be prevented by administering vitamin C supplements to the mother or infant. Scurvy is a disease manifest by lesions on the skin and mucous membranes.

## In premature newborns, immaturity of organ systems and fragility of homeostatic mechanisms exacerbate postnatal risks

The World Health Organization defines a premature infant as one born sooner than 37 weeks after the mother's last menstrual period, compared with the normal 40 weeks (see p. 1142). Virtually all the challenges to the health of the neonate are made more severe by prematurity or intrauterine growth restriction (see Box 57-1), conditions that are
therefore associated with reduced chances of survival. These problems generally reflect immaturity either of certain organ systems (e.g., lungs, intestines, liver, kidneys) or of homeostatic mechanisms (e.g., thermoregulation). (○) NS7-9

## Contributed by Ervin Jones

## Blood Plasma Parameters

Because both the respiratory and the renal systems regulate blood pH (see Equation 28-27), variations in one or both of these systems can lead to substantial fluctuations in blood pH in the premature infant. In addition, prematurity is often associated with hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, hyperbilirubinemia, and hypoproteinemia (reflecting an immature liver).

## Respiration

Large numbers of mature alveoli begin to appear only relatively late in gestation (see p. 1156). Similarly, the type II alveolar pneumocytes begin to produce substantial amounts of surfactant only just before the normal term of gestation. As a result, premature infants have a reduced vital capacity and functional residual capacity. The greater the degree of prematurity, the greater the incidence of-and mortality from-infant respiratory distress syndrome (see Box 57-2). In addition to having these problems with pulmonary mechanics, premature newborns are also prone to difficulties with ventilatory control. For example, infants with a birth weight of $<1500 \mathrm{~g}$ have a high incidence of recurrent apnea (i.e., cessation of breathing for $>20$ seconds, or long enough to produce either cyanosis or bradycardia; see Fig. 23-6A for the mechanism by which hypoxia can produce bradycardia).

## Gastrointestinal Function

Prematurity predisposes the newborn to necrotizing enterocolitis, in which intestinal ischemia leads to the inflammation and death of the mucosa or even the entire intestinal wall. Stresses such as asphyxia or hypothermia may trigger this condition. In addition, the digestive and absorptive systems-especially for lipids-may be inadequate in the premature infant. Because vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin required for the absorption of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see discussion beginning on page 1065), premature infants are at special risk of developing rickets.

## Liver

The immature infant is born with inadequate stores of hepatic glycogen, stores that are essential for maintaining adequate
plasma glucose levels in the first hours of extrauterine life. Inadequate hepatic synthesis of coagulation factors (see Table 18-4) can increase the risk of hemorrhage.

## Kidneys

Immaturity leads to across-the-board impairment of renal function. Renal blood flow, GFR, and tubular function are all affected. Impaired concentrating ability leads to high urinary water losses. In addition, low gestational age is associated with high levels of insensible water loss because the skin is thin, the subcutaneous tissue is inadequate, and the surface-to-volume ratio is so large. Thus, fluid balance is a major problem for the premature infant. The premature infant is also at a greater risk than the term infant for developing acidosis.

## Hematopoiesis

The premature infant is at increased risk of anemia. The baby born at term has a relatively high Hb concentration ( 14 to $20 \mathrm{~g} /$ dL ) and hematocrit ( $43 \%$ to $63 \%$ ). The Hb level normally falls slowly during the first few months of life due to a decreased rate of hematopoiesis and then rises gradually during childhood. The nadir in Hb concentration is more marked in the premature infant for two reasons. First, the premature infant is born with approximately $2 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ less Hb than its term counterpart. Second, it has a reduced hematopoietic capacity, due at least in part to decreased iron stores.

## Body Temperature

Premature newborns have difficulty maintaining an adequate temperature, so that body temperature tends to approach the ambient temperature. In a relatively cool room, the body temperature of a premature infant can fall to $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For this reason, a pediatrician treating a premature newborn places it in an incubator, which provides a neutral thermal environment (see p. 1196) and keeps the infant's body core temperature (see pp. 1193-1194) near $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The more immature the newborn (i.e., the smaller the body and the higher the surface-to-volume ratio), the higher must be the temperature of the incubator to maintain the proper body core temperature in the infant.

# METABOLISM 

Gerald I. Shulman and Kitt Falk Petersen

Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions in the body's cells, necessary to sustain life. These chemical processes allow the body to grow, reproduce, maintain structure, and respond to changes in its environment. These processes can be anabolic, in which energy is used in the formation of substances such as proteins or nucleic acids, or catabolic, in which organic substances are broken down during cellular respiration to harvest energy to support cellular processes such as biosynthesis, transport of molecules or ions across cell membranes, or locomotion. A healthy, sedentary young man weighing 70 kg requires $2100 \mathrm{kcal}(\sim 30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) (1) N58-1 to sustain resting metabolism for 1 day, an amount known as the resting metabolic rate (RMR). The number of calories increases with increased activity, illness, or other stress. For example, the metabolic rate can rise 2- to 3 -fold with exposure to a cold environment, or up to 10 -fold during heavy exercise. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a clinical term for metabolism that is measured under standardized conditions in which the subject (1) has had a full night of restful sleep, (2) has been fasting for 12 hours, (3) is in a neutral thermal environment (see p. 1196), (4) has been resting physically for 1 hour, and (5) is free of psychic and physical stimuli. In adults the BMR (units: kilocalories per hour and per square meter of body surface area) is $\sim 5 \%$ higher for males than for females and falls with age. The BMR is less than the RMR.

Regulation of energy metabolism in humans involves a complex interplay among ingested nutrients, hormones, and interorgan exchanges of substrates to maintain a constant and adequate supply of fuel for all organs of the body. Because energy acquisition by the body is intermittent, whereas energy expenditure is continuous, the body needs to store and then parcel out energy in a carefully coordinated fashion. Insulin (see pp. 1035-1050) is the key hormone that orchestrates this exchange and distribution of substrates between tissues under fed and fasting conditions. Glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053), catecholamines (see pp. 1030-1031), cortisol (see pp. 10181026), and growth hormone (see pp. 990-995) play major roles in energy regulation at times of acute energy needs, which occur during exercise, under conditions of stress, or in response to hypoglycemia. The major organs involved in fuel homeostasis are (1) the liver, which is normally the major producer of glucose; (1) N58-2 (2) the brain, which in the fasted state is the major utilizer of glucose; and (3) the muscle and adipose tissue, which respond to insulin and store energy in the form of glycogen and fat, respectively.

The purpose of this chapter is to review how humans utilize energy and the means by which the body manages its energy stores during times of feeding, fasting, and exercise.

## FORMS OF ENERGY

Virtually all energy that sustains humans derives, directly or indirectly, from breaking and releasing the energy stored in carbon-carbon bonds that were created in plants during photosynthesis. Cellulose, the principal form of this stored energy in the biosphere, consists of polymers of glucose joined by $\beta-1,4$ linkages that humans cannot digest (see pp. 914-915). However, ruminants can degrade cellulose to glucose because they have cellulase-producing bacteria in their digestive tracts. Humans obtain their energy from food in three forms: (1) carbohydrates, (2) proteins, and (3) lipids. Moreover, each form consists of building blocks: monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose) for carbohydrates, amino acids for proteins, and fatty acids for lipids.

Carbohydrates, which exist in the body mainly in the form of glucose, contain $4.1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of energy. The major storage form is glycogen, a polymer of glucose ( $10^{9}$ to $10^{9}$ $\mathrm{Da})$ that consists of glucose molecules linked together by $\alpha-1,4$ linkages in the straight portions of the polymer (Fig. 58-1) and by $\alpha-1,6$ linkages at the frequent branch points (see Fig. 45-3). Virtually all cells of the body store glycogen; the highest concentrations occur in liver and muscle. Cells store glycogen in cytoplasmic granules that also contain the enzymes needed for glycogen synthesis and degradation. Glycogen is highly hydrophilic, containing 1 to 2 g of water per gram of glycogen, and thus provides a handy storage depot for glucose without affecting the osmotic pressure of the intracellular space. However, this packaging of glycogen with water makes glycogen a relatively inefficient means of storing energy because it yields only 1 to 2 kcal for each gram of hydrated glycogen instead of the theoretical $4.1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of dry carbohydrate. In contrast to the other potential stored forms of energy (lipid and protein), the liver can quickly break down glycogen by glycogenolysis to provide glucose for the brain during hypoglycemia. Similarly, muscle can quickly break down glycogen to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to provide the energy necessary to run a high-intensity anaerobic sprint.
