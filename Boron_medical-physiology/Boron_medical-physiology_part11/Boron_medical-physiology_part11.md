# METABOLISM 

Gerald I. Shulman and Kitt Falk Petersen

Metabolism encompasses all chemical reactions in the body's cells, necessary to sustain life. These chemical processes allow the body to grow, reproduce, maintain structure, and respond to changes in its environment. These processes can be anabolic, in which energy is used in the formation of substances such as proteins or nucleic acids, or catabolic, in which organic substances are broken down during cellular respiration to harvest energy to support cellular processes such as biosynthesis, transport of molecules or ions across cell membranes, or locomotion. A healthy, sedentary young man weighing 70 kg requires $2100 \mathrm{kcal}(\sim 30 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{kg}$ body weight) (1) N58-1 to sustain resting metabolism for 1 day, an amount known as the resting metabolic rate (RMR). The number of calories increases with increased activity, illness, or other stress. For example, the metabolic rate can rise 2- to 3 -fold with exposure to a cold environment, or up to 10 -fold during heavy exercise. The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is a clinical term for metabolism that is measured under standardized conditions in which the subject (1) has had a full night of restful sleep, (2) has been fasting for 12 hours, (3) is in a neutral thermal environment (see p. 1196), (4) has been resting physically for 1 hour, and (5) is free of psychic and physical stimuli. In adults the BMR (units: kilocalories per hour and per square meter of body surface area) is $\sim 5 \%$ higher for males than for females and falls with age. The BMR is less than the RMR.

Regulation of energy metabolism in humans involves a complex interplay among ingested nutrients, hormones, and interorgan exchanges of substrates to maintain a constant and adequate supply of fuel for all organs of the body. Because energy acquisition by the body is intermittent, whereas energy expenditure is continuous, the body needs to store and then parcel out energy in a carefully coordinated fashion. Insulin (see pp. 1035-1050) is the key hormone that orchestrates this exchange and distribution of substrates between tissues under fed and fasting conditions. Glucagon (see pp. 1050-1053), catecholamines (see pp. 1030-1031), cortisol (see pp. 10181026), and growth hormone (see pp. 990-995) play major roles in energy regulation at times of acute energy needs, which occur during exercise, under conditions of stress, or in response to hypoglycemia. The major organs involved in fuel homeostasis are (1) the liver, which is normally the major producer of glucose; (1) N58-2 (2) the brain, which in the fasted state is the major utilizer of glucose; and (3) the muscle and adipose tissue, which respond to insulin and store energy in the form of glycogen and fat, respectively.

The purpose of this chapter is to review how humans utilize energy and the means by which the body manages its energy stores during times of feeding, fasting, and exercise.

## FORMS OF ENERGY

Virtually all energy that sustains humans derives, directly or indirectly, from breaking and releasing the energy stored in carbon-carbon bonds that were created in plants during photosynthesis. Cellulose, the principal form of this stored energy in the biosphere, consists of polymers of glucose joined by $\beta-1,4$ linkages that humans cannot digest (see pp. 914-915). However, ruminants can degrade cellulose to glucose because they have cellulase-producing bacteria in their digestive tracts. Humans obtain their energy from food in three forms: (1) carbohydrates, (2) proteins, and (3) lipids. Moreover, each form consists of building blocks: monosaccharides (glucose, fructose, and galactose) for carbohydrates, amino acids for proteins, and fatty acids for lipids.

Carbohydrates, which exist in the body mainly in the form of glucose, contain $4.1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of energy. The major storage form is glycogen, a polymer of glucose ( $10^{9}$ to $10^{9}$ $\mathrm{Da})$ that consists of glucose molecules linked together by $\alpha-1,4$ linkages in the straight portions of the polymer (Fig. 58-1) and by $\alpha-1,6$ linkages at the frequent branch points (see Fig. 45-3). Virtually all cells of the body store glycogen; the highest concentrations occur in liver and muscle. Cells store glycogen in cytoplasmic granules that also contain the enzymes needed for glycogen synthesis and degradation. Glycogen is highly hydrophilic, containing 1 to 2 g of water per gram of glycogen, and thus provides a handy storage depot for glucose without affecting the osmotic pressure of the intracellular space. However, this packaging of glycogen with water makes glycogen a relatively inefficient means of storing energy because it yields only 1 to 2 kcal for each gram of hydrated glycogen instead of the theoretical $4.1 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of dry carbohydrate. In contrast to the other potential stored forms of energy (lipid and protein), the liver can quickly break down glycogen by glycogenolysis to provide glucose for the brain during hypoglycemia. Similarly, muscle can quickly break down glycogen to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) to provide the energy necessary to run a high-intensity anaerobic sprint.

One gram of tissue from a small mammal has a higher resting metabolic rate (RMR; see p. 1170) than the same mass of tissue from a larger mammal (e.g., a human). By plotting heat production versus body weight for animals over a range of five orders of magnitude, Max Kleiber showed that metabolic rate (in kcal/day) is not proportional to body weight (in kg ) but to body weight raised to the power $3 / 4$.

Allometry is the study of how body size relates to various biological parameters (e.g., metabolic rate, anatomic parameters).

Although the kidneys can also produce glucose by gluconeogenesis, their net contribution to whole-body glucose production is typically $<10 \%$ except under conditions of prolonged fasting, when they can contribute up to $30 \%$ to $40 \%$.

Figure 58-1 Glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis. After entering a liver or skeletal muscle cell, glucose is immediately phosphorylated to G6P, which can have three fates: glycolysis, breakdown via the pentose phosphate shunt, $\bigcirc$ N58-16 or glycogen synthesis. Glycogenolysis directly yields G1P and is thus not simply the reverse of glycogen synthesis. UDP, uridine diphosphate; UTP, uridine triphosphate.

| Glycogen | 0.7 | $1.5^{*}$ | 1,050 |

*Approximate energy density of hydrated glycogen.
*Because only half of this protein can be mobilized as a fuel source, the total yield is only $\sim 21,000 \mathrm{kcal}$.

The liver normally contains 75 to 100 g of glycogen but can store up to $120 \mathrm{~g}(8 \%$ of its weight) as glycogen. Muscle stores glycogen at much lower concentrations ( $1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of its weight). However, because of its larger mass, skeletal muscle has the largest store of glycogen in the body ( 300 to 400 g ). 0 N58-3 A typical $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human has up to $\sim 700 \mathrm{~g}$ of glycogen ( $\sim 1 \%$ of body weight). Thus, the total energy stored in the body in the form of glycogen can be nearly 3000 kcal (Table 58-1); this is still only a tiny fraction of that stored in the form of lipid, enough to supply resting metabolism for less than a day and a half, assuming 100\% efficiency. Nonetheless, carbohydrate stores are essential because certain tissues, particularly the brain, rely heavily on carbohydrates for their fuel. Whereas muscle contains the largest store of glycogen in the body, this pool of glycogen cannot contribute directly to blood glucose in response to hypoglycemia because muscles lack glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), which is necessary to convert G6P derived from glycogenolysis to glucose. Instead, the primary role of muscle glycogen is to supply energy locally for muscle contraction during intense exercise.

Proteins are linear polymers of L-amino acids (Fig. 58-2), which have the general molecular structure ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{~N}-\mathrm{HC}(\mathrm{R})$ COO ${ }^{-}$. Different functional R groups distinguish the 20 amino acids incorporated into nascent proteins during mRNA translation. In addition, four other amino acids are present in mature proteins: $\gamma$-carboxyglutamic acid, hydroxylysine, 4-hydroxyproline, and 3-hydroxyproline. However, these amino acids result from post-translational modification of amino acids that are already in the polypeptide chain. In $\alpha$-amino acids, the amino group $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}\right)$, the carboxyl group ( -COO ${ }^{-}$), and R all attach to the central or $\alpha$-carbon atom. In proteins, the amino acids are linked together by peptide bonds that join the $\alpha$-amino group of one amino acid with the $\alpha$-carboxyl group of another. Nine of the amino acids are termed essential amino acids (Table 58-2) because the body cannot synthesize them at rates sufficient to sustain growth and normal functions. Thus, we must obtain these amino acids in our diet.

Proteins contain $4.3 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$, about the same as carbohydrates. A typical $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human with $14 \%$ protein $(9.8 \mathrm{~kg})$ only about half of which is available as a fuel source-can thus store $\sim 21,000 \mathrm{kcal}$ (see Table 58-1) in the form of available protein-which could potentially provide $\sim 10$ days' worth of energy. Unlike carbohydrate, protein is not a primary energy reserve in humans. Instead, proteins serve other important structural and functional roles. Structural proteins make up skin, collagen, ligaments, and tendons. Functional proteins include enzymes that catalyze reactions,

## N58-16 The Pentose Phosphate Pathway (or Hexose Monophosphate Shunt)

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Figure 58-1 mentions that glucose-6-phosphate can have three major fates. The anabolic series of reactions summarized in this figure convert G6P to glycogen. The glycolytic pathway summarized in Figure 58-6A is a catabolic pathway that converts G6P to pyruvate. The third fate-the pentose phosphate pathway-is another catabolic series of reactions that converts G6P to ribose-5-phosphate.

The pentose phosphate pathway has two major products, NADPH and ribose-5-phosphate. The cell can use the reducing equivalents in NADPH (i.e., energy "currency") to reduce double bonds in the energy-consuming synthesis of FAs and steroids. These reactions are particularly important in such tissues as liver, adipose tissue, mammary gland, and adrenal cortex. Note that the cell cannot use NADH to create NADPH. Thus, the pentose phosphate pathway is critical. The second product of the pathway, ribose-5-phosphate, is important for the synthesis of ribonucleotides, which is particularly important in growing and regenerating tissues. The pentose phosphate pathway involves four reactions, the first and third of which involve the conversion of NADP ${ }^{+}$to NADPH and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

If the cell does not use the ribose-5-phosphate to generate ribonucleotides, the cell can use a complex series of reactions to convert the ribose-5-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. This sequence of reactions (i.e., from G6P to ribose-5-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate) bypasses or "shunts" the conversion of G6P to fructose-6-phosphate, which would otherwise be catalyzed by phosphoglucose isomerase (see Fig. 58-6A). For this reason, the pentose phosphate pathway is also called the hexose monophosphate shunt.*

However, the reader should be reassured that the shunt does not permit the cell to generate two NADPH molecules for free. Three G6P molecules ( $3 \times 6=18$ carbons) must traverse the hexose monophosphate shunt to generate six NADPH molecules $(3 \times 2=6)$ plus two fructose-6-phosphate ( $2 \times 6=12$ carbons) molecules, a single glyceraldehyde-3phosphate ( $1 \times 3=3$ carbons), and three $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules that arise from a decarboxylation reaction in the pentose phosphate pathway ( $3 \times 1=3$ carbons). If those three glucose molecules had gone through the classical glycolytic pathway, they would have generated $3 \times 2=6$ net ATPs and 6 NADHs (see Table 58-3). However, if those same three glucose molecules all go through the pentose phosphate pathway, the net result is only five ATPs, only five NADHs, but six NADPHs. Thus, the cell gives up only one ATP and one NADH for the sake of generating six NADPHs—not a bad deal for the cell!

## N58-3 Glycogen Supercompensation

## Contributed by Kitt Petersen and Gerald Shulman

Exercise induces an increase in GLUT4 expression in skeletal muscle, which leads to an increase in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and glycogen accumulation. The effect wears off -40 hours after exercise. Thus, after glycogen has been depleted by exercise, carbohydrate feeding results in enhanced glycogen accumulation, known as supercompensation. Under conditions of supercompensation (i.e., high-carbohydrate feeding following intense exercise), athletes can increase muscle glycogen content to up to $3 \%$ of body weight (rather than the usual $1 \%$ stated in the text).

If, after intense exercise, supercompensation of rats is prevented by feeding a carbohydrate-poor diet, the increase in GLUT4 expression is substantially prolonged (i.e., 66 versus only 40 hours following exercise).

muscle filaments such as myosin and actin, and various hormones. The body constantly breaks down proteins to amino acids, and vice versa, which allows cells to change their protein makeup as demands change. Thus, it is not surprising that protein catabolism makes only a small contributionmuch less than $5 \%$-to normal resting energy requirements. In contrast, during starvation, when carbohydrate reserves are exhausted, protein catabolism can contribute as much as $15 \%$ of the energy necessary to sustain the resting metabolic requirements by acting as major substrates for gluconeogenesis (see p. 1176).

In the healthy human adult who is eating a weightmaintaining diet, amino acids derived from ingested protein replenish those proteins that have been oxidized in normal daily protein turnover. Once these protein requirements have been met, the body first oxidizes excess protein to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and then converts the remainder to glycogen or triacylglycerols (TAGs).

Lipids are the most concentrated form of energy storage because they represent, on average, $9.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$. Lipids are dietary substances that are soluble in organic solvents but not in water and typically occur in the form of TAGs (Fig. 58-3A). The gastrointestinal (GI) tract breaks down ingested TAGs (see pp. 925-927) into fatty acids (FAs) and sn2monoacylglycerols (see Fig. 58-3B). FAs are composed of long carbon chains ( 14 to 24 carbon atoms) with a carboxyl terminus, and can be either saturated with hydrogen atoms or unsaturated (i.e., double bonds may connect one or more pairs of carbon atoms). When fully saturated, FAs have the general form $\mathrm{CH}_{2}-\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{n}-\mathrm{COOH}$ (see Fig. 58-3C).

In contrast to glycogen and protein, fat is stored in a nonaqueous environment and therefore yields energy very close to its theoretical $9.4 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ of TAGs. This greater efficiency of energy storage provided by fat is crucial for human

existence in that it allows for greater mobility and promotes survival during famine. Therefore, although humans have two large storage depots of potential energy (protein and fat), fat serves as the major expendable fuel source. Most of the body's fat depots exist in the subcutaneous adipose tissue layers, although fat also exists to a small extent in muscle and in visceral (deeper) depots in obese individuals. A typical $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human with $20 \%$ fat $(14 \mathrm{~kg})$ thus carries $131,600 \mathrm{kcal}$ of energy stored in adipose tissue (see Table 58-1). Assuming an RMR of $2100 \mathrm{kcal} /$ day and $100 \%$ efficiency of converting the fat to energy, mobilization and subsequent oxidation of this entire depot could theoretically sustain the body's entire resting metabolic requirement for several weeks.

## ENERGY BALANCE

## Energy input to the body is the sum of energy output and storage

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed; in a closed system, total energy is constant. This concept is illustrated in Figure 58-4. Humans acquire all of their energy from ingested food, store it in different forms, and expend it in different ways. In the steady state, energy intake must equal energy output.

The GI tract breaks down ingested carbohydrates (see pp. 914-915), proteins (see pp. 920-921), and lipids (see p. 925) into smaller components and then absorbs them into the bloodstream for transport to sites of metabolism. For

![bo04091984b7](bo04091984b7.jpg)
example, the GI tract reduces ingested carbohydrates to simple sugars (e.g., glucose, fructose), which are then transported to liver and muscle cells and either oxidized to release energy or converted to glycogen and fat for storage. Oxidation of fuels generates not only free energy but also waste products and heat (thermal energy).

The body's energy inputs must balance the sum of its energy outputs and the energy stored. When the body takes in more energy than it expends, the person is in positive energy balance and gains weight. In the case of adults, this gain is mostly in the form of fat. In healthy children during growth periods, this gain is mostly in the form of muscle, organ, and bone growth. Conversely, when energy intake is less than expenditure, this negative energy balance leads to weight loss, mostly from fat and, to a lesser extent, from protein in muscle.

A person can gain or lose weight by manipulating energy intake or output. An optimal strategy to encourage weight loss involves both increasing energy output and reducing energy intake. In most people, a substantial decrease in energy intake alone leads to inadequate nutrient intake, which can compromise bodily function.

Nitrogen balance-the algebraic sum of whole-body protein degradation and protein synthesis-is an indication of the change in whole-body protein stores. It is estimated from dietary protein intake and urinary nitrogen (i.e., urea) excretion. Children eating a balanced diet are in positive nitrogen balance because they store amino acids as protein in the process of growth. Patients who have suffered burns or trauma are usually in negative nitrogen balance because of the loss of lean (mostly muscle) body mass.

## The inefficiency of chemical reactions leads to loss of the energy available for metabolic processes

The second law of thermodynamics states that chemical transformations always result in a loss of the energy available to drive metabolic processes-the Gibbs free energy (G). The total internal energy ( E ) of the human body is the sum of the disposable or free energy ( G ) plus the unavailable or wasted energy, which ends up as heat (i.e., the product of absolute temperature, T , and entropy, S ):

$$
\mathrm{E}=\mathrm{G}+\mathrm{TS}
$$

For example when you ingest glucose, the total internal energy increases by a small amount ( $\Delta \mathrm{E}$ ). Some of this energy will be stored as glycogen $(\Delta \mathrm{G})$, and some will be wasted as heat ( $\mathrm{T} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{S}$ ). According to Equation 58-1, as long as the temperature is constant, the change in total internal energy will have two components:

$$
\frac{\Delta E}{\text { Energy of }}=\frac{\Delta G}{\text { Ingested glucose }} \quad \begin{gathered}
+\frac{T \cdot \Delta S}{\text { Energy wasted }} \\
\text { as glycogen }
\end{gathered}
$$

Thus, some of the increased total energy $(\Delta \mathrm{E})$ will be stored as glycogen $(\Delta \mathrm{G})$. However, because of the inefficiencies of the chemical reactions that convert glucose to glycogen, some of the $\Delta \mathrm{E}$ is wasted as heat ( $\mathrm{T} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{S}$ ). Another way of stating the second law is that $\mathrm{T} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{S}$ can never be zero or negative, and chemical reactions can never be $100 \%$ efficient.

![bo05091984b7](bo05091984b7.jpg)

Figure 58-5 Hydrolysis of ATP to ADP, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

If we add no energy to the body (i.e., $\Delta \mathrm{E}$ is zero), the body's total free energy must decline (i.e., $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ is negative). This decline in G matches the rise in $\mathrm{T} \cdot \mathrm{S}$, reflecting inefficiencies inherent in chemical transformations. Consider, for example, what would happen if you took 1 mole of glucose $(180 \mathrm{~g})$, put it into a bomb calorimeter with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, and completely burned the glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. This combustion would yield 686 kcal in the form of heat but would conserve no usable energy. Now consider what happens if your body burns this same 1 mole of glucose. In contrast to the bomb calorimeter, your mitochondria not only would oxidize glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ but also would conserve part of the free energy in the form of ATP. Each of the many chemical conversion steps from glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ makes available a small amount of the total energy contained in glucose. Converting 1 mole of ADP and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ to 1 mole of ATP under the conditions prevailing in a cell consumes $\sim 11.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$. Therefore, if a particular step in glucose oxidation releases at least $11.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$, it can be coupled to ATP synthesis. The conversion of the lowerenergy ADP to the higher-energy ATP traps energy in the system, thus conserving it for later use. The cellular oxidation of 1 mole of glucose conserves $\sim 400 \mathrm{kcal}$ of the potential $686 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$; the remaining $286 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ is liberated as heat.

## Free energy, conserved as high-energy bonds in ATP, provides the energy for cellular functions

ATP consists of a nitrogenous ring (adenine), a 5-carbon sugar (ribose), and three phosphate groups (Fig. 58-5). The last two phosphates are connected to the rest of the molecule by high-energy bonds. The same is true for a related nucleotide, GTP. If we compare the free energies of phosphate bonds of various molecules, we see that the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP lie toward the middle of the freeenergy scale. Thus, in the presence of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}, \mathrm{ADP}$ can accept energy from compounds that are higher on the free-energy
scale (e.g., phosphocreatine), whereas ATP can release energy in the formation of compounds that are lower on the free-energy scale (e.g., G6P). ATP can therefore store energy derived from energy-releasing reactions and release energy needed to drive other chemical reactions.

Examples of the chemical reactions fueled by converting ATP to ADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ include the formation of bridges between actin and myosin during muscle contraction and the pumping of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ against its electrochemical gradient during muscle relaxation. (5) N58-4

## ENERGY INTERCONVERSION FROM CYCLING BETWEEN 6-CARBON AND 3-CARBON MOLECULES

Some metabolic reactions are neither uniquely anabolic nor catabolic, but they serve to interconvert the carbon skeletons of the building blocks of the three major energy formscarbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. In this subchapter, we focus on two major pathways of interconversion: glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

## Glycolysis converts the 6-carbon glucose molecule to two 3-carbon pyruvate molecules

The breakdown of glucose to pyruvate (Fig. 58-6A) can occur in the presence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (aerobic glycolysis) or the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (anaerobic glycolysis). This process yields 47 kcal of free energy per mole of glucose. Of this energy, the cell can trap enough to yield directly 2 moles of ATP per mole of glucose (Table 58-3), even under the relatively inefficient anaerobic conditions. Under aerobic conditions, the mitochondria can generate an additional three or five ATP molecules per glucose molecule from two reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) molecules. (5) N58-5 Cells that contain few mitochondria (e.g., fast-twitch muscle fibers; see pp. 249-250) or no mitochondria (i.e., erythrocytes (5) N58-6) rely exclusively on anaerobic glycolysis for energy.

## N58-4 Hydrolysis of ATP

## Contributed by Kitt Petersen and Gerald Shulman

Although the conversion of ATP to ADP and $P_{i}$ is often referred to as a hydrolysis reaction, because the traditional representation is ATP $+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{i}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the reaction actually occurs in two steps. The first typically involves transfer of a part of the phosphate group to an intermediate molecule, thus increasing the intermediate's free-energy content. The second step involves displacing the phosphate moiety, which releases $P_{i}$ and energy. In contrast, true hydrolysis reactions merely release heat, which cannot be trapped to drive chemical processes.

## N58-6 Red Blood Cells

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As noted on pages 434-435 of the text, mature erythrocytes lack all organelles, including mitochondria. Of the glucose that they take up, $90 \%$ undergoes glycolysis to provide ATP. The remaining $10 \%$ follows the pentose phosphate pathway (see Fig. 58-1)-also known as the hexose monophosphate shunt or the phosphogluconate pathway-to produce NADPH (i.e., reducing equivalents) as well as 5-carbon sugars.

## N58-5 NADH/NAD ${ }^{+}$versus NADPH/NADP ${ }^{+}$

## Contributed by Alisha Bouzaher

NADH and $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$are, respectively, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) and their close analogs are NADPH and NADP ${ }^{+}$, the reduced and oxidized forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP). The coenzymes NADH and NADPH each consist of two nucleotides joined at their phosphate groups by a phosphoanhydride bond. NADPH is structurally distinguishable from NADH by the additional phosphate group residing on the ribose ring of the nucleotide, which allows enzymes to preferentially interact with either molecule.

Total concentrations of $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}\left(10^{-5} \mathrm{M}\right)$ are higher in the cell by $\sim 10$-fold compared to $\mathrm{NADP}^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}\left(10^{-6} \mathrm{M}\right)$. Ratios of the oxidized and reduced forms of these coenzymes offer perspective into the metabolic activity of the cell. The high $\mathrm{NAD}^{+} / \mathrm{NADH}$ ratio favors the transfer of a hydride from a substrate to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to form NADH, the reduced form of the molecule and oxidizing agent. Therefore, $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$is highly prevalent within catabolic reaction pathways where reducing equivalents (carbohydrate, fats, and proteins) transfer protons and electrons to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. NADH acts as an energy carrier, transferring electrons from one reaction to another. Conversely, the NADP ${ }^{+} / \mathrm{NADPH}$ ratio is low, favoring the transfer of a hydride to a substrate oxidizing NADPH to NADP ${ }^{+}$. Thus, NADPH is utilized as a reducing agent within anabolic reactions, particularly the biosynthesis of fatty acids.

*Under anaerobic conditions, glycolysis-which takes place in the cytosolyields two lactate molecules plus two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. Under aerobic conditions, the metabolism of glucose does not proceed to lactate and thus yields a net gain of two NADH molecules per glucose molecule. The oxidative phosphorylation of each NADH molecule will yield 1.5 or 2.5 ATP molecules, depending on which shuttle system the cell uses to transfer the reducing equivalents from the cytosol into the mitochondria. 5 N58-15 Therefore, under aerobic conditions, glycolysis of one glucose molecule generates two ATP molecules directly plus three or five ATP molecules via the oxidative phosphorylation of the two NADH molecules, for a total of five or seven ATP molecules per glucose molecule. This yield is summarized in the first two rows of Table 58-4.

About a century and a half ago, Pasteur recognized that glycolysis by yeast occurs faster in anaerobic conditions than in aerobic conditions. 6 N58-7 This Pasteur effect reflects the cell's attempt to maintain a constant [ATP], by controlling the rate at which glycolysis breaks down glucose to generate ATP. The key is the allosteric regulation of enzymes that catalyze the three reactions in the glycolytic pathway that are essentially irreversible: hexokinase (or glucokinase in liver and pancreas), phosphofructokinase (PFK), and pyruvate kinase (highlighted in green in Fig. 58-6A). In each case, either the direct reaction product (i.e., G6P in the case of hexokinase) or downstream metabolic products (e.g., ATP in the case of the other two) inhibits the enzyme. If glycolysis should temporarily outstrip the cell's need for ATP, the buildup of products slows glycolysis. Thus, introducing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ activates the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185), which raises $\left[\mathrm{ATP}_{i}\right]_{i}$, inhibits PFK and pyruvate kinase, and slows glycolysis.

Under anaerobic conditions, cells convert pyruvate to lactate, which is accompanied by the accumulation of $\mathrm{H}^{+}-$ lactic acidosis. This acidosis, in turn, can impede muscle contraction by decreasing muscle cell pH , which can result in muscle cramps and inhibition of key glycolytic enzymes needed for ATP synthesis. Thus, sustained skeletal muscle activity depends on the aerobic metabolism of pyruvate as well as FAs.

## Gluconeogenesis converts nonhexose precursors to the 6-carbon glucose molecule

Gluconeogenesis is essential for life because the brain and anaerobic tissues-formed elements of blood (erythrocytes, leukocytes), bone marrow, and the renal medulla-normally depend on glucose as the primary fuel source. The daily glucose requirement of the brain in an adult is $\sim 120 \mathrm{~g}$, which accounts for most of the 180 g of glucose produced by the
liver. The major site for gluconeogenesis is the liver, with the renal cortex making a much smaller contribution. During prolonged fasting ( 2 to 3 months), the kidney can account for up to $40 \%$ of total glucose production.

Although glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate (see Fig. 58-6A) and gluconeogenesis converts pyruvate to glucose (see Fig. 58-6B), gluconeogenesis is not simply glycolysis in reverse. The thermodynamic equilibrium of glycolysis lies strongly on the side of pyruvate formation (i.e., the $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ is very negative). Thus, in contrast to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis requires energy, consuming four ATP, two GTP, and two NADH molecules for every glucose molecule formed. Most of the $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ decrease in glycolysis occurs in the three essentially irreversible steps indicated by single arrows in Figure 58-6A. Gluconeogenesis bypasses these three irreversible, high- $\Delta \mathrm{G}$ glycolytic reactions by using four enzymes: pyruvate carboxylase, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase), and G6Pase (see Fig. 58-6B). The enzymes of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis are present in separate cellular compartments to minimize futile cycling of substrates between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis; the glycolytic enzymes reside in the cytosolic compartment, whereas the gluconeogenic enzymes are present in the mitochondria (pyruvate carboxylase) or in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (G6P).

The liver accomplishes gluconeogenesis by taking up, and converting to glucose, several nonhexose precursors (see Fig. 58-6B). These include two breakdown products of glycolysis (lactate and pyruvate), all the intermediates of the citric acid cycle, 18 of the 20 amino acids, and glycerol. Regardless of the precursor-except for glycerol-all pathways go through oxaloacetate (OA). Thus, the liver can convert lactate to pyruvate, and then convert pyruvate to OA via pyruvate carboxylase, consuming one ATP. Similarly, the citric acid cycle can convert all its intermediates to OA. Finally, the liver can deaminate all amino acids-except leucine and lysine-to form pyruvate, OA, or three other intermediates of the citric acid cycle ( $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, succinyl coenzyme A [CoA], or fumarate). The major gluconeogenic amino acids are alanine and glutamine. 7 N58-8 Leucine and lysine are not gluconeogenic because their deamination leads to acetyl CoA, which cannot generate net OA (see p. 1185). Similarly, FAs are not gluconeogenic because their breakdown products are almost exclusively acetyl CoA. In contrast, leucine and lysine are ketogenic because cells can convert acetyl CoA to FAs (Fig. 58-7) or ketone bodies (see p. 1185).

Once the liver has converted the precursor to OA, the next step is the conversion of OA to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEPCK, which consumes one GTP molecule (see Fig. 58-6B). The liver can convert PEP to fructose-1,6bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) by using the glycolytic enzymes in reverse. The gluconeogenic precursor glycerol enters the pathway at dihydroxyacetone phosphate. FBPase converts F-1,6-BP to fructose-6-phosphate, and G6Pase completes gluconeogenesis by converting G6P to glucose.

The major gluconeogenic precursors are (1) lactate, which is derived from glycolysis in muscle and anaerobic tissues; (2) alanine, which is mostly derived from glycolysis and transamination of pyruvate in skeletal muscle; and (3) glycerol, which is derived from lipolysis in adipocytes.

## N58-7 Allosteric Regulation of Glycolytic Enzymes by Metabolic Products (Pasteur Effect)

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

As pointed out on page 1176, the three enzymes of the glycolytic pathway that catalyze reactions that are essentially irreversible are also all under all allosteric control.

Hexokinase in muscle (the comparable enzyme in liver is glucokinase) catalyzes the essentially irreversible conversion of free glucose to G6P (see Fig. 58-64) and thereby traps the sugar inside the cell and enables it to enter the glycolytic pathway. Hexokinase is inhibited by increased concentrations of its reaction product, G6P. Thus, when the concentration of G6P increases excessively, hexokinase is temporarily inhibited (negative feedback), which reduces the rate of G6P production and enables it to match once again the rate of consumption in the steady state.

The enzyme phosphofructokinase (PFK) catalyzes the essentially irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (see Fig. 58-64). The activity of PFK is allosterically regulated by the cellular energy status, increasing with decreases in [ATP] (or with increases in ATP breakdown products), and vice versa. Further, an increased concentration of citrate-which indicates that pyruvate is being provided to the citric acid cycle faster than it can be used-increases the inhibitory influence of ATP on PFK, attenuating the rate of glycolysis further and thus signaling that the cell's energy needs are being met.

Pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of glycolysis, the essentially irreversible transfer of the phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to ADP, yielding ATP and pyruvate (see Fig. 58-64). A high [ATP] decreases the affinity of pyruvate kinase for PEP, reducing the rate of reaction at the [PEP], normally prevailing. Pyruvate kinase is also inhibited by acetyl CoA, which is the entry molecule to the citric acid cycle, a source of high ATP production.

The allosteric inhibitors (indicated above in bold italics) of the aforementioned three enzymes are responsible for the observation by Pasteur (the so-called Pasteur effect) that glycolysis is slower under aerobic conditions, when these allosteric inhibitors are present at higher concentrations.

## Reciprocal regulation of glycolysis and gluconeogenesis minimizes futile cycling

We already noted that key glycolytic and gluconeogenic enzymes are located in separate compartments. The liver also reciprocally and coordinately regulates these processes so that when one pathway is active the other pathway is relatively inactive. This regulation is important because both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are highly exergonic, and therefore no thermodynamic barrier prevents futile cycling of substrates between these two pathways. Because glycolysis creates two ATP molecules and gluconeogenesis consumes four ATP and two GTP molecules, a full cycle from one glucose to two pyruvates and back again would have a net cost of two ATP and two GTP molecules. The liver regulates flux through these pathways in the short term mostly by allosteric regulation of enzyme activity, and in the long term by transcriptional regulation of gene expression.

Allosteric Regulation PFK (glycolysis) is stimulated by AMP, whereas it is inhibited by citrate and ATP (see Fig. 58-6A). FBPase (gluconeogenesis) is inhibited by AMP and is activated by citrate (see Fig. 58-6B). In addition, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP), 7 N58-9 which is under the reciprocal control of glucagon and insulin, reciprocally regulates these two enzymes, stimulating PFK and inhibiting FBPase. In the fed state, when the glucagon level is low (see pp. 1050-1051) and the insulin level is high (see p. 1041), [F-2,6-BP] is high, which promotes consumption of glucose. Conversely, in the fasted state, [F-2,6-BP] is low, which promotes gluconeogenesis.

Similarly, the liver reciprocally regulates pyruvate kinase (glycolysis) and pyruvate carboxylase/PEPCK (gluconeogenesis). High concentrations of ATP and alanine inhibit pyruvate kinase, whereas ADP inhibits pyruvate carboxylase. Furthermore, acetyl CoA inhibits pyruvate kinase but activates pyruvate carboxylase.

In this way, high concentrations of biosynthetic precursors and ATP favor gluconeogenesis and suppress glycolysis. Conversely, high concentrations of AMP, reflecting a low energy charge of the liver, suppress gluconeogenesis and favor glycolysis.

Transcriptional Regulation More long-term regulation of gluconeogenesis and glycolysis occurs by hormonal regulation of gene expression. The major hormones involved in this process are insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, and cortisol. In contrast to allosteric regulation, which occurs in seconds to minutes, transcriptional regulation occurs over hours to days. Insulin, which increases following a meal (see p. 1041), stimulates the expression of the glycolytic enzymes PFK and pyruvate kinase, as well as the enzyme that makes F-2,6-BP. 7 N58-9 In addition, as noted in Figure 51-8, insulin suppresses the expression of the key gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK, FBPase, and G6Pase. Insulin leads to the phosphorylation of the FOXO1 transcription factor, which prevents FOXO1 from entering the nucleus and activating transcription of genes that encode these enzymes.

Conversely, glucagon, the levels of which increase during starvation, inhibits the expression of the glycolytic enzymes PFK and pyruvate kinase, as well as the enzyme
that makes F-2,6-BP. Epinephrine and norepinephrine, released under conditions of stress, have actions similar to those of glucagon. At the same time, these hormones stimulate the expression of the gluconeogenic enzymes PEPCK and G6Pase via cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA). Phosphorylation of the transcriptional factor CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein; see p. 89) directly promotes both increased transcription of gluconeogenic genes (e.g., PEPCK) and increased transcription of the transcriptional cofactor PGC-1 $\alpha$ (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- $\gamma$ coactivator- $1 \alpha$ ). PGC-1 $\alpha$ then binds and activates the transcription factors HNF4 and FOXO1, which further promote the transcription of these key gluconeogenic enzymes.

## Cells can convert glucose or amino acids into FAs

The body-principally the liver-can convert glucose to FAs. As shown in Figure 58-6A, glycolysis converts glucose to pyruvate, which can enter the mitochondrion via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier, or MPC (see Fig. 58-7). When ATP demand is low, high levels of ATP, acetyl CoA, and NADH inside the mitochondria inhibit pyruvate dehydrogenase, which converts pyruvate to acetyl CoA-the normal entry point into the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185). Conversely, high levels of ATP and acetyl CoA stimulate pyruvate carboxylase, which instead converts pyruvate to OA, the last element in the citric acid cycle. The mitochondrion then converts the OA and acetyl CoA to citrate, which it exports to the cytosol via an exchanger called the citrate carrier, or CIC (SLC25A1). A cytosolic enzyme called citrate lyase converts the citrate back to OA and acetyl CoA. The hepatocyte converts the cytosolic OA to malate or pyruvate, each of which can re-enter the mitochondrion. Thus, the net effect is to make acetyl CoA disappear from the mitochondrion and appear in the cytosol for FA synthesis.

As noted above, the breakdown of ketogenic amino acids 7 N58-8 yields acetyl CoA (see p. 1176). This acetyl CoA can also contribute to FA synthesis. In addition, the breakdown of other amino acids yields pyruvate or intermediates of the citric acid cycle, which again can contribute to FA synthesis.

The synthesis of FAs from acetyl CoA takes place in the cytosol, whereas the oxidation of FAs to acetyl CoA occurs in the mitochondrion (see below, pp. 1183-1185). The first committed step-and the rate-limiting step-in FA synthesis is the ATP-dependent carboxylation of acetyl CoA (2 carbons) to form malonyl CoA (3 carbons), catalyzed by acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). 7 N58-10 The next step is the sequential addition of 2-carbon units to a growing acyl chain, shown as $-\mathrm{CO}-\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{n}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ in Figure 58-7, to produce an FA. With each round of elongation, a malonyl CoA molecule reacts with FA synthase, which then decarboxylates the malonyl moiety and condenses the growing acyl chain to the remaining 2-carbon malonyl fragment. The subsequent reduction, dehydration, and reduction steps-all catalyzed by the same multifunctional peptide-complete one round of elongation. Starting from a priming acetyl group (which comes from acetyl CoA), seven rounds of addition-in addition to a hydrolysis step to remove the acyl chain from the enzyme-are required to produce palmitate:

## N58-9 Fructose-2,6-Bisphosphate

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Although structurally very similar to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate (F-2,6-BP) is neither a substrate nor a product in either glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. However, it is an allosteric regulator of both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

The enzyme phosphofructokinase 2 (PFK-2) phosphorylates fructose-6-phosphate to yield F-2,6-BP. Conversely, the enzyme fructose-2,6,-bisphosphatase 2 (FBPase-2) removes one phosphate from F-2,6-BP to yield fructose-6-phosphate. Interestingly, a single bifunctional protein mediates both the PFK-2 and FBPase-2 activities. These two enzymes are distinct from phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK in Fig. 58-6A) and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (FBPase-1; see Fig. 58-6B).

Fructose-6-phosphate is an important allosteric regulator of both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. By modulating the two enzymes noted above, insulin raises but glucagon lowers cytosolic [F-2,6-BP]. Thus, in the fed state (high insulin/ low glucagon), [F-2,6-BP] rises, thereby stimulating glycolysis but inhibiting gluconeogenesis.

(5) NS8-11 The liver can package TAGs as very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs; see p. 968) for export to the blood.

## The body permits only certain energy interconversions

The body has a hierarchy for energy interconversion. As discussed above, the body can convert amino acids to glucose (gluconeogenesis) and fat, glucose to fat, and glucose to certain amino acids. However, the body cannot convert fat to either glucose or amino acids. Fats can only be stored or oxidized. The reason is that cells oxidize FAs two carbons at a time to acetyl CoA (a 2-carbon molecule; see pp. 11831185), which they cannot convert into pyruvate (a 3-carbon molecule) or OA (a 4-carbon molecule). The only exceptions are the uncommon FAs that have an odd number of carbon atoms, and even with these, only the terminal 3-carbon unit escapes oxidation to acetyl CoA. Thus, almost all carbon atoms in FAs end up as acetyl CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185). There, isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase release the two carbon atoms of acetyl CoA as two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules, which thus yields no net production of OA or pyruvate. In contrast, plants have two additional enzymes (the glyoxylate cycle) that allow them to convert two molecules of acetyl CoA to OA and glucose.

## ENERGY CAPTURE (ANABOLISM)

During feeding, when the energy ingested as food exceeds the energy released by oxidation, the body stores excess calories as glycogen or fat. However, storing energy has a cost, although it is relatively inexpensive from a total-energy standpoint. The process of digesting a mixed meal in the GI tract elevates the whole-body metabolic rate $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ higher than the RMR for $\sim 90$ minutes following a meal. In addition to this cost of digesting and absorbing, the energy cost of storing dietary carbohydrate as glycogen or dietary lipid as TAGs is $3 \%$ to $7 \%$ of the energy taken in. The cost of storing amino acids as protein is nearly $25 \%$ of the energy taken in. Moreover, storage after interconversions among dietary categories is particularly expensive. The cost of storing dietary carbohydrate as TAGs, or of storing amino acids as glycogen, is nearly $25 \%$ of the intake energy.

## After a carbohydrate meal, the body burns some ingested glucose and incorporates the rest into glycogen or TAGs

Three mechanisms maintain normoglycemia following carbohydrate ingestion: (1) suppression of hepatic glucose production; (2) stimulation of hepatic glucose uptake; and (3) stimulation of glucose uptake by peripheral tissues, predominantly muscle. Insulin is the primary signal, which
orchestrates the storage and metabolism of glucose via the insulin receptor (see Fig. 51-5). Glucose is the dominant signal for insulin secretion. However, with meals, other signals converge on the $\beta$ cells of the pancreatic islets to coordinate insulin secretion, as becomes apparent when one compares the insulin responses to identical amounts of glucose loads given intravenously versus orally (see Fig. 51-3A). Viewed differently, for similar plasma glucose levels, oral glucose raises plasma [insulin] several-fold higher than does intravenous glucose. This differential insulin response is due to the secretion of multiple incretins (see p. 1041)especially glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP)-as well as from parasympathetic innervation of the pancreatic $\beta$ cells. The incretins and neural signals prime the $\beta$ cells, magnifying insulin release following meal-induced increases in blood glucose. This priming is absent when blood glucose increases as a result of increased hepatic glycogenolysis in response to stress, and thus minimizes the potentially detrimental hyperinsulinemia during stress.

Liver Following a carbohydrate meal, levels of insulin and glucose rise in the portal vein (similar to the situation shown in Fig. 51-3A), whereas glucagon levels fall. These changes suppress hepatic glucose production and promote net hepatic glucose uptake. Thus, the liver buffers the entry of glucose from the portal vein into the systemic circulation, thereby minimizing fluctuations in plasma [glucose] while promoting glucose storage. Once plasma [glucose] returns to baseline, the liver resumes net glucose production to maintain normoglycemia. Depending on the size of the carbohydrate load, the liver may take up one fourth to one third of the ingested exogenous glucose load. Because the liver not only decreases its production of glucose but also takes up a significant amount of glucose, the contribution of the liver to postprandial glucose homeostasis is substantial and approaches that of muscle.

Glucose taken up by the liver during the meal is predominantly stored as glycogen. The liver synthesizes glycogen by both a direct pathway from exogenous glucose and an indirect pathway from gluconeogenesis (Fig. 58-8A). When we ingest a meal following an overnight fast, these pathways contribute roughly equally to hepatic glycogen synthesis. However, the relative contributions of these pathways depends on the composition of the diet, the level of glycemia achieved during the meal, and the relative concentrations of insulin and glucagon. A high-carbohydrate diet, hyperglycemia, and insulin promote the direct pathway, whereas reduced carbohydrate intake, lower plasma [glucose], and elevations in circulating [glucagon] stimulate the indirect pathway.

Hepatic glycogen stores peak 4 to 6 hours following a meal. Thus, when we ingest three meals per day at 4 - to 6 -hour intervals, hepatic glycogen stores increase throughout the day in a staircase fashion. During this time, most of the glucose required for metabolism comes from exogenous glucose (see dashed arrow in Fig. 58-8A). Glycogen stores reach their peak around midnight, after which hepatic glycogenolysis contributes $\sim 50 \%$ to whole-body glucose production and the other $50 \%$ derives from hepatic gluconeogenesis.

Figure 58-8 Energy storage following meals. A, Three major organs handle the glucose assimilated by the small intestine. Liver stores some glucose as glycogen, and converts some to FAs—packaged as VLDLs—for export to adipocytes. Muscle stores some glucose as glycogen and converts some to lactate and gluconeogenic amino acids for export to the liver. Adipocytes convert glucose to glycerol-3-phosphate, a precursor of TAGs. B, Two major organs handle the amino acids assimilated by the small intestine. Liver converts gluconeogenic amino acids to glycogen. Muscle converts amino acids to glycogen. C, Chylomicrons from the small intestine undergo hydrolysis in systemic blood vessels. Adipocytes re-esterify the resulting FAs (together with glycerol-3-phosphate generated from glucose) for storage as TAGs. ECF, extracellular fluid; RBC, red blood cell.

Because the liver has citrate lyase, it can also convert glucose that it takes up following a meal to FAs (see Fig. 58-8A) via reactions summarized in Figure 58-7. The hepatocyte esterifies these FAs to glycerol to make TAGs, which it packages as VLDLs for export to the blood.

Muscle Glucose escaping the liver is cleared predominantly by striated muscle, which stores most of this glucose as glycogen (see Fig. 58-8A). Muscle metabolizes the remaining glucose via the glycolytic pathway and then either oxidizes the products or recycles them to the liver, mostly as lactate and alanine.

The uptake of glucose into muscle-as well as adipose tissue-is regulated predominantly by a rise in [insulin] and, to a lesser extent, by the hyperglycemia per se. Insulin, via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway (see p. 1042), promotes translocation of the GLUT4 glucose transporter (see p. 1047) to the plasma membrane, and thus stimulates glucose uptake by muscle and fat. In addition, insulin modulates the subsequent metabolism of glucose by increasing the activity of glycogen synthase, thereby promoting glucose storage, and by increasing the activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase, thereby increasing glucose oxidation as well.

Adipose Tissue Although adipose tissue typically represents a large component of the peripheral mass ( $10 \%$ to $15 \%$ of body weight in men, $25 \%$ to $30 \%$ in women ), adipocytes metabolize only a minor fraction of ingested glucose (see Fig. 58-8C). The reason is that, in contrast to the liver, human adipocytes have a relatively low metabolic rate and contain relatively little citrate lyase, and thus have a low capability of converting glucose into FAs. However, adipocytes use glucose as the starting material for generating glycerol-3-phosphate. ( $\mathbf{\text { N58-12 }}$ which serves as the backbone for TAG synthesis (see Fig. 58-8A). As we saw above, in times of caloric and carbohydrate excess, the liver (which has an abundance of citrate lyase) synthesizes FAs de novo from glucose and esterifies the FAs to generate TAGs, which it then exports in the form of VLDL particles (see Fig. 46-15). Lipoprotein lipase (LPL; see p. 1050) on the luminal surface of endothelial cells hydrolyzes the TAGs in VLDLs and chylomicrons to FAs. Subsequently the FAs enter adipocytes, which re-esterify them to form TAGs for storage. These adipocytes are mostly in the subcutaneous and visceral tissues and, to a much smaller extent, around muscle.

The larger the meal, the greater the rate of glucose uptake by liver, muscle, and adipose tissue-because of higher levels of circulating insulin and glucose. In contrast, the brain uses

## BOX 58-1 Fructose Ingestion

The hepatic metabolism of fructose differs from that of glucose in ways that are important to human health. Hepatic glucose metabolism is tightly regulated by PFK (see p. 1176), which is inhibited by ATP and citrate. Thus, a sufficient energy status signals hepatocytes to reduce uptake of dietary glucose, much of which now bypasses the liver to reach the systemic circulation. In contrast, dietary fructose is metabolized to fructose-1-phosphate by fructokinase, which is independent of hepatic energy status and the inhibitory effects of high [ATP] and [citrate]. Thus, fructose uptake and metabolism by the liver is unregulated, and relatively little ingested fructose reaches the systemic circulation. In the liver, a large fructose load-as from soft drinks sweetened with inexpensive high-fructose corn syrup-can result in increased de novo lipogenesis and inhibition of FA oxidation. This process contributes to the development of hepatic insulin resistance and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Owing to the current epidemic of obesity, NAFLD is now the most common liver disorder in adults and children. (Contributed by Fred Suchy.)
glucose, its major oxidative fuel, at a constant rate, despite these fluctuations in plasma glucose during feeding. GLUT1 facilitates glucose uptake across the blood-brain barrier, and GLUT3 mediates glucose uptake into neurons, independent of insulin (Box 58-1).

## After a protein meal, the body burns some ingested amino acids and incorporates the rest into proteins

Following a protein meal, the amino acids absorbed by the GI tract (see pp. 922-925) have two major fates: they can either be oxidized to yield energy or be incorporated into protein. The liver removes a large fraction of amino acids that enter portal blood following a meal, particularly the gluconeogenic amino acids (see Fig. 58-8B). In contrast, the liver less avidly removes the branched-chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, and valine), which muscle predominantly captures. Indeed, branched-chain amino acids are critical for the immediate repletion of muscle protein because they have a unique capacity to promote net protein accumulation, predominantly by inhibiting protein breakdown and to some extent by stimulating protein synthesis.

Insulin plays a major role in orchestrating protein anabolism, mostly by suppressing protein degradation. Therefore, the combination of the hyperinsulinemia and

Glycerol has no asymmetric carbon atoms. However, adding a phosphate group at either end makes the middle carbon atom asymmetric. Depending on whether you assign the appellation carbon 1 to one end of the molecule or the other, the same compound is known either as L-glycerol-3phosphate or D-glycerol-1-phosphate. Another synonym is $\alpha$-glycerol phosphate. When stereospecific numbering (sn) is used, the compound is unambiguously known as sn-glycerol-3-phosphate. For the sake of simplicity in the text, we simply refer to it as glycerol-3-phosphate.

hyperaminoacidemia that follows a protein meal not only blocks proteolysis but also stimulates protein synthesis, resulting in net protein accumulation. Because some amino acids (e.g., arginine, leucine) are weak insulin secretagogues (see p. 1139), a protein meal stimulates insulin release even when the meal lacks carbohydrate. Under such conditions, glucagon plays a critical role in preventing potential hypoglycemia by maintaining hepatic glucose production in the face of hyperinsulinemia. In a mixed meal, the presence of carbohydrates augments insulin secretion beyond the effect of protein alone and further enhances protein anabolism.

## After a fatty meal, the body burns some ingested FAs and incorporates the rest into TAGs

Following a fat-containing meal (see Fig. 58-8C), lipases in the duodenum hydrolyze the TAGs to FAs and glycerol, which enterocytes in the small intestine take up, re-esterify into TAGs, and secrete as chylomicrons. (5) NS8-11 The chylomicrons enter the lymphatics and then the systemic circulation.

Insulin, secreted in response to the carbohydrate or protein components of the meal, has three major effects on lipid metabolism. First, insulin induces synthesis of LPL (see p. 1050), which-at the luminal membrane of endothelial cells-promotes hydrolysis of TAGs to FAs and glycerol. The breakdown products enter the adipocytes for re-esterification into TAGs. Insulin promotes storage in muscle and adipose tissue of both exogenous TAGs (derived from a meal and carried in chylomicrons; see p. 930), as shown in Figure 58-8C, and endogenous TAGs (produced by the liver and carried in VLDLs; see p. 968), as shown in Figure 58-8A.

Second, insulin stimulates glucose uptake into adipocytes by stimulating GLUT4. The adipocytes transform the glucose to glycerol-3-phosphate, as discussed above (see p. 1181), which is the backbone required for the re-esterification of FAs into TAGs. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase and therefore, unlike liver and kidney, are unable to phosphorylate glycerol directly.

Third, in fat cells, insulin inhibits adipose triacylglycerol lipase (ATGL; see p. 1050), which releases an FA from a TAG to form a diacylglycerol (DAG; TAG $\rightarrow$ DAG + FA), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), which releases an FA from a DAG to form a monoacylglycerol (MAG; DAG $\rightarrow$ MAG + FA). These enzymes-not to be confused with LPL-catalyze the hydrolysis of stored TAGs in adipocytes. By suppressing lipolysis, insulin markedly decreases plasma [FA] and promotes net storage of absorbed fat into the adipocyte.

In a mixed meal-when glucose, amino acids, and FAs are all available-an increase in plasma [insulin] augments the incorporation of these substances into glycogen, protein, and fat. This is accomplished by inhibiting glycogenolysis, proteolysis, and lipolysis as well as by promoting the opposite of these three processes. Because of the dose-response relationships, low levels of insulin preferentially inhibit the breakdown of energy stores, whereas high levels preferentially stimulate energy accumulation. Thus, small meals (associated with smaller insulin responses) mainly conserve depots by reducing breakdown, whereas larger meals (and concomitant greater insulin responses) increase depots by stimulating storage.

## ENERGY LIBERATION (CATABOLISM)

The general principle in energy catabolism is that the body first breaks down a complex storage polymer (e.g., glycogen or TAGs) to simpler compounds (e.g., glucose, FAs, lactate) that the cells can then metabolize to provide energy, mostly in the form of ATP, for cellular function.

## The first step in energy catabolism is to break down glycogen or TAGs to simpler compounds

Skeletal Muscle Glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle is catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase (GP; Fig. 58-9A). In three ways, muscle contraction activates GP. First, epinephrine binds to a $\beta$-adrenergic receptor and thereby promotes the formation of cAMP (see p. 53). The cAMP activates PKA, which in turn phosphorylates glycogen phosphorylase kinase (PK). In parallel, PKA inactivates phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (see Fig. 3-7), thereby stabilizing the phosphorylated state of PK. The now active form of PK converts the inactive glycogen phosphorylase $b(\mathrm{GPb})$ to the active GPa. Second, muscle activity increases the turnover of ATP, thereby raising $[\mathrm{AMP}]_{i}$; the binding of AMP allosterically activates GPb. Conversely, at rest, ATP competes with AMP for this nucleotide-binding site on GPb and thus inhibits GPb. Third, intense activity of skeletal muscle causes $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ to rise; the binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to PK allosterically activates this enzyme, (5) NS8-13 and converts GPb to the active GPa. Skeletal muscle converts the product of glycogenolysis, glucose-1-phosphate (G1P), to G6P, which enters the glycolytic pathway within the muscle cell.

Liver As is the case in muscle, GPa in hepatocytes converts glycogen to G1P. The signaling pathways that establish the $\mathrm{GPa} / \mathrm{GPb}$ ratio are the same as in muscle, except that in the liver, it is mainly glucagon (see pp. 10501053) in the portal blood-and, to a lesser extent, epinephrine-that triggers the increase in [cAMP] $_{i}$ (see Fig. 58-9B). The liver then converts G1P to G6P, as in muscle. However, unlike muscle, liver contains the enzyme G6Pase; G6Pase cleaves the phosphate from G6P to yield glucose, which is free to enter the bloodstream. Thus, whereas glycogenolysis in skeletal muscle serves to meet local energy demands by releasing G6P, glycogenolysis in the liver serves to meet whole-body energy demands-mainly those of the central nervous system (CNS)-by releasing glucose to the blood.

Adipocytes In adipocytes, HSL catalyzes lipolysis, the hydrolysis of the ester linkages of TAGS to release FAs and glycerol. Nearly all ( $95 \%$ ) of the available energy of TAGS resides in the FA moieties. Two hormones can stimulate lipolysis: epinephrine, which the adrenal medulla secretes under conditions of low blood glucose or stress, and growth hormone (see pp. 990-995). As in skeletal muscle and hepatocytes, epinephrine acts through cAMP (see Fig. 58-9C). The result is activation of HSL and release of FAs, which exit the adipocytes into the bloodstream. There, the poorly soluble FAs bind to circulating albumin, which releases them at the sites of energy demand.

# N58-13 Glycogen Phosphorylase Kinase 

## Contributed by Kitt Petersen and Gerald Shulman

PK has the subunit structure $i \alpha \beta \gamma \delta i \iota$. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits are substrates for PKA. The $\delta$ subunits are in fact calmodulin (CaM). In other words, PK is a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-CaM-dependent kinase (i.e., a CaM kinase). Thus, an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ can activate PK allosterically and thereby promote the conversion of phosphorylase $\boldsymbol{b}$ to phosphorylase $\boldsymbol{a}$, which favors glycogenolysis.

See Figure 3-7 for a representation of how PKA inactivates phosphoprotein phosphatase 1 (PP1). B, In liver, primarily glucagon and also epinephrine trigger glucose production in the short term via glycogenolysis, and over the long term via gluconeogenesis. Because they have G6Pase, hepatocytes can generate glucose and export it to the blood.

## The second step in TAG catabolism is $\beta$-oxidation of FAs

In carbohydrate catabolism, after the breakdown of glycogen, the second step is glycolysis. In TAG metabolism, after the breakdown to FAs, the second step is the $\beta$-oxidation of

FAs, which takes place in the mitochondrial matrix. (Recall that FA synthesis takes place in the cytoplasm; see p. 1178.) Before $\beta$-oxidation, the hepatocyte uses FA transport protein 5 (FATP5 or SLC27A5) to transport the FA from the extracellular fluid into the cytosol (Fig. 58-10), where acyl

![bo14091984b7](bo14091984b7.jpg)

Figure 58-10 FA transport into mitochondrion and $\beta$-oxidation. FAD/FADH 2 , oxidized and reduced forms of flavin adenine dinucleotide, respectively; NAD ${ }^{+}$/NADH, oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, respectively.

CoA synthase activates the FA to acyl CoA (i.e., the FA chain coupled to CoA). To deliver acyl CoA to the mitochondrial matrix, the cell uses carnitine acyltransferase I (CAT I) on the cytosolic side of the mitochondrial outer membrane to transfer the acyl group to carnitine. The resulting acylcarnitine moves through a porin (see p. 109) in the mitochondrial outer membrane to enter the intermembrane space. The carnitine/acylcarnitine transporter (CAC, SLC25A20) on the mitochondrial inner membrane moves acylcarnitine into the mitochondrial matrix. There, CAT II transfers the acyl group back to CoA to form acyl CoA and carnitine. The carnitine recycles to the cytosol via CAC and the porin, whereas acyl CoA undergoes $\beta$-oxidation.
$\beta$-oxidation is a multistep process that removes a 2-carbon fragment from the end of an acyl CoA and releases the fragment as an acetyl CoA (see Fig. 58-10). The process also releases one reduced flavin adenine dinucleotide $\left(\mathrm{FADH}_{2}\right)$, one NADH, and the remainder of the acyl chain (beginning with the original $\beta$ carbon), which serves as the starting point for the next cycle. $\beta$-oxidation continues until it consumes the entire FA chain. For an FA chain containing $n$ carbons, the number of cycles is $(|n / 2|-1)$. The final cycle generates two acetyl CoA molecules. Unlike the breakdown of glucose, which can yield ATP even in the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (via glycolysis), the catabolism of FAs to yield energy in the form of ATP can occur only in the presence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Malonyl CoA plays a central role in regulating the balance between FA synthesis and $\beta$-oxidation. When energy levels are high, the enzyme ACC generates malonyl CoA from acetyl CoA, as shown in Figure 58-7. In turn, malonyl CoA provides the 2-carbon building blocks for FA synthesis. In contrast, malonyl inhibits CAT I and thereby inhibits $\beta$-oxidation (see Fig. 58-10).

## The final common steps in oxidizing carbohydrates, TAGs, and proteins to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are the citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation

Under aerobic conditions, cells containing mitochondria typically convert most of the pyruvate they generate from carbohydrate metabolism to acetyl CoA, rather than to lactate. Pyruvate-a 3-carbon piece of glucose's carbon skeleton-moves from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 58-11). There, pyruvate is oxidatively decarboxylated to acetyl CoA, which releases $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as well as an NADH. Acetyl CoA also forms in the mitochondria as the end product of the $\beta$-oxidation of FAs as well as amino-acid breakdown. The metabolism of the acetate moiety of acetyl CoA, as well as the oxidation of NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, is the final common pathway of aerobic catabolism, which releases $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, ATP, and heat.

Citric Acid Cycle A 2-carbon fragment-acetyl CoAderived from glucose, FA, or amino-acid metabolism enters the phase of catabolism known as the citric acid cycle, also called internal respiration (see p. 590) or oxidative decarboxylation because the 2-carbon fragment ends up as two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules (see Fig. 58-11). The citric acid cycle conserves the liberated energy as GTP and the reduced electron carriers NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$.

Cells tightly control the citric acid cycle by three mechanisms that limit substrate flux through the citric acid cycle: substrate availability, product accumulation, and feedback inhibition of key enzymes. Cells regulate the citric acid cycle at four sites. The two entry-point enzymes, pyruvate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase, are the most important. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) (7) N58-14 is inhibited allosterically by two of its immediate products (NADH and acetyl CoA) and one downstream product (ATP). The second primary site of regulation in the citric acid cycle is citrate synthase, which is under feedback inhibition of several immediate and downstream products (citrate, NADH, succinyl CoA, ATP). The citrate produced in this reaction feeds back negatively on PFK (see p. 1178), which effectively couples glycolysis and oxidative metabolism (see Fig. 58-6). Two other enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase and $\alpha$ ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, may also be rate limiting for the citric acid cycle under the right conditions.

Oxidative Phosphorylation The process by which mitochondria retrieve energy from $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ and NADH is oxidative phosphorylation. These reduced nucleotides are products of glycolysis (see Fig. 58-6), $\beta$-oxidation (see Fig. 58-10) conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA (see Fig. 58-11), and the citric acid cycle. Oxidative phosphorylation involves the transfer of electrons along a chain of molecules, and it ultimately traps the releasing energy in the formation of 1.5 ATP molecules per $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ and 2.5 ATP molecules per NADH (see Fig. 5-9B). 0)NS8-15

Ketogenesis Conditions such as prolonged fasting, consumption of a low-carbohydrate diet, or untreated diabetes mellitus lead to the production of three water-soluble byproducts of incomplete FA oxidation, substances collectively known as ketone bodies: acetoacetate, $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate, and acetone. What the conditions have in common is the accelerated $\beta$-oxidation of FAs, which produces acetyl CoA faster than the citric acid cycle can consume it. In addition, accelerated gluconeogenesis steals the OA (see Fig. 58-6B) that would be the entry point for acetyl CoA to enter the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 58-11). As a result, excess acetyl CoA spills over into the production of the three ketone bodies, primarily by liver mitochondria. As indicated by the downward orange arrows in Figure 58-12, the first three reactions in ketogenesis have the net effect of condensing two molecules of acetyl CoA and one $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into one molecule of acetoacetate, two molecules of HS CoA, and one $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, uncontrolled ketogenesis, which occurs in the absence of insulin (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis), causes a metabolic acidosis (see p. 635). The second and third reactions are essentially irreversible. Next, the liver can either reduce acetoacetate to D- $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate or decarboxylate the acetoacetate to acetone. The body rids itself of the volatile acetone and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules in the expired air. The acetone gives the breath a fruity odor that can be useful in the physical diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis.

Extrahepatic tissues-especially the CNS and striated muscle-can consume either one D- $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate or one acetoacetate molecule, as shown by the upward red arrows in Figure 58-12, to produce two acetyl CoA molecules that can then enter the citric acid cycle (see

# N58-14 Regulation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase 

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

The PDH enzyme complex is a massive assembly of three different enzymes (a total of 132 monomers) that catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl CoA. It is inhibited allosterically by two of its immediate products (NADH and acetyl CoA) and one downstream product (ATP). The PDH reaction is also regulated by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions that are catalyzed by kinases and phosphatases that are additional components of the enzyme complex. When [ATP], is high, a protein kinase phosphorylates one of the proteins in the complex, thereby inactivating it and stopping the reaction. Conversely, when [ATP], is low, a phosphatase hydrolyzes a phosphate group from this same enzyme, activating it and allowing the PDH enzyme complex reaction to proceed.

# N58-15 Shuttle Systems for Moving Reducing Equivalents 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As outlined in Figure 5-9B in the text, the electron transport chain of the mitochondrion uses the energy stored in the reducing equivalents NADH (and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ )-which themselves must be within the mitochondrial matrix-to pump $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the mitochondrial matrix to the mitochondrial intermembrane space (i.e., the space between the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes). Later, these $\mathrm{H}^{+}$flow back into the mitochondrial matrix "downhill" through ATP synthase, which uses the recovered energy to convert ADP and $P_{i}$ to ATP.

As outlined in Figure 58-11 and Table 58-4, most of these reducing equivalents (i.e., NADH and $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ ) originate in the mitochondrial matrix. In other words, they are created on the same side of the mitochondrial inner membrane on which they will be used. However, the two molecules of NADH that arise from the glycolysis of one glucose molecule (see Fig. 58-64) are created in the cytoplasm. Thus, the cell must somehow move these reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial inner membrane and into the mitochondrial matrix before the mitochondrion can use them to generate ATP. However, the cell cannot move the reducing equivalents directly across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Instead, it must use one of two complicated shuttle systems to do the job. One is called the malate-aspartate shuttle, and the other is called the glycerol-3phosphate shuttle. The efficiency of the two shuttle systems is quite different. The malate-aspartate shuttle is the more efficient of the two, ultimately yielding 2.5 ATPs per NADH. The glycerol3 -phosphate shuttle yields only 1.5 ATPs per NADH.

## Malate-Aspartate Shuttle

Most cells-particularly heart, kidney, and liver-use the malateaspartate shuttle system. The first step is catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase in the intermembrane space (IS):

$$
\text { NADH (IS) }+\mathrm{H}^{+} \text {(IS) + Oxaloacetate (IS) } \rightarrow \text { NAD }^{+}(\text {IS) }+ \text { Malate (IS) }
$$

(NE 58-1)
Next, the malate- $\alpha$-ketoglutarate exchanger in the mitochondrial inner membrane moves the malate into the mitochondrial matrix (MM) in exchange for $\alpha$-ketoglutarate ( $\alpha \mathrm{KG}$ ):

Malate (IS) $+\alpha \mathrm{KG}(\mathrm{MM}) \rightarrow$ Malate (MM) $+\alpha \mathrm{KG}$ (IS)
(NE 58-2)
Next, malate dehydrogenase in the mitochondrial matrix regenerates the NADH:
$\mathrm{NAD}^{+}(\mathrm{IS})+\mathrm{Malate}(\mathrm{MM}) \rightarrow \mathrm{NADH}(\mathrm{MM})+\mathrm{H}^{+}(\mathrm{MM})+\mathrm{Oxaloacetate}(\mathrm{MM})$
(NE 58-3)
This NADH can now enter the electron-transport chain. However, several more steps are required to complete the shuttle. Next, aspartate aminotransferase in the mitochondrial matrix consumes the oxaloacetate generated in Equation NE 58-3:

Oxaloacetate (MM) + Glutamate (MM) $\rightarrow$ Aspartate (MM) $+\alpha \mathrm{KG}$ (MM)
(NE 58-4)
This is the $\alpha \mathrm{KG}$ that exchanges for malate in Equation NE 58-2. In the meantime, the glutamate-aspartate exchanger in
the mitochondrial inner membrane moves the newly formed aspartate out of the mitochondrion in exchange for glutamate:

Aspartate (MM) + Glutamate (IS) $\rightarrow$ Aspartate (IS) + Glutamate (MM)
(NE 58-5)
This imported glutamate is the substrate in Equation NE 58-4. Finally, the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase in the intermembrane space catalyzes the following reaction:

Aspartate (IS) $+\alpha \mathrm{KG}$ (IS) $\rightarrow$ Oxaloacetate (IS) + Glutamate (IS)
(NE 58-6)
Equation NE 58-6 (which takes place in the intermembrane space) is the inverse of Equation NE 58-4 (which takes place in the mitochondrial matrix).

Summing these six reactions, you will see that the net effect is to transfer NADH from the intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix. Because the NADH enters the electron transport chain at complex I (see Fig. 5-9B), the electron transport chain can use the energy stored in the NADH molecule to pump $10 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ions out of the mitochondrion across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Because the net stoichiometry of ATP synthesis is one ATP for every four $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the NADH that passes through the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle generates 10/4 or 2.5 ATPs.

## Glycerol-3-Phosphate Shuttle

The brain and skeletal muscle use a shuttle system that-in terms of the number of ATPs generated per NADH-is only $60 \%$ as efficient as the malate-aspartate shuttle. In the first step, the cytosolic enzyme glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase simultaneously converts $\mathrm{NADH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$and converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP, an intermediate of glycolysis; see Fig. 58-6B) to glycerol-3-phosphate:
$\mathrm{NADH}+\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{DHAP} \rightarrow \mathrm{NAD}^{+}+$Glycerol-3-phosphate
(NE 58-7)
Next, another glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenasepresent on the outer surface of the mitochondrial inner membrane-converts the glycerol-3-phosphate back to DHAP while simultaneously transferring two H to an FAD to form $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ :

$$
\text { Glycerol-3-phosphate }+\mathrm{FAD} \rightarrow \mathrm{DHAP}+\mathrm{FADH}_{2}
$$

(NE 58-8)
This $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ can then transfer a pair of electrons that eventually pass through complexes III and IV (see Fig. 5-9B), which can pump six $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions out of the mitochondrion across the mitochondrial inner membrane. Because the net stoichiometry of ATP synthesis is one ATP for every four $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the NADH that passes through the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle generates only 6/4 or 1.5 ATPs.

## Oxidizing different fuels yields similar amounts of energy per unit $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed

The source with the greatest energy density ( $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g}$ ) is saturated FAs (see Table 58-1), which have a high density of

carbon and hydrogen that can be oxidized to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Accordingly, the complete combustion of 1 g of an energyrich fuel (i.e., lipid) requires more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. However, the energy yield per $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is similar among fuels, because about the same amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is needed to oxidize each carbon and hydrogen. The energy yield per unit of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is only slightly greater for carbohydrate ( $5.0 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{L}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) than for lipid ( $4.7 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{L}$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ). Carbohydrate, with its greater energy yield per $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, is the body's preferred fuel for combustion during maximal exercise when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ availability is limited. However, fat is the preferred fuel during prolonged activity, when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is available and fuel sources are abundant.

The metabolism of glucose by aerobic glycolysis and the citric acid cycle is far more efficient in providing energy in the form of ATP than anaerobic glycolysis in that complete oxidation of 1 molecule of glucose to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ via oxidative metabolism provides 30 to 32 molecules of ATP, whereas metabolism of 1 molecule of glucose to lactate by anaerobic glycolysis yields only $\sim 2$ molecules of ATP (Table 58-4). However, anaerobic glycolysis has the major advantage of being able to supply much more ATP per unit time than oxidative metabolism of glucose or fat. In this way, energy from glycogen supplies energy for muscle contraction during intense activities, such as sprinting. Responsible for this intense work are fast-twitch type 2 fibers, which have a much greater glycolytic capability but much lower mitochondrial density than slow-twitch type 1 fibers. Unfortunately, muscle can support this type of activity only for several minutes before lactate accumulates and the muscle cramps, or the muscle exhausts its stored glycogen. In contrast, oxidative metabolism of FAs is the major mechanism for supporting exercising muscle during prolonged activity, such as running a marathon, which is mostly the work of the slow-twitch type 1 muscle fibers (see pp. 1209-1212).

In the case of FA metabolism (see Fig. 58-10), each cycle of $\beta$-oxidation yields a total of 14 ATP molecules

|  | ENERGY DENSITY (kcal/g) | RQ |

| Protein | 4.3 | $0.80-0.85$ |
| Lipid | 9.4 | 0.70 |

(Table 58-5). The total number of ATP molecules generated from the FA depends on the number of carbon atoms in the FA chain. For example, palmitic acid, a 16 -carbon FA, needs seven $\beta$-oxidation cycles to form eight acetyl CoA molecules. The seven cycles generate $7 \times 14=98$ ATPs. The leftover acetyl CoA represents an additional 10 ATPs, for a total of 108 ATPs. Because the initial activation of the palmitate to palmitoyl CoA involves converting an ATP to AMP plus pyrophosphate-and regenerating ATP from AMP requires forming two high-energy phosphate bonds-the net ATP production is $108-2=106$ ATPs per palmitate oxidized.

For each primary fuel source, Table 58-6 provides the respiratory quotient (RQ; see p. 681) or ratio of moles of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced per mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed at the tissue level. The RQ reflects the density of oxygen atoms in the fuel source. For example, with carbohydrates, the cell needs to supply only enough external $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to oxidize the carbon atoms to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is already built into the carbohydrate molecule, which has an H-to-O ratio of $2: 1$.

For carbohydrate oxidation,
$\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}+6 \mathrm{O}_{2}+30$ or $32 \mathrm{ADP}+30$ or $32 \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightarrow$ Glucose

$$
\begin{gathered}
6 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+6 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+30 \text { or } 32 \text { ATP }+ \text { heat } \\
\left(\mathrm{RQ}=6 \mathrm{CO}_{2} / 6 \mathrm{O}_{2}=1.00\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

Because lipids contain so many fewer oxygen atoms, lipid oxidation requires more external $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

For lipid oxidation,
$\mathrm{C}_{15} \mathrm{H}_{31} \mathrm{COOH}+23 \mathrm{O}_{2}+106 \mathrm{ADP}+106 \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}} \rightarrow$ Palmitic acid

$$
\begin{gathered}
16 \mathrm{CO}_{2}+16 \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+106 \text { ATP }+ \text { heat } \\
\left(\mathrm{RQ}=16 \mathrm{CO}_{2} / 23 \mathrm{O}_{2}=0.70\right)
\end{gathered}
$$

The RQ for protein oxidation is 0.80 to 0.85 .

Protein oxidation constitutes a very minor fraction of the total fuel oxidation in any tissue. The brain and anaerobic tissues normally use carbohydrate nearly exclusively and have an RQ of $\sim 1.0$. Most tissues oxidize both carbohydrate and fat, and the RQ reflects this mixture. The whole-body RQ following an overnight fast is $\sim 0.8$ for people eating a typical Western diet; individuals with lower lipid intake have a higher RQ (i.e., approaching the value of 1 for carbohydrates).

## INTEGRATIVE METABOLISM DURING FASTING

The human body has two main priorities for energy liberation during fasting.

The first priority is to maintain a stable supply of energy for CNS function. The brain has little stored energy in the form of glycogen or TAGs and therefore depends on the liver (and under some circumstances the kidney) for a constant supply of energy in the form of glucose or ketone bodies (see p. 1185). In the fed state and early in the fasting state, the brain derives essentially all its energy from oxidation of glucose because ketone bodies are not present and the blood-brain barrier is mostly impermeable to FAs. Because a continuous supply of glucose is required to meet the energy demands of the CNS, humans have evolved elaborate, redundant mechanisms to maintain plasma [glucose] within a very narrow range, between 60 and $140 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ (3.3 to 7.8 mM ), between fasting and fed states. Lower [glucose] impairs brain function, whereas elevated plasma [glucose] exceeds the renal glucose threshold, results in polyuria, and leads to the multiple complications associated with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy).

Most other major organs of the body (liver, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney) fill their energy needs at this time by oxidizing FAs. In contrast to the well-regulated plasma [glucose], the concentrations of FAs and ketone bodies can vary by 10 - and 100 -fold, respectively, depending on the fed and fasted conditions. During prolonged fasting ( $>2$ days), the liver metabolizes FAs to raise plasma levels of ketone bodies (see p. 1185) sufficiently to supply much of the brain's oxidative fuel needs and diminish the need for gluconeogenic substrate supply by proteolysis.

The second priority for the body is to maintain its protein reserves (i.e., contractile proteins, enzymes, nervous tissue, etc.) in times of fasting.

The body also has two main priorities for energy repletion after fasting. First, following a meal, liver and muscle replenish their limited glycogen reserves. Once these stores are full, liver and muscle convert any excess energy in the form of carbohydrate and protein to fat. Muscle glycogen is the most readily available form of energy for muscle contraction, especially when intense bursts of physical activity are required. Therefore, maintaining an adequate supply of muscle glycogen at all times has obvious survival benefits in times of fight or flight. The second priority during feeding is to replenish protein reserves.

## During an overnight fast, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis maintain plasma glucose levels

The period after an overnight fast serves as a useful reference point because it represents the period before the transition from the fasted to the fed state. At this time, the concentrations of insulin, glucagon, and metabolic substrates that were altered by meal ingestion during the preceding day have returned to their basal levels. Moreover, the body is in a relative steady state in which the rate of release of endogenous fuels from storage depots closely matches fuel consumption.

Requirement for Glucose After an overnight fast, the decline in circulating insulin leads to a marked decrease in glucose uptake by insulin-sensitive tissues (e.g., muscle) and a shift toward the use by these tissues of FAs mobilized from fat stores. Nevertheless, the average adult continues to metabolize glucose at a rate of 7 to $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{hr}$. Total-body stores of free glucose, which exists mostly in the extracellular space, amount to only 15 to 20 g or $\sim 2$ hours' worth of glucose fuel. However, the useful glucose store is even less if we consider that the plasma [glucose]-normally $\sim 90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(5.0 \mathrm{mM})$ after an overnight fast-may not fall to less than $\sim 55 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}$ $(3.0 \mathrm{mM})$ before brain function becomes abnormal. Thus, maintaining plasma [glucose] in the presence of this ongoing glucose use, particularly by the brain, requires that the body produce glucose at rates sufficient to match its ongoing consumption.

Gluconeogenesis versus Glycogenolysis Four to 5 hours after a meal (perhaps longer for a very large meal), a fall in plasma [insulin] (see pp. 1035-1050) and a rise in [glucagon] (see pp. 1050-1053) cause the liver to begin breaking down its stores of glycogen and releasing it as glucose. Moreover, both the liver and, to a lesser extent, the kidney generate glucose by gluconeogenesis. The release of glucose by these two organs is possible because they are the only two with significant amounts of pyruvate carboxylase (see p. 1176) and PEPCK (see p. 1176), as well as G6Pase (see p. 1182), which catalyzes the conversion of G6P to glucose. Net hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis each contribute $\sim 50 \%$ of whole-body glucose production during the first several hours of a fast.

Gluconeogenesis: The Cori Cycle In the first several hours of a fast, the brain consumes glucose at the rate of 4 to
$5 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{hr}$, which is two thirds the rate of hepatic glucose production ( $\sim 180 \mathrm{~g} /$ day). Obligate anaerobic tissues also metabolize glucose but convert it primarily to lactate and pyruvate. The liver takes up these products and uses gluconeogenesis to regenerate glucose at the expense of energy. The liver releases the glucose for uptake by the glucose-requiring tissues, thus completing the Cori cycle (Fig. 58-13).

Gluconeogenesis: The Glucose-Alanine Cycle After an overnight fast, the body as a whole is in negative nitrogen balance, with muscle and splanchnic tissues being the principal sites of protein degradation and release of amino acids into the blood. Alanine and glutamine, which are particularly important, represent $\sim 50 \%$ of total amino acid released by muscle, even though these amino acids represent only $10 \%$ to $13 \%$ of total amino acids in muscle protein. The reason that alanine and glutamine are overrepresented is that muscle synthesizes them (see Fig. 58-13). During fasting, breakdown of muscle protein yields amino acids, which subsequently transfer their amino groups to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (supplied by the citric acid cycle) to form glutamate. Glutamine synthase can then add a second amino group to glutamate, thereby producing glutamine. Alternatively, alanine aminotransferase can transfer the amino group of glutamate to pyruvate (the product of glucose breakdown), generating alanine and $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. Both glutamine and alanine enter the blood. The intestine uses some of the glutamine as an oxidative fuel and releases the amino groups into portal blood as either alanine or ammonia.

The amino acids taken up by the liver provide carbon for gluconeogenesis. On a molar basis, alanine is the principal amino acid taken up by the liver. In the first several hours of fasting, the liver principally uses alanine for gluconeogenesis (see p. 1176). Because the carbon backbone of alanine came from glucose metabolism in muscle, and the liver regenerates glucose from this alanine, the net effect is a glucose-alanine cycle between muscle and liver, analogous to the Cori cycle.

In addition to playing a role in gluconeogenesis, the glucose-alanine cycle is critical for nitrogen metabolism and thus provides a nontoxic alternative to ammonia for transferring amino groups-derived from muscle aminoacid catabolism-to the liver (see Fig. 58-13). The hepatocytes now detoxify the amino groups on alanine and other amino acids by generating urea (see Fig. 46-14), which the kidney then excretes (see Fig. 36-1). Another key amino acid in nitrogen metabolism is glutamine, which muscle releases into the blood for uptake by the gut and liver as well as the kidney. The kidney uses the carbon skeleton of glutamine for renal gluconeogenesis and converts the amino group to ammonia, which it excretes (see pp. 829-831). This ammonia excretion is particularly important in maintaining body acid-base balance during fasting. Combined, alanine and glutamine account for $>40 \%$ of the amino-acid carbon used by liver and kidneys in gluconeogenesis.

Neither the Cori cycle nor the glucose-alanine cycle in muscle yields new carbon skeletons. Rather, both cycles transfer energy-and the glucose-alanine cycle also transfers nitrogen-between muscle and liver. The energy for hepatic glucose synthesis comes from oxidation of fat in the liver.

Lipolysis Finally, the fall in plasma [insulin] after an overnight fast permits the release of FAs and glycerol from fat stores (see Fig. 51-10). This response appears to be more pronounced in visceral than peripheral fat depots. The decline in [insulin] and the ensuing lipolysis are sufficient to supply FAs to extracerebral tissues (e.g., muscle, heart, liver) for fuel and glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. However, these changes are not sufficient to stimulate the hepatic conversion of FA to ketone bodies (see pp. 1185-1187).

The body never completely suppresses gluconeogenesis. When an individual ingests a meal, gluconeogenic flux provides glucose for hepatic glycogen stores (indirect pathway; see p. 1179). During fasting, the liver redirects the gluconeogenic flux to provide glucose for delivery to the circulation.

## Starvation beyond an overnight fast enhances gluconeogenesis and lipolysis

We have just seen that, during an overnight fast, glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis contribute about equally to maintain a fasting plasma [glucose] of $\sim 90 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dL}(5.0 \mathrm{mM})$. What happens if we extend our fast for 1 or 2 days? Because the glucose utilization rate is 7 to $10 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{hr}$, if half of this were provided by glycogenolysis (as is true for an overnight fast; see p. 1189), the hepatic glycogen stores of $\sim 70 \mathrm{~g}$ that remain after an overnight fast would be sufficient to last only an additional day. However, in the early stages of starvation, the body compensates by accelerating gluconeogenesis.

Orchestrating the metabolic adaptations in the early stages of starvation-increased gluconeogenesis, but also increased proteolysis and lipolysis-are a decline in [insulin] to a level lower than that seen after an overnight fast and a modest increase in portal vein [glucagon]. Insulin deficiency promotes all aspects of the metabolic response, whereas the effect of glucagon is mostly confined to the liver (see pp. 1050-1053).

Enhanced Gluconeogenesis Adaptations in both liver and muscle are responsible for increasing gluconeogenesis (see Fig. 58-13). In muscle, acceleration of proteolysis leads to the release of alanine and other glycogenic amino acids, whereas the liver accelerates its conversion of gluconeogenic amino acids into glucose. This enhanced gluconeogenesis, however, is not the result of increased availability of substrates, because plasma levels of alanine and other glycogenic amino acids decline. Instead, fasting increases transport of alanine into the liver and upregulates key gluconeogenic enzymes (see p. 1176), which makes gluconeogenesis more efficient.

The dependence of gluconeogenesis on proteolysis is reflected by an increase in urinary nitrogen excretion in the early phase of starvation. During the first 24 hours of a fast, the average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person excretes 7 to 12 g of elemental

nitrogen in the urine, equivalent to 50 to 75 g of protein. Because tissue protein content does not exceed $20 \%$ by weight for any tissue, 50 to 75 g of protein translates to 250 to 375 g of lean body mass lost on the first day of a fast.

Enhanced Lipolysis The activation of HSL and ATGL (see p. 1182) increases release of FAs and glycerol from TAG stores in adipose tissue and muscle (see Fig. 58-13). The increased availability of glycerol provides the liver with an additional substrate for gluconeogenesis (see p. 1176) that contributes to glucose homeostasis. Moreover, the increased availability of FAs to muscle and other peripheral tissues limits their use of glucose, which preserves glucose for the CNS and other obligate glucose-utilizing tissues and diminishes the demands for gluconeogenesis and proteolysis.

Elevated levels of FAs cause insulin resistance in skeletal muscle by directly interfering with insulin activation of GLUT4 (see Fig. 58-13). Intracellular lipid intermediates (e.g., DAGs, ceramides) activate a serine/threonine kinase cascade that involves protein kinase $\mathrm{C} \theta$, which leads to increased serine phosphorylation of insulin-receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1; see p. 1042). This serine phosphorylation, in turn, leads to decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1, and thus to a decrease in PI3K activity, which diminishes GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane of muscle. This FA-induced decrease in insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by muscle, and the parallel increased availability of FAs as a fuel for muscle, spare glucose for other tissues (e.g., brain, renal medulla, erythrocytes) under fasting conditions. However, this adaptation may play an important pathological role in mediating the insulin resistance associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.

FAs not only have effects on muscle, but also enter the liver, where they undergo $\beta$-oxidation (see pp. 1183-1185) and generate energy. A fall in the insulin-glucagon ratio inhibits ACC (see pp. 1178-1179 and Fig. 58-7), thereby reducing levels of malonyl CoA and promoting mitochondrial FA oxidation. Thus, the hormonal changes both increase the supply of FAs and activate the enzymes necessary for FA oxidation. This $\beta$-oxidation furnishes the energy and reducing power required for gluconeogenesis. If the availability of FAs outstrips the ability of the citric acid cycle to oxidize the resulting acetyl CoA, the result may be the accumulation of ketone bodies (see p. 1185), which can serve as a fuel for the CNS as well as for cardiac and skeletal muscle.

## Prolonged starvation moderates proteolysis but accelerates lipolysis, thereby releasing ketone bodies

As the duration of fasting increases, the body shifts from using its limited protein stores for gluconeogenesis to using its relatively large energy depots in fat for ketogenesis (Fig. 58-14). Moreover, the brain shifts from oxidizing glucose to oxidizing two ketone bodies (see p. 1185), $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, to meet most of its energy requirements.

Decreased Proteolysis A fasting human could survive for only $\sim 10$ days if totally dependent on protein utilization to meet whole-body energy requirements. Thus, prolonged
survival during starvation requires a major reduction in proteolysis. Indeed, urea excretion decreases from 10 to $15 \mathrm{~g} /$ day during the initial days of a fast to $<1 \mathrm{~g} /$ day after 6 weeks of fasting. Because urea is the major obligatory osmolyte in the urine (see pp. 811-813), this reduced urea production lessens obligatory water excretion and therefore the daily water requirement. Ammonium excretion also decreases.

Decreased Hepatic Gluconeogenesis The transition from protein to lipid degradation permits humans to extend their survival time during a prolonged fast from weeks to months, as long as fat stores are available and water intake is adequate. During this transition, hepatic gluconeogenesis decreases (see Fig. 58-14), mostly because of diminished substrate delivery. During the first few weeks of a fast, muscle releases less alanine, the principal substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, so that plasma [alanine] falls markedly, to less than one third of the concentrations seen after the absorption of a meal. Indeed, during a prolonged fast, infusing a small amount of alanine causes plasma [glucose] to rise.

Increased Renal Gluconeogenesis Whereas hepatic gluconeogenesis falls, renal gluconeogenesis rises (see Fig. 58-14) to reach as much as $40 \%$ of whole-body glucose production. Renal gluconeogenesis, which consumes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(see Fig. 39-5A), most likely is an adaptation to the acidosis that accompanies ketogenesis (see p. 1185). Indeed, acidosis stimulates renal ammoniagenesis in parallel with renal gluconeogenesis.

Increased Lipolysis and Ketogenesis During the first 3 to 7 days of fasting, hypoinsulinemia accelerates the mobilization of FAs from adipose tissue. As a result, plasma FA levels double and remain stable thereafter. The combination of low insulin and high glucagon levels also increases hepatic oxidation of FAs, leading to a marked increase of hepatic ketogenesis (see Fig. 58-14 and pp. 1051-1053) or ketogenic capacity. The liver achieves peak rates of ketone body production ( $\sim 100 \mathrm{~g} /$ day) by the third day and maintains them thereafter. Low insulin levels also progressively reduce the extraction of ketone bodies by peripheral tissues. Thus, despite relatively stable rates of ketone body production, circulating levels of ketone bodies continue to rise throughout the next few weeks. As a result, the CNS receives an increasing supply of these water-soluble substrates, which eventually account for more than one half of the brain's energy requirements. In this way, ketone bodies ultimately supplant the brain's dependency on glucose. Thus, by limiting the brain's gluconeogenic demands, the body preserves protein stores. Besides the CNS, other body tissues, especially the heart and skeletal muscle, can use ketone bodies to cover a significant proportion of their energy demands.

As the fast progresses and fat stores are depleted, levels of leptin (see pp. 1001-1002) decrease. This decrease in leptin levels is a protective signal that profoundly affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, reducing the oscillations of luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone and causing anovulation. In times of famine, this mechanism protects fertile women from the additional nutritional demands associated with pregnancy.

In summary, the body has evolved powerful adaptive mechanisms that ensure adequate substrate supply in the form of glucose and ketone bodies during a prolonged fast to maintain adequate CNS function. Even during a prolonged fast, humans do not lose consciousness because of decreased substrate supply to the brain. Instead, death under these conditions typically occurs when fat stores are depleted and severe protein wasting causes failure of respiratory
muscles, which in turn leads to atelectasis and terminal pneumonia.

# REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE 

Shaun F. Morrison

## HEAT AND TEMPERATURE: ADVANTAGES OF HOMEOTHERMY

## Homeotherms maintain their activities over a wide range of environmental temperatures

The ability to regulate internal body temperature has provided higher organisms independence from the environment. Because the rates of most physical and chemical reactions depend on temperature, most physiological functions are sensitive to temperature changes. Thus, the activity levels of poikilotherms (species that do not regulate internal body temperature) generally depend on environmental temperature, whereas homeotherms (species that do regulate internal body temperature) can engage in most normal activities independent of ambient temperature. A lizard, for example, is capable of relatively less movement away from its lair on a cold, overcast day than on a hot, sunny day, whereas a prairie dog may be equally mobile on either day. An arctic fox acclimatizes to the extreme cold of winter by maintaining a thick, insulating coat that enables it to resist body cooling and minimizes the necessity to increase metabolic heat generation, which would require increased food intake.

The stable body temperature of homeotherms is the consequence of designated neural networks that incorporate both anticipatory and negative-feedback controls. This arrangement creates an internal environment in which chemical reaction rates are relatively high and optimal and avoids the pathological consequences of wide fluctuations in body temperature (Table 59-1). The fundamental thermoregulatory system includes (1) thermal sensors; (2) thermosensory afferent pathways; (3) an integration system in the central nervous system (CNS); (4) efferent pathways; and (5) thermal effectors capable of heat generation (i.e., thermogenesis), such as brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle (shivering), or effectors that modulate heat transfer, such as the circulation to the skin (which dissipates heat) and the sweat glands (which augment heat loss).

In this chapter, we describe the physical aspects of heat transfer both within the homeotherm's body and between the body and the environment. We also provide a framework for understanding the major integrative role played by the CNS in regulating body temperature and consider the physiological mechanisms involved in altering rates of heat transfer and in producing extra heat in a cold environment or during fever. Finally, we look at the consequences of extreme
challenges to the thermoregulatory mechanism, such as hypothermia, hyperthermia, and dehydration.

## Body core temperature depends on time of day, physical activity, time in the menstrual cycle, and age

Temperature is a measure of heat content. The "normal" body temperature of an adult human is $\sim 37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ but it may be as low as $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or as high as $37.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in active, healthy people. Body temperature usually refers to the temperature of the internal body core, (5) N59-1 measured under the tongue (sublingually), in the ear canal, or in the rectum. For clinical purposes, the most reliable (although the least practical) among these three is the last, because it is least influenced by ambient (air) temperature. Measurement devices range from traditional mercury-in-glass thermometers to electronic digital-read-out thermistors. Nearly all such instruments are accurate to $0.1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The least invasive approach uses an infrared thermometer to measure the radiant temperature (see p. 1196) over the temporal artery. (5) N59-1

Body core temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ ) depends on many factors that alter either the activity of the CNS thermoregulatory network or the level of metabolism and heat content of the body, including the time of day, the stage of the menstrual cycle in women, and the individual's age.

All homeotherms maintain a circadian rhythm ( $\sim 24$-hour cycle) of body temperature, with variations of $\sim 1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. In humans, body temperature is usually lowest between 3:00 and 6:00 AM and peaks at 3:00 to 6:00 PM. The circadian rhythmicity in physiological variables is governed by groups of neurons in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the anterior hypothalamus, whose activity is entrained by light-dark cues to a $\sim 24$-hour cycle but is independent of the sleep-wake cycle. The influence of these neurons on the CNS thermoregulatory network produces the circadian rhythmicity in body temperature.

Reproductive hormones, and the CNS circuits that govern their production, influence the CNS thermoregulatory network. Indeed, in many women, body temperature increases $\sim 0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ during the postovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle (see pp. 1110-1111). An abrupt increase in body temperature of $0.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $0.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ accompanies ovulation and may be useful as a fertility guide.

Infants and older people are less able than other age groups to maintain a stable normal body temperature, particularly in the face of external challenges. Newborns do not

# N59-1 Body Core Temperature 

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

As noted in the text, the term body temperature usually refers to the temperature of the body core. Like effective circulating volume, body core temperature is a concept that is difficult to define with precision. The body core is generally understood to refer to internal organs, including the central blood volume that equilibrates with the core. Thus, the core includes the brain (the location of the central temperature sensors, which are in the hypothalamus), the heart, and other organs that are insulated from the environment and that produce heat at a relatively constant rate. However, the body core clearly excludes potential heat generators whose heat output varies with time, such as skeletal muscle and liver. Likewise, the body core also excludes the skin and portions of the upper airways (see p. 600), which are at the mercy of the environment.

TABLE 59-1 Consequences of Deviations in Body Temperature

| TEMPERATURE ( ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) | CONSEQUENCE |
| :-- | :-- |
| $40-44$ | Heat stroke with multiple organ <br> failure and brain lesions |
| $38-38$ | Hyperthermia (as a result of fever or <br> exercise) |

readily shiver or sweat and have a high surface-to-mass ratio, which renders them more susceptible to fluctuations in core temperature when exposed to hot or cold environments. However, they have large deposits of brown adipose tissue, which the sympathetic nervous system can stimulate to generate heat for cold defense. Moreover, newborns can implement a modest degree of sympathetic vasoconstriction of the skin to reduce heat loss in the cold.

Older people are also subject to greater fluctuations in core temperature. Aging is associated with a progressive deficit in the ability to sense heat and cold (see p. 1244), as well as reduced ability to generate heat (reduced metabolic rate and metabolic potential because of lower muscle mass) and to dissipate heat (reduced cardiovascular reserve and sweat gland atrophy from disuse).

## The body's rate of heat production can vary from $\sim 70 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ at rest to $600 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ during exercise

Because the chemical reactions are inefficient, cellular functions produce heat (see p. 1173). The body's rate of heat production depends on the rate of energy consumption and thus of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ because nearly all energy substrates derived from food are oxidized. Minor variations occur, depending on the mixture of fuels (foods) being oxidized, a process that determines the respiratory quotient ( $\mathrm{RQ}$; see p. 681 and Table 58-6).

The body's metabolic rate, and thus its rate of heat production, is not constant. The resting metabolic rate (RMR; see p. 1170) is the energy consumption necessary to maintain the basal functions of resting cells, such as active solute transport across membranes as well as the activity of cardiac and respiratory muscles necessary for organismal survival. RMR is influenced by age, sex, circadian phase, season, digestive state, phylogeny, body size, and habitat. Voluntary or involuntary (e.g., postural and shivering) muscular activity adds to the overall metabolic heat production. Even digesting a meal increases the metabolic rate (see p. 1179). An increase in tissue temperature itself raises the metabolic rate, according to the van't Hoff relation (i.e., a $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ increase in tissue temperature more than doubles the metabolic rate). Furthermore, certain hormones, notably thyroxine and epinephrine, increase the cellular metabolic rate. At an RQ of 0.8 (see p. 681 and Table 58-6), the average person under sedentary (i.e., RMR) conditions has a resting $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, which corresponds to an energy production of
$72 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ ( $\sim 85$ watts). Because the body at RMR, by definition, performs no work on the environment, all of this energy production ultimately is dissipated as heat-as if the body were a zero-efficiency, 85 -watt incandescent light bulb.

During physical exercise, the rate of energy consumptionand hence, heat generation-increases in proportion to the intensity of exercise. An average adult can comfortably sustain an energy-consumption rate of 400 to $600 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ (e.g., a fast walk or a modest jog) for extended periods. Nearly all increased heat generation during exercise occurs in active skeletal muscle, although a portion arises from increased activity of cardiac and respiratory muscles. A thermal load of this magnitude would raise core temperature by $1.0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ every 8 to 10 minutes if the extra heat could not escape the body. Physical activity would be limited to 25 to 30 minutes, at which time the effects of excessive hyperthermia $\left(>40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ would begin to impair body function. This impairment, of course, does not usually occur, primarily because of the effectiveness of the thermoregulatory heatdefense system. Within a relatively short period, the increase in body temperature resulting from exercise leads to an increased rate of heat dissipation from the skin and the respiratory system commensurate with the rate of heat production. Thereafter, the body maintains a new, but slightly elevated, steady temperature. When exercise ceases, body temperature gradually decreases to its pre-exercise level.

## MODES OF HEAT TRANSFER

## Maintaining a relatively constant body temperature requires a fine balance between heat production and heat losses

If body temperature is to remain unchanged, increases or decreases in heat production must be balanced by increases or decreases in heat loss, resulting in negligible heat storage within the body. If the body is at constant mass, the whole-body heat-balance equation expresses this concept as follows:
![bo20091984b7](bo20091984b7.jpg)

All terms in the foregoing equation have the units $\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$.
Several physiological processes contribute to temperature homeostasis, including modulation of metabolic heat production, physical heat transfer, and elimination of heat. These processes operate at the level of cells, tissues, and organ systems. Let us discuss in order the terms in Equation 59-1.

Metabolism (M) is the consumption of energy from the cellular oxidation of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. For an athlete, the useful work on the environment (W) might be the energy imparted to an iron ball during the shot put event. However, because of a long list of inefficiencies-the inherent inefficiency of metabolic transformations (see pp. 11731174) as well as frictional losses (e.g., blood flowing through vessels, air flowing through airways, tissues sliding passed

one another)-most metabolic energy consumption ends up as heat production ( $\mathrm{H}=\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{W}$ ). Table 59-2 shows the fractional contributions of different body systems to total heat production under sedentary, resting conditions.

Under conditions of maximal exercise, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {max }}}$ (see pp . 1213-1215) may correspond to a total energy expenditure ( M in Equation 59-1) of $1300 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ for an endurance athlete. If $60 \%$ of this energy evolves as heat-so that the athlete does $\sim 500 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ of useful work on the environment-the rate of heat production will be $1300-500=800 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$ ( 960 watts) for a brief period of time. This change is equivalent to changing from an 85 -watt light bulb to a 1000 -watt space heater. Unless the body can dissipate this heat, death from hyperthermia and heat stroke (Box 59-1) would ensue rapidly.

Virtually all heat leaving the body must exit through the skin surface. In the following three sections, we consider the three major routes of heat elimination: radiation (R), convection (C), and evaporation (E). As the heat-balance equation shows, the difference between heat production ( $\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{W}$ ) and heat losses $(\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{E})$ is the rate of heat storage ( S ) within the body. The value of $S$ may be positive or negative, depending on whether $(\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{W})>(\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{E})$ or vice versa. A positive value of $S$ results in a rise of $T_{\text {max }}$, such as during exercise, whereas a negative value of $S$ results in a fall in $T_{\text {max }}$, as would occur shortly after entering very cold water.

## BOX 59-1 Heat Stroke

As body core temperature rises, excessive cutaneous vasodilation can lead to a fall in arterial pressure (see p. 576) and, therefore, to a decrease in brain perfusion. As $T_{\text {max }}$ approaches $41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, confusion and, ultimately, loss of consciousness occur. Excessive hyperthermia $\left(>41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ leads to the clinical condition known as heat stroke. High temperature can cause fibrinolysis and consumption of clotting factors and thus disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), which results in uncontrolled vascular thrombosis and hemorrhage. Heat-induced damage to the cell membranes of skeletal and myocardial muscle leads to rhabdomyolysis (in which disrupted muscle cells release their intracellular contents, including myoglobin, into the circulation) and myocardial necrosis. Cell damage may also cause acute hepatic insufficiency and pancreatitis. Renal function, already compromised by low renal blood flow, may be further disrupted by the high plasma levels of myoglobin. Ultimately, CNS function is affected by the combination of high brain temperature, DIC, and metabolic disturbances.

## Heat moves from the body core to the skin, primarily by convection

Generally, all heat production occurs within the body's tissues, and all heat elimination occurs at the body surface. Figure 59-1 illustrates a passive system in which heat flows depend on the size, shape, and composition of the body, as well as on the laws of physics. The circulating blood carries heat away from active tissues, such as muscle, to the body core-represented by the heart, lungs, and their central circulating blood volume. (5) N59-2 How does the body prevent its core from overheating? The answer is that the core transfers this heat to a dissipating heat sink. The organ serving as the body's greatest potential heat sink is the relatively cool skin, which is the largest organ in the body. Only a minor amount of the body's generated heat flows directly from the underlying body core to the skin by conduction across the body tissues. Most of the generated body heat flows in the blood-by convection-to the skin, and blood flow to the skin can increase markedly during heat defense. There, nearly all heat transferred to the skin will flow to the environment, as discussed in the next section.

The transfer of heat from core to skin occurs by two routes:
$\left[\begin{array}{l}\text { Heat } \\ \text { transfer } \\ \text { from core } \\ \text { to skin }\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{l}\text { Heat } \\ \text { passively conducted } \\ \text { from core to } \\ \text { skin }\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{l}\text { Heat } \\ \text { convected by blood } \\ \text { from core to } \\ \text { skin }\end{array}\right]$

Both the conduction and convection terms in the previous equation are proportional to the temperature gradient
![bo21091984b7](bo21091984b7.jpg)

Figure 59-1 Passive or unregulated heat transfer. In the steady state, the rate of heat production by the body core must match the flow of heat from the core to the skin, and from the skin to the environment. Certain CNS commands that are not directly involved in temperature regulation can affect heat flow. Examples include CNS signals that initiate sweating in response to hypoglycemia, changes in blood flow patterns in response to a fall in blood pressure, and changes in metabolism in response to alterations in thyroid metabolism.

# N59-2 Heat Transfer from Muscle to Body Core 

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

In the simplest analysis, the rate of heat transfer from any tissue to the blood depends on (1) the rate of tissue energy production, (2) the temperature of the tissue, (3) the temperature of the incoming blood, and (4) blood flow through the tissue.

Inactive skeletal muscle, for example, has a low blood flow and a correspondingly low rate of metabolism. The rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$-a measure of metabolic rate-averages 1.5 to 2.0 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed per minute for each kilogram of muscle tissue. Because the temperature of resting muscle ( $33^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) is lower than that of the body core $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, heat flows from arterial blood to inactive skeletal muscle. A similar analysis shows that heat moves from a highly active tissue such as the liver $\left(38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ to the blood, which distributes the heat to the other tissues of the body core.

The body's greatest potential heat source is skeletal muscle, which has a relatively large mass and can increase its rate of heat production $>100$-fold. Because skeletal muscle has such potential, it is useful for modeling heat transfer and changes in tissue temperature (eFig. 59-1). The energy balance equation for skeletal muscle is as follows:
![bo22091984b7](bo22091984b7.jpg)

The three terms on the left describe all the heat that the muscle gains or loses. If they add up to a positive number, muscle temperature increases. In the steady state, these three terms add up to zero, and muscle temperature is stable.

During the onset of exercise, the heat produced by metabolism increases rapidly. If the three terms on the left side of Equation NE 59-1 sum to a very positive number (which implies a large energy excess), muscle temperature rises rapidly. However, the dramatic increase in the rate of warming is relatively short-lived
because of two factors: (1) The increase in muscle temperature reverses the temperature gradient between muscle and the blood perfusing it, so that heat now flows from muscle to blood. (2) Muscle vascular resistance decreases and cardiac output increases rapidly (see p. 581), so that blood flow through the muscle increases proportionally with the intensity of exercise. These adjustments are relatively complete within a few minutes. Increases of up to 30 -fold in blood flow account for a proportional increase in heat transfer from active muscle to blood.

As exercise continues, muscle temperature increases to a new steady-state level, which causes more heat transfer from muscle to blood. The result is an increase in core temperature as warm venous blood leaving the muscles enters the body core.

from core to skin $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}-\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}\right)$, where $\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}$ is the average skin temperature, usually obtained from at least four skin sites. The proportionality constant for passive conduction across the subcutaneous fat (the body's insulation) is relatively fixed. However, the proportionality constant for heat convection by blood is a variable term, reflecting the variability of the blood flow to the skin. The ability to alter skin blood flow, under autonomic control, is therefore the primary determinant of heat flow from core to skin. The capacity to limit blood flow to the skin is an essential defense against body cooling (hypothermia) in the cold. A side effect, however, is that skin temperature falls. Conversely, the capacity to elevate skin blood flow is an essential defense against hyperthermia. On very hot days when skin temperature may be very high and close to $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$, even high skin blood flow may not be adequate to transfer sufficient heat to allow $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ to stabilize because the temperature gradient $\left(\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}-\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}\right)$ is too small.

Although most of the heat leaving the core moves to the skin, a small amount also leaves the body core by the evaporation of water from the respiratory tract. The evaporative rate is primarily a function of the rate of ventilation (see p. 675), which in turn increases linearly with the metabolic rate over a wide range of exercise intensities.

## Heat moves from the skin to the environment by radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation

Figure 59-2 is a graphic summary of the heat-balance equation (see Equation 59-1) for an athlete exercising in an outdoor environment. This illustration depicts the movement of heat within the body, its delivery to the skin surface, and its subsequent elimination to the environment by radiation, convection, and evaporation.

Radiation Heat transfer by radiation occurs between the skin and solid bodies in the environment. The infrared portion of the electromagnetic energy spectrum carries this energy, which is why infrared cameras can detect warm bodies at night. The exchange (gain or loss) of body heat with another object by radiation occurs at a rate that is proportional to the temperature difference between the skin and the object:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { R is positive when the body loses heat and negative when it } \\
& \text { gains heat. }
\end{aligned}
$$

One may not be very aware of radiative heat fluxes to and from the body, particularly when the $\mathrm{T}_{\text {radiant }}$ differs from the ambient environmental temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {ambient }}$ ), which tends to dominate our attention. Indoors, $\mathrm{T}_{\text {radiant }}$ is the same as $\mathrm{T}_{\text {ambient }}$ because surrounding objects thermally equilibrate with one another. Outdoors, radiating bodies may be at widely different temperatures. The radiant heat load from the sun to the body on a cloudless summer day may exceed the RMR by a
![bo24091984b7](bo24091984b7.jpg)

Figure 59-2 Model of energy transfer between the body and the environment.
considerable amount. The radiant heat load from a fire or a radiant lamp can provide substantial warming of bodies in the radiant field. Conversely, on a winter evening, the radiant heat loss from the body to a cloudless, dark sky-which has a low radiant temperature-may exceed RMR. Thus, one may feel a sudden chill when walking past an uncurtained window. This chill is caused by the sudden fall in skin temperature owing to increased radiant heat loss. Radiation of heat from the body accounts for $\sim 60 \%$ of heat lost when the body is at rest in a neutral thermal indoor environment. A neutral thermal environment is a set of conditions (air temperature, airflow and humidity, and temperatures of surrounding radiating surfaces) in which the temperature of the body does not change when the subject is at rest (i.e., RMR) and is not shivering.

Conduction Heat transfer by conduction occurs when the body touches a solid material of different temperature. For example, lying on the hot sand causes one to gain heat by conduction. Conversely, placing an ice pack on a sore muscle causes heat loss by conduction. However, under most normal circumstances (e.g., when one is standing and

wearing shoes or recumbent and wearing clothes), the heat gain or loss by conduction is minimal.

Convection Heat transfer by convection occurs when a medium such as air or water carries the heat between the body and the environment. The convective heat loss is proportional to the difference between skin and ambient temperature:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Rate of } \quad \text { Convective } \quad \text { Mean } \quad \text { Ambient } \quad \text { Body surface } \\
& \text { convective heat- } \quad \text { temp } \quad \text { temp } \quad \text { heat-exchange } \\
& \text { loss } \quad \text { coefficient } \\
& \frac{C}{\frac{k c a l}{h r}}=\underbrace{h_{\text {convective }}}_{\frac{\text { kcal }}{\text { hr } \times{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \times m^{2}}}, \underbrace{\left(\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}-T_{\text {ambient }}\right)}_{\mathrm{C}}, \underbrace{A_{\text {convective }}}_{\mathrm{m}^{2}}
\end{aligned}
$$

C is positive when the body loses heat, and negative when it gains heat.

Whereas the radiative heat-transfer coefficient ( $\mathrm{h}_{\text {radiative }}$ ) is constant, the convective coefficient ( $\mathrm{h}_{\text {convective }}$ ) is variable and can increase up to 5 -fold when air velocity is high. Thus, even when $\left(\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}-\mathrm{T}_{\text {ambient }}\right)$ is fixed, convective heat loss increases markedly as wind speed increases. In the absence of air movement, the air immediately overlying the skin warms as heat leaves the skin. As this warmer and lighter air rises off the skin, cooler ambient air replaces it and, in turn, is warmed by the skin. This is the process of natural convection. However, with forced air movement, such as by wind or a fan, the cooler "ambient" air replaces the warmer air overlying the skin more rapidly. This change increases the effective convective heat transfer from the skin, even though the temperature of the ambient air is unchanged. This is a process of forced convection, which underlies the wind chill factor.

Evaporation Humans can dissipate nearly all the heat produced during exercise by evaporating sweat (see pp. 12151216) from the skin surface. The evaporative rate is independent of the temperature gradient between skin and environment. Instead, it is proportional to the water vaporpressure gradient between skin and environment:

| Rate of evaporative heat loss | Evaporative heattransfer coefficient | $\begin{aligned} & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\ & \text { vapor } \\ & \text { pressure } \\ & \text { of skin } \end{aligned}$ | $\begin{aligned} & \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \\ & \text { vapor } \\ & \text { pressure of } \\ & \text { environment } \end{aligned}$ | Body surface area available for evaporative heat exchange |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\frac{E}{\mathrm{kcal}}$ | $=\frac{h_{\text {evaporative }}}{\frac{\text { kcal }}{\text { hr } \times m m H g \times m^{2}}}$ | $\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\text {skin }}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {ambient }}\right)}{m m H g}$ | $\frac{A_{\text {evaporative }}}{m^{2}}$ |  |

E is positive when the body loses heat by evaporation and negative when it gains heat by condensation.

The evaporation of 1 g of water removes $\sim 0.58 \mathrm{kcal}$ from the body. Because the body's sweat glands can deliver up to 30 g fluid $/ \mathrm{min}$ or $1.8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$ to the skin surface, evaporation can remove $0.58 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{g} \times 1800 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{hr}$ or $\sim 1000 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}$. Thus, under ideal conditions (i.e., when ambient humidity is sufficiently low to allow efficient evaporation), evaporation could theoretically remove nearly all the heat produced during heavy exercise (see p. 1195). As with convection, increased air
velocity over the skin increases the effective vapor-pressure gradient between skin and the overlying air because of the faster movement of water vapor away from the skin.

The efficiency of heat transfer from the skin to the environment depends on both physiological and environmental factors. If ambient humidity is high, the gradient of water vapor pressure between skin and air will be low, thereby slowing evaporation and increasing the body's tendency to accumulate excess heat during exercise. This phenomenon underlies the temperature-humidity index-or heat index. Conversely, if ambient humidity is low, as in the desert, net heat loss from the body by evaporation will occur readily, even when ambient temperature exceeds skin temperature and the body is gaining heat by radiation and convection.

When the body is immersed in water, nearly all heat exchange occurs by convection, because essentially no exchanges can occur by radiation or evaporation. Because of the high conductivity and thermal capacity of water, the heat-transfer coefficient $\left(\mathrm{h}_{\text {convective }}\right)$ is $\sim 100$ times greater than that of air, so that the rate of body heat exchange is much greater in water than it is in air. It is therefore not surprising that nearly all the deaths in the Titanic shipwreck disaster resulted from hypothermia in the cold Atlantic waters, rather than from drowning.

## When heat gain exceeds heat loss, body core temperature rises

With a knowledge of the transfer coefficients- $\mathrm{h}_{\text {radiative }}$ (see Equation 59-3), $\mathrm{h}_{\text {convective }}$ (see Equation 59-4), and $\mathrm{h}_{\text {evaporative }}$ (see Equation 59-5)-and the gradients of temperature and water vapor pressure between the skin and environment, we can calculate the body heat fluxes (R, C, and E). Knowing M (computed from $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by indirect calorimetry, see pp. 10111012) and W (if any), we can use the heat-balance equation (see Equation 59-1) to calculate the rate of heat storage. From this value, we can predict the rate of change in mean body temperature:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\Delta \overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {body }}}{\Delta \mathrm{t}}=\frac{\text { Rate of heat storage }}{\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{~T}}}=\frac{0.83}{\text { Specific }} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{BW}}{\text { Body }} \\
& \text { heat of weight } \\
& \text { body } \\
& \text { tissues } \\
& \text { kcal } / \mathrm{hr} \\
& \left.\frac{\mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{hr}}{\mathrm{kcal} /\left(\mathrm{kg}^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)\right] \times \mathrm{kg}}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can verify the accuracy of this predicted rate of change in $\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {body }}$ (59-3 by comparing it to the $\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {body }}$ measured by direct thermometry, using a weighted average of the measured $\mathrm{T}_{\text {con }}$ and average $\mathrm{T}_{\text {skin }}$.

The body has to deal with two types of heat load that tend to make its temperature rise. In the heat-balance equation (see Equation 59-1), the term ( $\mathrm{M}-\mathrm{W}$ ) constitutes an internal heat load. Although the term $(\mathrm{R}+\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{E})$ normally reflects a net heat loss from the body, it can also be a net heat gain by the body-an external heat load, which can occur if either the radiation $(\mathrm{R})$ or convection $(\mathrm{C})$ terms are heat gains rather than heat losses. Thus, if we stand in the sun and $\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {radiant }}$ exceeds $\overline{\mathrm{T}}_{\text {skin }}$ (see Equation 59-3), we experience a

# N59-3 Mean Body Temperature 

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

It is difficult to make an accurate determination of mean body temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {beds }}$ ). An approximation is that mean body temperature is $0.67 \mathrm{~T}_{\text {con }}+0.33 \mathrm{~T}_{\text {des }}$ in cold conditions, and 0.9 $\mathrm{T}_{\text {con }}+0.1 \mathrm{~T}_{\text {des }}$ in warm conditions. $\mathrm{T}_{\text {con }}$ is measured directly from the rectum (or esophagus), and $\mathrm{T}_{\text {des }}$ is the average skin temperature.

radiant heat load. If we stand in a hot sauna and $\mathrm{T}_{\text {arithism }}$ exceeds $\mathrm{T}_{\text {app }}$ (see Equation 59-4), we experience a convective heat load. Clearly, both internal and external heat loads can result in net heat storage and thus a rise in body temperature. Changes in environmental temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {radiant }}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\text {arithism }}$ ) exert their influence from the outside, through the body surface. If, starting from relatively low values, $\mathrm{T}_{\text {radiant }}$ or $\mathrm{T}_{\text {arithism }}$ rises, at first the rate at which heat leaves the body decreases, so core temperature tends to rise. Further increases in environmental temperature produce a frank heat load rather than a loss.

For the athlete, all the terms of the heat-balance equation are important because dissipating the thermal load is essential for prolonging exercise. The clinician must understand these principles to treat thermally related illnesses. For example, excessive heat exposure can lead to heat exhaustion, in which $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ rises to as high as $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ if the body cannot dissipate the heat load. Failure of the body's heat-defense mechanisms arises principally from dehydration (which reduces sweating) and hypovolemia (which reduces blood flow from muscle to core to skin). Heat exhaustion is the most common temperature-related abnormality in athletes. In more severe cases, excessive heat can lead to heat stroke (see Box 59-1), in which $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ rises to $41^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or more, due to impaired thermoregulatory mechanisms.

## Clothing insulates the body from the environment and limits heat transfer from the body to the environment

Placing one or more layers of clothing between the skin and the environment insulates the body and retards heat transfer between the core and the environment. In the presence of clothing, heat transfer from a warmer body to a cooler environment occurs by the same means as without clothing (i.e., radiation, conduction, convection, and evaporation), but from the clothing surface rather than from the skin surface. The insulating effect of clothing is described by the clo unit. By definition, 1 clo is the insulation necessary to maintain a resting person at a thermal steady state in comfort at $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with minimal air movement. Obviously, clo units increase with a greater area of skin coverage by clothing, or with thicker clothing.

## ACTIVE REGULATION OF BODY TEMPERATURE BY THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM

Dedicated neural circuits in the CNS actively regulate body temperature. The central thermoregulatory network includes the following:

1. Afferent neurons that are the skin and visceral thermoreceptors
2. Thermal afferent pathways within the CNS
3. The thermoregulatory integration center in the preoptic anterior hypothalamus (5) N59-4
4. Efferent pathways providing autonomic and somatomotor inputs to effectors
5. Thermal effectors that control heat transfer between the body and environment, and that control heat production by the body

This central thermoregulatory network is an active system that is superimposed on, and regulates, the passive poikilothermic system described on pages 1194-1198, in which the circulatory system and the laws of physics determine heat transfer between the body core and the environment.

## Thermoreceptors in the skin and temperature-sensitive neurons in the hypothalamus respond to changes in their local temperature

Skin-temperature receptors, although ideal for sensing changes in environmental temperature, do not serve well during exercise because internal temperatures would rise to intolerably high levels before the skin temperature rose to allow them to detect this excess heat. Temperature-sensitive neurons in the brain, in contrast, although ideal for detecting changes in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$, are inadequate for sensing changes in the environmental temperature. Because of the thermal inertia of the body's mass, the lag time in using sensors of $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ to detect externally induced changes in temperature would be too great to achieve effective regulation. Not surprisingly, then, the body is endowed with temperature sensing neurons in both the periphery and in the CNS. The integration of their signals within the CNS central thermoregulatory network permits a rapid and effective balance of heat loss and heat production that normally maintains $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ within relatively narrow limits.

Skin Thermoreceptors The body has specialized sensory neurons (thermoreceptors) that provide the CNS with information about the thermal condition of the skin. The thermosensitive elements of thermoreceptors are free nerve endings that are distributed over the entire skin surface and contain cation channels that alter their conductance as the environmental temperature rises (TRPV1 to TRPV4 channels; see p. 386) or falls (TRPM8 channels; see p. 386). Peripheral thermoreceptors fall into two categories-warmth receptors and cold receptors (Fig. 59-3). Each type is anatomically distinct and each innervates definable warmth- or cold-sensitive spots on the skin surface (see p. 386). Thermal discrimination varies over the surface of the body; it is

# N59-4 Preoptic Area and Anterior Hypothalamus 

Contributed by Shaun Morrison, edited by Alisha Bouzaher
Inconsistent findings have led to debate among anatomists regarding the exact anatomical location of the preoptic area. Overall, the literature tends to suggest that the preoptic area is located in the anterior hypothalamus rather than anterior to the hypothalamus. A neutral view would be that the preoptic area lies immediately anterior to the optic chiasm.

coarsest on the body trunk and limbs, and finest on the face, lips, and fingers. Warmth receptors increase their steady firing rate as local skin temperature increases from $\sim 32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ up to $\sim 45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (see Fig. 59-3). Cold receptors, which are the predominant type of skin thermoreceptor, characteristically increase their steady firing rate as local temperature decreases from $\sim 40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ down to $26^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Both receptors respond to step changes in temperature with an initial, temporary change (i.e., phasic or dynamic response), followed by a stable change in the sensor's firing rate (i.e., tonic or static response; see Fig. 15-28).

Because of their location, skin thermoreceptors primarily provide the hypothalamic thermoregulatory center with information about ambient temperature (Fig. 59-4), although their discharge rate also depends on the temperature of the blood perfusing the skin. As discussed on page 1200, skin thermoreceptors provide an anticipatory (feed-forward) signal, relaying information on changes in ambient temperature to the central thermoregulatory network, which drives reflex thermoregulation and thereby minimizes changes in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$. Information from skin thermoreceptors also travels through thalamic pathways to the cerebral cortex, thus providing the basis for conscious perception of the thermal environment. Therefore, we can localize thermal stimuli on the skin surface and have an appreciation of thermal comfort. This thalamocortical pathway may be responsible for triggering behavioral thermoregulation; for example, moving from the sun to the shade when we feel too hot (see p. 1224).

Hypothalamic Temperature-Sensitive Neurons The principal mechanism through which the central thermoregulatory network senses changes in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ is via temperature-sensitive neurons in the preoptic area of the anterior hypothalamus (see Fig. 47-3), (T) NS9-4 where $\sim 10 \%$ of neurons are warmth sensitive (i.e., their discharge rate increases as local temperature rises). As in skin thermoreceptors, TRPV channels endow preoptic temperature-sensitive neurons with the ability to change their discharge rate as the temperature of their local environment changes. The temperature-sensitive neurons in the preoptic area play the major role in detecting changes in deep body temperature (see Fig. 59-4). Sensing of $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ by preoptic temperature-sensitive neurons is especially important during exercise, intake of hot fluids, or the resolution of a fever. In these conditions, heat storage increases more rapidly than heat dissipation, a situation calling for a prompt increase in heat loss to avoid a significant increase in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$.

## The CNS thermoregulatory network integrates thermal information and directs changes in efferent activity to modify rates of heat transfer and production

Warming or cooling of the skin-via skin thermoreceptorsalters both the tonic and the phasic components of afferent neuronal activity (see Fig. 59-4). The cell bodies of the warmth receptors and cold receptors are in the dorsal root ganglia and their axons synapse in the dorsal horn on secondorder thermal sensory neurons, which project rostrally to two integration sites: (1) In the thalamus, they synapse on third-order neurons that provide somatosensory information to the cerebral cortex for conscious perception of skintemperature changes and their localization to particular areas of the skin. (2) In the parabrachial nucleus of the pons, they synapse on third-order neurons that provide autonomic sensory information to the preoptic hypothalamus. Here, fourth-order neurons integrate cutaneous-temperature information with $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ information encoded in the discharge rates of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons.

Cutaneous warmth thermoreceptors-upon exposure to a warm environment-increase the activity of warmth sensory neurons in the thermal afferent pathway and thereby stimulate the discharge of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons. Conversely, cutaneous cold sensory signals inhibit the discharge of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons. Thus, the input from the warmth and cold sensory neurons, which report $\mathrm{T}_{\text {skin }}$, shifts the discharge rate of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons away from the level otherwise determined by $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core. }}$ (5) N59-7

The preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons provide a variable level of inhibition to descending efferent pathways that otherwise would excite two types of spinal neurons: (1) sympathetic preganglionic neurons that promote cutaneous vasoconstriction (limiting heat transfer within and from the body) and brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, and (2) $\alpha$ motor neurons that cause shivering in skeletal muscle (generating heat). For example, a fall in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {skin }}$ would disinhibit the activity of the efferent pathways to the cold-defense effectors and thereby tend to increase $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$.

The efferent pathways from the preoptic area are different for each of the thermal effectors, consistent with the variety of thermal effectors and their interchangeable roles in other functions (e.g., muscles that shiver also produce net movement). Moreover, nonthermal inputs have unique effects on different efferent pathways. For instance, dehydration increases plasma osmolality, which stimulates CNS osmoreceptors (see Fig. 40-8) that can strongly inhibit the efferent pathway for sweating, so that the body conserves free water at the expense of cooling. Similarly, hypoxia (e.g., ascent to high altitude, late stages of emphysema) stimulates the arterial chemoreceptor reflex, which strongly inhibits the efferent pathways for thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, tissues with high rates of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption.

The skin receptors provide information mainly about environmental temperature, which affects the body's heat-loss rate and could ultimately cause $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ to change if the body did not initiate the appropriate thermoregulatory responses to skin cooling or warming. Thus, reflex responses driven by changes in the average skin temperature may be thought of as anticipatory or feed-forward, inasmuch as these responses
do not bring skin temperature to a regulated level because of the skin's exposure to the ambient environment. However, these anticipatory reflexes are essential elements for an effective thermoregulatory system because the body's thermal inertia is too great to rely on central receptors alone. For example, low skin temperature, which is lowered still further by cutaneous vasoconstriction in the cold, ensures a rapid and continuous cold signal that maintains a drive for cutaneous vasoconstriction, brown adipose thermogenesis, and shivering. Conversely, thermoregulatory responses to changes in core (i.e., hypothalamic) temperature exhibit negative feedback. (5) N1-1 For example, during exercise, the increase in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ directly increases the discharge of the preoptic warmthsensitive neurons; this increased discharge causes them to decrease the intensity of heat retention and heat generation, and thereby promotes a return of $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ to the regulated level.

In conclusion, $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ depends upon the balance between the active thermoregulatory system (i.e., the network from sensors to effectors) and the passive thermal elements (i.e., the overall metabolic heat load and the physical exchange of heat between the body and the environment). Presumably, human evolution of warmth-sensitive preoptic neurons has conferred the particular membrane properties and sensitivities to peripheral inputs that produce a $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ of $-37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which is optimal for cellular chemical machinery.

## Thermal effectors include behavior, cutaneous circulation, sweat glands, and skeletal muscles responsible for shivering

Humans have become quite adept at devising behavioral adaptations that permit survival in a wide range of environmental temperatures. As a thermal effector, behavior (from simply moving out of the hot sun, to building a fire, to designing a suit for space walks) is usually the central thermoregulatory system's first response to a change in environmental temperature, as sensed by skin thermoreceptors (see p. 1224). Behavior is also an essential anticipatory mechanism (e.g., putting on heavy clothing before going outside in a snowstorm) that is so habitual we do not even recognize it as part of our thermoregulatory repertoire.

The thermal effectors that modulate heat transfer are under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. Adjusting the smooth-muscle tone of cutaneous arterioles and of arteriovenous anastomoses (shunts) controls cutaneous blood flow (see pp. 570-571)-and therefore heat flowfrom the core to the skin surface, the primary site of heat dissipation to the environment. Over most of the skin, the sympathetic nervous system controls blood flow. When it is necessary to increase heat dissipation, active vasodilation can increase cutaneous blood flow up to 10 -fold above the resting level. Conversely, when it is necessary to conserve heat in a cold environment, cutaneous blood flow falls, partly by inhibition of active vasodilation and also by increased sympathetically mediated cutaneous vasoconstriction. As vasoconstriction increases, the reduced flow of warm blood through the cutaneous circulation causes skin temperature to fall even closer to ambient temperature, which results in further activation of the skin cold thermoreceptors. Even with maximal vasoconstriction in effect, heat losses to a very cold environment do not fall to zero because of a small

In the experiments on rabbits (see eFigure 59-4), the investigators implanted water-perfused thermodes to control the temperature of the preoptic area/anterior hypothalamus (POAH), shown on the $x$-axis. Metabolic rate, shown on the $y$-axis, was calculated from $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{Gl}}$, and the animals were placed in a temperaturecontrolled chamber. Mean skin temperature (three different symbols) was also measured. eFigure 59-4 demonstrates how changes in ambient (skin) temperatures $\left(T_{\text {skin }}\right)$ affects the POAH gain (the slope of a fitted line). This gain was determined by plotting the metabolic responses to brief step changes in the POAH temperature away from its normal level of $39.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (vertical dashed line in the figure). The POAH gain is flattest at the warmest skin temperature $\left(T_{\text {skin }}=34.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and it is steepest at the coldest skin temperature $\left(T_{\text {skin }}=30.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. It can also be seen that when hypothalamic temperature is left undisturbed at its normal level of $39.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the metabolic rate is at resting level ( $3.0 \mathrm{watt} / \mathrm{kg}$ ) when $\mathrm{T}_{\text {skin }}$ is $34.3^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (i.e., with the subject in a relatively warm room). On the other hand, when $T_{\text {skin }}$ is $30.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (i.e., with the subject in a cooler room), the metabolic rate rises to $>6.0 \mathrm{watt} / \mathrm{kg}$, due to the shivering thermogenesis induced by the low skin temperatures.

thermal conductance of the body's tissues to the skin surface and a temperature difference between the skin and the environment.

Piloerection reduces the rate of heat loss by retaining a layer of warm air next to the skin and occurs by activation of the sympathetic input to smooth muscles in the hair follicles. Although the thermoregulatory benefit of piloerection waned as humans lost their thick fur, the central thermoregulatory circuits and sympathetic innervation of hair follicles maintain this vestigial reflex response to cold.

With a moderate heat load, the autonomic response primarily increases heat transfer from core to skin by elevating cutaneous blood flow. However, when the heat load is sufficiently great, the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons also drive activation of the eccrine sweat glands (see pp. 12151216), which secrete sweat onto the skin surface. Sweating elevates the partial pressure of water vapor at the skin surface and promotes increased evaporation, which takes heat from the skin. The innervation of the secretory segment of the sweat gland is sympathetic, but it is unusual in that acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter (see p. 342). Because sweating can lead to the loss of large amounts of water ( $>1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$ ) and electrolytes, adequate hydration in hot environments is essential to prevent circulatory collapse and fatal hyperthermia (see Box 59-1).

As cold stress increases, cutaneous vasoconstriction is supplemented with heat production-thermogenesis-initially in brown adipose tissue and subsequently through shivering. The sympathetic nervous system heavily innervates brown adipocytes (see pp. 1164-1166), releasing norepinephrine onto $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic receptors. The subsequent oxidation of fatty acids leads to the production not of ATP but of heat by virtue of the uncoupling protein UCP1 (see pp. 1013 and 1166) and the abundant mitochondria. This thermogenesis depends on the size of the brown adipose tissue depots and the sympathetic input. Substantial brown adipose tissue depots have long been recognized in small rodents, hibernating animals, and human infants. However, the demonstration of brown adipose tissue in adult humans-and, in particular, its relative absence in the obese-has stimulated research into its potential role in metabolic homeostasis.

Shivering begins with an often-unrecognized increase in basal skeletal muscle tone, followed by the familiar involuntary, clonic, rhythmic contractions and relaxations of skeletal muscles. Shivering can triple or quadruple the metabolic rate for brief intervals and double the metabolic rate for extended periods (hours) before fatigue occurs. The same $\alpha$ motor neurons that innervate skeletal muscle for normal body movement and posture also drive shivering, but the mechanism underlying the rhythmic activations of $\alpha$ motor neurons during shivering is unknown.

## HYPOTHERMIA, HYPERTHERMIA, AND FEVER

## Hypothermia or hyperthermia occurs when heat transfer to or from the environment overwhelms the body's thermoregulatory capacity

Although the body's temperature-regulating machinery is impressive, its capabilities are not limitless. Any factor that causes sufficiently large shifts-either negative or positivein the rate of heat storage (see Equation 59-1) could result in progressive hypothermia or hyperthermia (see Equation 59-6). Because humans must operate within a fairly narrow core-temperature range, such temperature changes could become life-threatening.

The most common environmental condition causing excessive hypothermia is prolonged immersion in cold water. Water has a specific heat per unit volume that is $\sim 4000$ times that of air and a thermal conductivity that is $\sim 25$ times that of air. Both properties contribute to a convective heattransfer coefficient ( $\mathrm{h}_{\text {convective }}$ in Equation 59-4) that is $\sim 100$ fold greater in water than it is in air. The $\mathrm{h}_{\text {convective }}$ is $\sim 200 \mathrm{kcal} /$ (hr $\cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2}$ ) at rest in still water but $\sim 500 \mathrm{kcal} /\left(\mathrm{hr} \cdot{ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ while swimming. The body's physiological defenses against hypothermia include peripheral vasoconstriction (which increased insulation) and shivering (which increases heat production), but even these measures do not prevent hypothermia during prolonged exposure because of water's high thermal conductivity. A thick layer of insulating fat retards heat loss to the water and postpones or even prevents hypothermia during prolonged exposures. Endurance swimmers have used this knowledge to protect themselves by applying a thick layer of grease to the skin surface before an event (now, more commonly, they don a wetsuit). Herman Melville noted this principle in 1851, when he referred to the low thermal conductivity of fat:

For the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket. ... It is by reason of this cozy blanketing that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all seas. ... this great monster, to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man.
—Moby Dick
Like blubber, clothing adds insulation between skin and environment and thus reduces heat loss during exposure to the cold. The more skin one covers, the more one reduces the surface area for direct heat loss from skin to environment by convection and radiation. Adding layers of clothing increases the resistance of heat flow by trapping air, which is an excellent insulator. During heat exposure, the major avenue for heat loss is evaporation of sweat. Because evaporation also depends on the surface area available, the amount of clothing should be minimized. Wetting the clothing increases the rate of heat loss from the skin because water is a better conductor than air. Water also can evaporate from the clothing surface, which removes heat from the outer layers and increases the temperature gradient (and rate of heat loss) from skin to clothing.

The most common environmental condition that results in excessive hyperthermia is prolonged simultaneous exposure to heat and high ambient humidity, particularly when accompanied by physical activity (i.e., elevated heatproduction rate). The ability to dissipate heat by radiation falls as the radiant temperature of nearby objects increases (see Equation 59-3), and the ability to dissipate heat by convection falls as ambient temperature increases (see Equation 59-4). When ambient temperature reaches the mid-30s $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$, evaporation becomes the only effective avenue for heat dissipation. However, high ambient humidity reduces the

skin-to-environment gradient for water vapor pressure, which reduces evaporation (see Equation 59-5). The combined reduction of heat loss by these three pathways can markedly increase the rate of heat storage (see Equation 59-6), causing progressive hyperthermia.

It is uncommon for radiative or convective heat gain to cause hyperthermia under conditions of low ambient humidity, because the body has a high capacity for dissipating the absorbed heat by evaporation. Radiative heat gain can be excessively high during full exposure to the desert sun or during exposure to heat sources such as large furnaces. The most obvious protections against radiative hyperthermia are avoiding radiant sources (e.g., sitting in the shade) and covering the skin with loose clothing. The latter screens the radiation while allowing air circulation underneath the clothing and thereby maintaining evaporative and convective losses.

## Exercise raises heat production, which is followed by a matching rise in heat loss, but at the cost of a steady-state hyperthermia of exercise

At the onset of muscular exercise, the rate of heat production increases in proportion to exercise intensity and exceeds the current rate of heat dissipation; thus, heat storage occurs and core temperature rises (Fig. 59-5). This rise in the temperature of the local environment of the preoptic warmthsensitive neurons increases their discharge rate, which increases the neural output that activates heat dissipation (see Fig. 59-4). As a result, skin blood flow and sweating increase as $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ rises, promoting an increase in the rate of heat transfer from core to environment and slowing the rate
![bo28091984b7](bo28091984b7.jpg)

at which $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ rises. However, heat dissipation during exercise does not increase enough both to eliminate the alreadyacquired heat storage and to balance the ongoing heat production. Thus, the mildly elevated steady-state $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ persists as long as exercise continues.

The elevated $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ during exercise may be one aspect of the body's "central command" for exercise and is necessary to maintain the elevated discharge of the preoptic warmthsensitive neurons in order to sustain increased activity of the thermal effectors for heat dissipation. In the example illustrated in Figure 59-5, metabolic heat production rises rapidly to its maximal level for the particular level of exercise underway. However, evaporative heat loss increases only after a delay and then rises slowly to its maximal level, driven by increasing body temperature. In this example, the result is net storage during the first 15 minutes. The slight initial drop in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ at the onset of exercise is caused by flushing out of blood from the cooler peripheral circulation when the muscle and skin beds vasodilate in response to the onset of exercise. Note also that mean skin temperature decreases during exercise because of the increased evaporative cooling of the skin caused by sweating. (○) NS9-5

## Fever is a regulated hyperthermia

Whereas hyperthermias such as that resulting from exercise in a hot environment arise from incomplete compensation by the thermoregulatory system for an imposed heat load, fever is a regulated elevation of core temperature induced by the central thermoregulatory system itself.

In response to a variety of infectious and inflammatory stimuli, macrophages and, to a lesser extent, lymphocytes release cytokines into the circulation (Fig. 59-6). Cytokines (see p. 68) are a diverse group of peptides and proteins involved in numerous tasks, among which are serving as the messenger molecules of the immune system. The first step in the host defense response is the immune response to foreign substances, including stimulation of T-lymphocyte proliferation, of natural killer cells, and of antibody production. The second is the acute-phase response, a diffuse collection of host reactions, including fever production, lethargy, and hyperalgesia, which apparently support the immunological response to, and the body's recovery from, infection or trauma. Finally, cytokines such as interleukin-1 $\beta$ (IL-1 $\beta$ ) act as endogenous pyrogens (Table 59-3) in a signaling cascade that induces peripheral (e.g., in liver) and CNS production of prostaglandin $\mathbf{E}_{2}\left(\mathbf{P G E}_{2}\right)$ see Fig. 3-11). IL-1 $\beta$, for example, could interact with the endothelial cells in a leaky portion of the blood-brain barrier (see pp. 284-287) located in the capillary bed of the organum vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT; see pp. 284-285). The OVLT is highly vascular tissue that lies in the wall of the third ventricle (above the optic chiasm) in the brain. IL-1 $\beta$ triggers endothelial cells within the OVLT to release $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, which then diffuses into the adjacent preoptic hypothalamus to drive the febrile response.

PGE $_{2}$ inhibits warmth-sensitive neurons in the preoptic area-akin to the action of stimulated skin cold thermoreceptors-and activates the thermal effectors (see pp. 1200-1201) for heat retention (cutaneous vasoconstriction) and heat production (brown adipose tissue thermogenesis, and shivering or "chills"), which results in an increase

# N59-5 Effect of Training on the Hyperthermia of Exercise 

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

Physical training reduces the hyperthermia of exercise by reducing the threshold for sweating (so that sweating begins earlier) and increasing sweating sensitivity (so that a given hypothalamic drive produces more sweating); it thus provides a greater margin of safety between operating and limiting temperatures for exercise (eFig. 59-2). To the extent that training enhances sweat gland function (evaporative heat loss), reliance on cutaneous circulation (convective heat loss) falls, while preserving blood flow to muscle. The relative dehydration caused by continuous water losses during prolonged exercise elevates the temperature threshold for sweating and reduces the sensitivity (see eFig. 59-2). The result is a higher core temperature during exercise.

in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$. This sequence is in sharp contrast to the hyperthermia of exercise, in which the rise in $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ due to muscle heat production provides a strong and unimpeded stimulus for the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons to increase the activity of the thermal effectors for heat defense. In contrast, in fever, the excitatory effect of the elevated $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ cannot compete with the strong inhibition of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons elicited by the local increase in $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$, and activation (via disinhibition) of the thermal effectors for cold defense prevails. (5) NS9-6

Once the $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ production falls-perhaps due to administration of an anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits $\mathrm{PGE}_{2}$ synthesis (see Box 3-3)-the elevated $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ can now produce
a marked stimulation of the preoptic warmth-sensitive neurons, resulting in an inhibition of the thermal effectors for heat production and a strong stimulation of those for heat loss, and the fever "breaks."

In both exercise and fever, behavioral thermoregulatory responses support those autonomic and shivering responses being directed by the neurons in the preoptic area. During exercise, one feels warm, and this deviation from thermal comfort drives behaviors such as removing clothing or splashing cold water on the body to cool it. In contrast, during the onset of a fever, one feels cold and may choose to put on additional clothing or blankets to warm the body. If fever strikes when the patient is in a hot environment in which the cutaneous vessels are dilated, cutaneous vasoconstriction will occur to reduce heat loss. In contrast, if the patient is in a cool environment in which the cutaneous vessels are already constricted, increased thermogenesis will occur in brown adipose tissue and through shivering (chills). However, because the thermal effectors activated in cold defense are the same as those activated during fever, it may be difficult to produce a significant febrile elevation of $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ in a fairly cold environment.

The value of fever in fighting infection is still debated. A popular hypothesis is that the elevated temperature enhances the host's response to infection. This view is supported by the observation that, in vitro, the rate of T-lymphocyte proliferation in response to interleukins is many-fold higher at $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ than it is at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.

# EXERCISE PHYSIOLOGY AND SPORTS SCIENCE 

Steven S. Segal

Physical exercise is often the greatest stress that the body encounters in the course of daily life. Skeletal muscle typically accounts for $30 \%$ to $50 \%$ of the total body mass. Thus, with each bout of muscular activity, the body must make rapid, integrated adjustments at the level of cells and organ systems-and must tune these adjustments over time. The subdiscipline of exercise physiology and sports science focuses on the integrated responses that enable the body to convert chemical energy into mechanical work. To understand these interdependent processes, one must appreciate where regulation occurs, the factors that determine physical performance, and the adaptations that take place with repetitive use.

The cross-bridge cycle that underlies contraction of skeletal muscle requires energy in the form of ATP (see pp. 234-236). Skeletal muscle converts only $\sim 25 \%$ of the energy stored in carbon-carbon bonds (see p. 1170) into mechanical work. The rest appears as heat, due to the inefficiencies of the biochemical reactions (see pp. 1173-1174). Thus, the dissipation of this heat is central to cardiovascular function, fluid balance, and the ability to sustain physical effort-an example of an integrated organ-system response. Moreover, because muscle stores of ATP, phosphocreatine, and glycogen are limited, the ability to sustain physical activity requires another set of integrated cellular and organ-system responses to supply $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and energy sources to active muscles.

## MOTOR UNITS AND MUSCLE FUNCTION

Chapter 9 deals with the cellular and molecular physiology of skeletal muscle contraction. In this subchapter, we examine the integration of these cellular and molecular elements into the contraction of a whole muscle.

## The motor unit is the functional element of muscle contraction

The motor unit (see pp. 228-229) is the functional unit of skeletal muscle and consists of a single motor neuron and all the muscle fibers that it activates. A typical skeletal muscle such as the biceps brachii receives innervation from $\sim 750$ somatic motor neurons.

When the motor neuron generates an action potential, all fibers in the motor unit fire simultaneously. Thus, the fineness of control for movement varies with the innervation
ratio (see pp. 228-229)-the number of muscle fibers per motor neuron. (T) N60-1 The small motor units that are recruited during sustained activity contain a high proportion of type I muscle fibers (see p. 249), which are highly oxidative and resistant to fatigue. The type IIa motor units (see p. 249) have larger innervation ratios, contract faster, and have less oxidative capacity and fatigue resistance than type I units. Still larger motor units-recruited for brief periods for rapid, powerful activity-typically consist of type IIx muscle fibers; these have less oxidative capacity (i.e., are more glycolytic) and are much more susceptible to fatigue than type IIa muscle. In practice, it may be best to view muscle fiber types and motor units as a continuum rather than distinct entities.

Within a whole muscle, muscle fibers of each motor unit intermingle with those of other motor units so extensively that a volume of muscle containing 100 muscle fibers is innervated by terminals from perhaps 50 different motor neurons. However, each muscle fiber is innervated by only one motor neuron. Within some muscles, the fibers of a motor unit are constrained to discrete compartments. This anatomical organization enables different regions of a muscle to exert force in somewhat different directions, which enables more precise control of movement.

## Muscle force rises with the recruitment of motor units and an increase in their firing frequency

During contraction, the force exerted by a muscle depends on (1) how many motor units are recruited, and (2) how frequently each of the active motor neurons fires action potentials. Motor units are recruited in a progressive order, from the smallest (i.e., fewest number of muscle fibers) and therefore the weakest motor units to the largest and strongest. This intrinsic behavior of motor-unit recruitment is known as the size principle and reflects inherent differences in the biophysical properties of respective motor neurons. For a given amount of excitatory input (i.e., depolarizing synaptic current; $I_{\mathrm{sys}}$ in Fig. 60-1), a neuronal cell body with smaller volume and surface area has a higher membrane input resistance. Therefore, the depolarizing voltage rises to threshold more quickly in a neuron with a smaller neuronal cell body than in a neuron with a larger cell body (see Fig. 60-1). Because the neurons with the small cell bodies tend to innervate a small number of slow-twitch (type I) muscle fibers, the motor units with the greatest resistance to fatigue

# N60-1 Innervation Ratio 

## Contributed by Steven Segal, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

A motor unit is a motor neuron and all of the muscle fibers that it innervates (see pp. 228-229). The innervation ratio quantifies the motor unit. The innervation ratio is the number of muscle fibers innervated by a single motor neuron. Thus, large motor units have high innervation ratios.

Muscles controlling the very fine movements of the eye (e.g., rectus lateralis) have innervation ratios of only a few muscle fibers. At the other extreme, motor units in the thigh (e.g., quadriceps muscle) and calf (e.g., gastrocnemius muscle) often contain thousands of muscle fibers and are involved in such powerful activities as sprinting and jumping. In the muscles involved in hand movements, motor units have innervation ratios that vary from $<100$ fibers (e.g., interosseous muscles controlling fine movements of the fingers) to $>1000$ fibers (e.g., forearm muscles controlling such coarse movements as grasping).

![bo32091984b7](bo32091984b7.jpg)

Figure 60-1 Size principle for motor units. Small motor neurons are more excitable, conduct action potentials more slowly, and excite fewer fibers that tend to be slow twitch (type I). Conversely, large motor neurons are less excitable, conduct action potentials more rapidly, and excite many fibers that tend to be fast twitch (type II). EPSP, excitatory postsynaptic potential; $R_{m}$, membrane resistance; $V_{m}$, membrane potential. (Adapted from Kandel ER, Schwartz JH, Jessell TM: Principles of Neural Science, 4th ed. New York, McGraw-Hill, 2000.)
are the first to be recruited. Conversely, the neurons with the larger cell bodies tend to innervate a larger number of fasttwitch (type II) fibers, so the largest and most fatigable motor units (type IIx) are the last to be recruited (e.g., during peak levels of force production). Because the relative timing of action potentials in different motor units is asynchronous, the force developed by individual motor units integrates into a smooth contraction. As a muscle relaxes, the firing of respective motor units diminishes in reverse order.

At levels of force production lower than the upper limit of recruitment, gradations in force are accomplished via concurrent changes in the number of active motor units and the firing rate of those that have been recruited-rate coding. Once all the motor units in a muscle have been recruited, any further increase in force results from an increase in firing rate. The relative contribution of motor-unit recruitment and rate coding varies among muscles. In some cases, recruitment is maximal by the time muscle force reaches $\sim 50 \%$ of maximum, whereas in others, recruitment continues until the muscle reaches nearly $90 \%$ of maximal force.

Not only do the intrinsic membrane properties of motor neurons (i.e., the size principle) affect motor neuron firing, but other neurons that originate in the brainstem project to the motor neurons and release the neuromodulatory
neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine (see Fig. 13-7A and B). For example, this neuromodulatory input, acting on the motor neurons of small, slow-twitch motor units, can promote self-sustained levels of firing of the motor neurons during the maintenance of posture. In contrast, the withdrawal of this excitatory neuromodulatory input during sleep promotes muscle relaxation. Thus, the brainstem can control the overall gain of a pool of motor neurons.

## Compared with type I motor units, type II units are faster and stronger but more fatigable

Within a given motor unit, each muscle fiber is of the same muscle fiber type. As summarized in Tables 9-1 and 9-2, the three human muscle fiber types-type I, type IIa, and type IIx-differ in contractile and regulatory proteins, the content of myoglobin (and thus color) and of mitochondria and glycogen, and the metabolic pathways used to generate ATP (i.e., oxidative versus glycolytic metabolism). Physical training can modify these biochemical properties, which determine a range of functional parameters, including (1) speeds of contraction and relaxation, (2) maximal force, and (3) susceptibility to fatigue (Fig. 60-2).

In response to an action potential evoked through the motor axon, slow-twitch (type I) motor units (see Fig. $60-2 A$, top) require relatively long times to develop moderate levels of force and return to rest. In contrast, fast-twitch (types IIa and IIx) motor units exhibit relatively short contraction and relaxation times and develop higher levels of force (see Fig. 60-2B and C, top). Accordingly, during repetitive stimulation (middle row of Fig. 60-2), slow-twitch motor units summate to a fused tetanus at lower stimulation frequencies than do fast-twitch motor units. Indeed, the $\alpha$ motor neurons in the spinal cord that drive slow motor units fire at frequencies of 10 to 50 Hz , whereas those that drive fast motor units fire at 30 Hz to $>100 \mathrm{~Hz}$.

The maximal force that can develop per cross-sectional area of muscle tissue is constant across fiber types ( 25 $\mathrm{N} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ ). Therefore, the ability of different motor units to develop active force is directly proportional to the number and diameter of fibers each motor unit contains. In accord with the innervation ratios of motor units, peak force production (middle row of Fig. 60-2) increases from type I motor units (used for fine control of movement) to type II motor units (recruited during more intense activities).

The susceptibility to fatigue of a motor unit depends on the metabolic profile of its muscle fibers. The red type I muscle fibers have a greater mitochondrial density and can rely largely on the aerobic metabolism of carbohydrate and lipid as fuel because they are well supplied with capillaries for delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrients. Type I motor units, although smaller in size (and innervation ratio), are recruited during sustained activity of moderate intensity and are highly resistant to fatigue (see Fig. 60-2A, bottom). In contrast, the larger type II motor units are recruited less often-during brief periods of intense activity-and rely to a greater extent on short-term energy stores (e.g., glycogen stored within the muscle fiber). Among type II motor units, type IIa motor units have intermediate innervation ratios, a greater mitochondrial density, a larger capacity for aerobic energy metabolism, a greater $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ supply, and a higher endurance capacity,

Note that the time scales become progressively larger from the top to bottom rows, with a break in the bottom row. Also, the tension scales become progressively larger from left (fewer fibers per motor unit) to right (more fibers per motor unit). These results are from experiments performed on cat gastrocnemius muscle, which has type IIb fibers (instead of type IIx fibers as in humans). (Data from Burke RE, Levine DN, Tsairis P, et al: J Physiol 234:723-748, 1977.)
and hence are classified as fast fatigue-resistant (bottom of Fig. 60-2B). In contrast, type IIx motor units have the highest innervation ratios and a greater capacity for rapid energy production through nonoxidative (i.e., anaerobic) glycolysis, and thus can produce rapid and powerful contractions. However, type IIx units tire more rapidly and are therefore classified as fast fatigable (see Fig. 60-2C, bottom).

## As external forces stretch muscle, series elastic elements contribute a larger fraction of total tension

As sarcomeres contract, some of their force acts laterally -through membrane-associated and transmembrane proteins-on the extracellular matrix and connective tissue that surrounds each muscle fiber. Ultimately, the force is transmitted to bone, typically (but not always) through a tendinous insertion. The structural elements that transmit force from the cross-bridges to the skeleton comprise the series elastic elements of the muscle and behave as a spring with a characteristic stiffness. Stretching resting muscle causes passive tension to increase exponentially with length (see Fig. 9-9C). Thus, muscle stiffness increases with length. During an isometric contraction (see pp. 237-238), when the external length of a muscle (or muscle fiber) is held constant, the sarcomeres shorten at the expense of stretching the series elastic elements. An isometric contraction can occur at modest levels of force development, such as holding a cup of coffee, as well as during maximal force development, such as when opposing wrestlers push and pull against each
other, with neither gaining ground. Physical activity typically involves contractions in which muscles are shortening and lengthening, as well as periods during which muscle fibers are contracting isometrically.

During cyclic activity such as running, muscles undergo a stretch-shorten cycle that may increase total tension while decreasing active tension. For example, as the calf muscles relax as the foot lands and decelerates, the series elastic elements of the calf muscles (e.g., the Achilles tendon, connective tissue within muscles) are stretched and develop increased passive tension (see Fig. 9-9C). Thus, when the calf muscles contract to begin the next cycle, they start from a higher passive tension and therefore use a smaller increment in active tension to reach a higher total tension. (T) N60-2 This increased force helps to propel the runner forward.

In a concentric contraction (e.g., climbing stairs), the force developed by the cross-bridges exceeds the external load, and the sarcomeres shorten. During a concentric contraction, a muscle performs positive work (force $\times$ distance) and produces power (work/time; see p. 240). As shown in Figure 9-9E, the muscle achieves peak power at relatively moderate loads ( $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of isometric tension) and velocities ( $30 \%$ to $40 \%$ of maximum shortening velocity). The capacity of a muscle to perform positive work determines physical performance. For example, a stronger muscle can shorten more rapidly against a given load, and a muscle that is metabolically adapted to a particular activity can sustain performance for a longer period of time before succumbing to fatigue.

# N60-2 Effect of Stretch on the Active Tension of Skeletal Muscle 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As shown in Figure 9-9D, the active tension of skeletal muscle is maximal at a sarcomere length with an optimal overlap of the thin and thick filaments. At relatively low initial lengths of the muscle (e.g., at 70 on the $x$-axis of Fig. 9-9C, D), the active tension is relatively low. Prestretching the muscle to a greater initial length produces a greater active tension ... up to a point (i.e., 100 on the $x$-axis). Further increases in passive length actually produce a decrease in active tension (e.g., 130 on the $x$-axis). Of course, the total tension increases continuously from the lowest to the highest muscle lengths.

In an eccentric contraction (e.g., descending stairs), the force developed by the cross-bridges is less than the imposed load, and the sarcomeres lengthen. During an eccentric contraction, the muscle performs negative work, thereby providing a brake to decelerate the applied force being applied, and absorbs power. Eccentric contractions can occur with light loads, such as lowering a cup of coffee to the table, as well as with much heavier loads, such as decelerating after jumping off a bench onto the floor. At the same absolute level of total force production, eccentric contractionswith increasingly stretched sarcomeres-develop less active tension than do concentric or isometric contractions. Conversely, the passive tension developed by the series elastic elements makes a greater contribution to total tension. As a result, the maximum tension generated eccentrically can be greater than that generated isometrically. When the external force stretches the muscle sufficiently, all the tension is passive and the limit is the breaking point (see Fig. 19-9B) of the series elastic elements. Thus, eccentric contractions are much more likely than isometric or isotonic contractions to damage muscle fibers and connective tissue, as occurs with the common injury of a ruptured Achilles tendon.

## The action of a muscle depends on the axis of its fibers and its origin and insertion on the skeleton

In addition to the contractile and metabolic properties of muscle fibers discussed above, two anatomical features determine the characteristics of the force produced by a muscle.

The first anatomical determinant of muscle function is the arrangement of fibers with respect to the axis of force production (i.e., the angle of pennation). With other determinants of performance (e.g., fiber type and muscle mass) being equal, muscles that have a relatively small number of long fibers oriented parallel to the axis of shortening (e.g., the sartorius muscle of the thigh; Fig. 60-3A, top) shorten more rapidly. Indeed, the more sarcomeres are arranged in series, the more rapidly the two ends of the muscle will approach each other. In contrast, muscles that have many short fibers at an angle to the axis (e.g., the gastrocnemius muscle of the calf; Fig. 60-3A, bottom) develop more force. Indeed, the greater the number of fibers (and sarcomeres) in parallel with each other, the greater the total cross-sectional area for developing force.

The second anatomical determinant of limb movement consists of the locations of the origin and insertion of the muscle to the skeleton. Consider, for example, the action of the brachialis muscle on the elbow joint. The distance between the insertion of the muscle on the ulna and the joint's center of rotation is D , which may be 5 cm . The torque that the muscle produces on the joint is the component of total muscle force that is perpendicular to the ulna, multiplied by D (see Fig. 60-3B). An equivalent definition is that torque is the product of the total muscle force multiplied by the moment arm, which is the length of the line segment that runs perpendicular to the muscle and through the center of rotation (see Fig. 60-3B). As we flex the elbow, the moment arm is constantly changing and muscle force changes as well. For this joint, we achieve maximum torque at 60 degrees of flexion.

Figure 60-3 Determinants of the mechanical action of a muscle.

## Fluid and energetically efficient movements require learning

To perform a desired movement-whether playing the piano or serving a tennis ball-the nervous system must activate a combination of muscles with the appropriate contractile properties, recruit motor units in defined patterns, and

thereby create suitable mechanical interactions among body segments. When we perform movements with uncertaintyas in learning a new skill—actions tend to be stiff because of concurrent recruitment of motor units in antagonistic muscles that produce force in opposite directions. Such superfluous muscle fiber activity also increases the energy requirements for the activity. Even in someone who is skilled, the fatigue of small motor units leads to the recruitment of larger motor units in the attempt to maintain activity, but with loss of fine control and greater energy expenditure. With learning, recruitment patterns become refined and coordinated, and muscle fibers adapt to the task. Thus, movements become fluid and more energetically efficient, as exemplified by the movements of highly trained musicians and athletes, who can make difficult maneuvers appear almost effortless.

## Strength versus endurance training differentially alters the properties of motor units (5) N60-3

The firing pattern of the $\alpha$ motor neuron-over timeultimately determines the contractile and metabolic properties of the muscle fibers in the corresponding motor unit. This principle was demonstrated by cross-innervation experiments in which investigators cut the motor nerve to a muscle composed primarily of fast motor units and switched it with the motor nerve of a muscle composed primarily of slow motor units. (5) N60-4 As the axons regenerate and the muscles recover contractile function over several weeks, the fast muscle becomes progressively slower and more fatigue resistant whereas the slow muscle becomes faster and more susceptible to fatigue. Varying the pattern of efferent nerve impulses via long-term stimulation of implanted electrodes elicits similar changes in muscle properties. A corollary of this principle is that physical activity leads to adaptation only in those motor units that are actually recruited during the activity.

The effects of physical activity on motor-unit physiology depend on the intensity and duration of the exercise. In general, sustained periods of activity of low to moderate intensity performed several times per week-endurance (aerobic) training-result in a greater oxidative capacity of muscle fibers and are manifested by increases in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery, capillary supply, and mitochondrial content (see pp. 12191222). These adaptations reduce the susceptibility of the affected muscle fibers to fatigue (see pp. 1212-1213). The lean and slender build of long-distance (i.e., endurance) runners reflects the abundance of highly oxidative type I and IIa muscle fibers of relatively small diameter, promoting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion between capillaries and mitochondria for high levels of aerobic energy production. Further, the high ratio of surface area to volume of the slender body also facilitates cooling of the body during prolonged activity and in hot environments.

In contrast, brief sets of high-intensity contractions performed several times per week-strength (anaerobic) training-result in type IIx motor units that can produce more force and can shorten against a given load at greater velocity by increasing the amount of contractile protein. The hypertrophied muscles of sprinters and weightlifters exemplify this type of adaptation, which relies more on rapid, anaerobic sources of energy production (see p. 1209).

## CONVERSION OF CHEMICAL ENERGY TO MECHANICAL WORK

At rest, skeletal muscle has a low metabolic rate. In response to contractile activity, the energy consumption of skeletal muscle can easily rise $>100$-fold. The body meets this increased energy demand by mobilizing energy stores both locally from muscle glycogen and triacylglycerols, and systemically from liver glycogen and adipose tissue triacylglycerols. The integrated physiological response to exercise involves the delivery of sufficient $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and fuel to ensure that the rate of ATP synthesis rises in parallel with the rate of ATP breakdown. Indeed, skeletal muscle precisely regulates the ratio of ATP to ADP even with these large increases in ATP turnover.

Physical performance can be defined in terms of power (work/time), speed, or endurance. Skeletal muscle has three energy systems, each designed to support a particular type of performance (Fig. 60-4). For power events, which typically last a few seconds or less (e.g., hitting a ball with a bat), the immediate energy sources include ATP and phosphocreatine (PCr). For spurts of activity that last several seconds to a minute (e.g., sprinting 100 m ), muscles rely primarily on the rapid nonoxidative breakdown of carbohydrate stored as muscle glycogen to form ATP. For activities that last 2 minutes or longer but have low power requirements (e.g., jogging several kilometers), the generation of ATP through the oxidation of fat and glucose derived from the circulation becomes increasingly important. We now consider the key metabolic pathways for producing the energy that enables skeletal muscle to have such a tremendous dynamic range of activity.

## ATP and PCr provide immediate but limited energy

At the onset of exercise, or during the transition to a higher intensity of contractile activity, the immediate energy sources are ATP and PCr. As for any other cell, muscle cells break down ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$, releasing

## N60-3 Endurance ("Aerobic") versus Strength ("Anaerobic") Training

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The distinction between endurance training (e.g., longdistance running) and strength training (e.g., weightlifting) refers to the manner of exercise. Endurance training involves performing a lower-intensity activity for a longer period. Strength training, in contrast, involves performing a highintensity activity for shorter periods.

The distinction between aerobic and anaerobic refers to the metabolic pathway that the muscles primarily use to regenerate ATP. Thus, in aerobic exercise, the cells regenerate ATP primarily by using oxidative phosphorylation. In anaerobic exercise-of course, no one exercises in the absence of oxygen!-the cells regenerate ATP primarily by using anaerobic glycolysis, generating lactic acid in the bargain.

## N60-4 Cross-Innervation Experiments

## Contributed by Steven Segal

The principle described in the text-that it is the type of motor neuron that determines the properties of the muscle fibers the neuron innervates-was demonstrated in experiments reported by Buller, Eccles, and Eccles in a classic paper published in 1960.

$-11.5 \mathrm{kcal} / \mathrm{mole}$ of free energy $(\Delta \mathrm{G})$ under physiological conditions (see p. 1174):

$$
\mathrm{ATP} \rightarrow \mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{P}_{i}+\Delta \mathrm{G}
$$

Muscle cells rapidly regenerate ATP from PCr in a reaction that is catalyzed by creatine kinase:

$$
\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{PCr} \xrightarrow{\text { creatine kinase }} \mathrm{ATP}+\text { Creatine }
$$

Resting skeletal muscle cells contain 5 to $6 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ of ATP but 25 to $30 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{kg}$ of PCr -representing nearly 5 -fold more energy. These two energy stores are sufficient to support intense contractile activity for only a few seconds. When rates of ATP breakdown (see Equation 60-1) are high, ADP levels (normally very low) increase and can actually interfere with muscle contraction. Under such conditions, adenylate kinase (also known as myokinase) transfers the second phosphate group from one ADP to another, thereby regenerating ATP:

$$
\mathrm{ADP}+\mathrm{ADP} \xrightarrow{\text { adenylate kinase }} \mathrm{ATP}+\mathrm{AMP}
$$

The foregoing reaction is limited by the initial pool of ADP, which is small. In contrast, creatine kinase (see Equation 60-2) so effectively buffers ATP that [ATP], changes very little. Although changes in [ATP], cannot provide an effective signal to stimulate metabolic pathways of energy production, the products of ATP hydrolysis- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$, ADP, and AMP-are powerful signals.

The high-energy phosphates ATP + PCr are historically referred to as phosphagens and are recognized as the immediate energy supply because they are readily available, albeit for only several seconds (see Fig. 60-4, red curve). This role is of particular importance at the onset of exercise and during transitions to more intense activity, before other metabolic pathways have time to respond.

## Anaerobic glycolysis provides a rapid but self-limited source of ATP

When high-intensity exercise continues for more than several seconds, the breakdown of ATP and PCr is followed almost instantly by the accelerated breakdown of intramuscular glycogen to glucose and then to lactate. This anaerobic metabolism of glucose has the major advantage of providing energy quickly to meet the increased metabolic demands of an intense workload, even before $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, glucose, or fatty-acid delivery from blood increases. However, because of the low ATP yield of this pathway, muscle rapidly depletes its glycogen stores, which so that intense activity is limited to durations of $\sim 1$ minute (see Fig. 60-4, purple curve).

Muscle fibers store 300 to 400 g of carbohydrate in the form of glycogen (see p. 1171) and, particularly in the case of type II fibers, are rich in the enzymes required for glycogenolysis and glycolysis. In glycogenolysis (see p. 1182), phosphorylase breaks down glycogen to glucose-1phosphate. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system during exercise elevates levels of epinephrine and-by activating $\beta$-adrenergic receptors on muscle fiberspromotes the breakdown of muscle glycogen. Subsequently,
phosphoglucomutase converts glucose-1-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P). Muscle fibers can also take up blood-borne glucose using GLUT4 transporters (see p. 1047) and use hexokinase to phosphorylate it to G6P. During nonoxidative generation of ATP (see Fig. 60-4, purple curve), intracellular glycogen is more important than blood-borne glucose in rapidly contributing G6P for entry into glycolysisbreakdown of glucose to pyruvate (see Fig. 58-6A).

In the absence of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, or when glycolysis generates pyruvate more rapidly than the mitochondria can oxidize it (see below), muscle cells can divert pyruvate to lactic acid, which readily dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and lactate. The overall process generates two ATP molecules per glucose molecule:
$\underset{\text { Glucose }}{\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}}+2 \mathrm{ADP}+2 \mathrm{P}_{i} \rightarrow 2 \underset{\text { Lactate }}{\mathrm{C}_{3} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3}^{-}}+2 \mathrm{ATP}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}+$heat

This anaerobic regeneration of ATP from ADP through breakdown of intramuscular glycogen, although faster than oxidative metabolism, captures only a fraction of the energy stored in glucose. Moreover, the process is self-limiting because the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$generated from the dissociation of lactic acid can lower pH , from 7.1 to nearly 6.2 ; the lower pH inhibits glycolysis and impairs the contractile process, which contributes to muscle fatigue (see p. 1213).

## Oxidation of glucose, lactate, and fatty acids provides a slower but long-term source of ATP

The body stores only a small amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood, and the cardiovascular and respiratory systems require 1 to 2 minutes to increase $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to muscle to support oxidative metabolism. Endurance training accelerates these adjustments. Nevertheless, before the increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery is complete, skeletal muscle must rely on the immediate release of energy from ATP and PCr , as well as anaerobic glycolysis, as just discussed. As blood flow and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery increase over the first 1 to 2 minutes, the contribution of aerobic ATP production reduces the dependence on shortterm sources of ATP. Thus, in order to sustain light and intermediate physical activity for longer than $\sim 1$ minute, muscle regenerates ATP through oxidative metabolism in the mitochondria of type I and type IIa muscle fibers (see Fig. 60-4, blue curve). Muscle also uses oxidative metabolism to recover from intense activities of short duration that relied on the immediate and nonoxidative systems of energy supply.

The nonoxidative metabolism of glucose provides nearly 100 -fold more energy than is available via the immediate breakdown of ATP and PCr. However, oxidative metabolism of the same amount of glucose provides 15 -fold more energy than the nonoxidative metabolism of glucose.

Oxidation of Nonmuscle Glucose The aerobic metabolism of glucose, although slower than anaerobic glycolysis (see Equation 60-4), provides nearly 15 -fold more ATP molecules per glucose molecule (see Table 58-4): (T) N58-15

Figure 60-5 Steady-state energy supply to muscle from energy stores in muscle, liver, and adipose tissue. CoA, coenzyme A.

The majority of glucose that contracting skeletal muscle oxidizes during aerobic energy production comes from circulating glucose, which in turn originates primarily from the breakdown of the hepatic glycogen stores of 75 to 100 g (see p. 1171). Exercising muscle can increase its uptake of circulating glucose by 7 - to 40 -fold; this uptake is balanced by enhanced hepatic glucose release, so that blood [glucose] is stabilized. An increase in portal vein levels of glucagon, in particular (see Fig. 51-12), and a decrease in insulintogether with an increase in epinephrine (see Fig. 58-9B)-
are the main signals for this elevated hepatic glucose output during exercise.

Contracting skeletal muscle is an important sink for blood-borne glucose (Fig. 60-5). Moreover, contractile activity triggers the translocation of additional GLUT4 transporters (see p. 114) from the cytosol to the plasma membrane. This process, which is insulin independent and is likely mediated by activation of AMP kinase, supports increased glucose uptake. Because exercise-induced translocation of GLUT4 does not depend on insulin, endurance exercise is

an important adjunct in controlling elevated levels of blood [glucose] in patients with diabetes.

Oxidation of Lactate During the first minutes of exercise, active muscle fibers use glycogenolysis to liberate glucose and then use glycolysis to form either pyruvate or lactate, depending on the relative activities of glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration. Indeed, lactate production occurs even in fully aerobic contracting muscles with high oxidative capacity. As blood flow and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery increase during the initial minutes of the cardiovascular and respiratory adjustments to exercise, types I and IIa oxidative muscle fibers convert lactate back to pyruvate for uptake and subsequent oxidation by the mitochondria. In addition, glycolytic (type IIx) muscle fibers release lactate that can diffuse to nearby oxidative muscle fibers for aerobic production of ATP (see Fig. 60-5). The lactate that escapes into the bloodstream can enter other skeletal muscles or the heart for oxidation (see Fig. 60-5), or the liver for gluconeogenesis (discussed in next paragraph). This shuttling of lactate provides a metabolic link between anaerobic and oxidative cells. After the initial few minutes of moderate-intensity exerciseand after the cardiovascular and respiratory adjustments have stabilized-exercising muscle takes up and oxidizes blood-borne glucose and simultaneously diminishes its release of lactic acid.

Gluconeogenesis Hepatic gluconeogenesis (see p. 1176) becomes increasingly important as exercise is prolonged beyond an hour and hepatic glycogen stores become depleted. The most important substrates for hepatic gluconeogenesis are lactate and alanine. During prolonged exercise, the key substrate is lactate released into the circulation by contracting skeletal muscle (see below) for uptake by the liver, which resynthesizes glucose for uptake by the muscle-the Cori cycle (see p. 1189).

At workloads exceeding $65 \%$ of maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the lungs ( $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$; discussed on pages 1213-1214), lactate production rises faster than removal and causes an exponential increase in blood [lactate]. Endurance training increases the rate of lactate clearance from the blood at any given [lactate]. Oxidation is responsible for $\sim 75 \%$ of lactate removal, and hepatic gluconeogenesis is responsible for the remainder.

Also during prolonged exercise, the oxidation of branched-chain amino acids by skeletal muscle leads to the release of alanine into the circulation for uptake by the liver, followed by hepatic gluconeogenesis and the release of glucose into the blood for uptake by muscle-the glucosealanine cycle (see p. 1189).

The Cori and glucose-alanine cycles play an important role in redistributing glycogen from resting muscle to exercising muscle during prolonged exercise and during recovery from exercise. For example, after prolonged arm exercise, lactate release from leg muscle is 6 - to 7 -fold greater than in the pre-exercise basal state. (T) N60-5 Similarly, after leg exercise, lactate release from forearm muscle increases. The signal for this lactate release is the elevated circulating epinephrine level (see p. 1210), which stimulates $\beta$-adrenergic receptors in nonexercising muscle as well, leading to glycogen breakdown. Thus, the Cori cycle redistributes glycogen from resting muscle to fuel muscles undergoing prolonged
exercise. During recovery, muscle glycogenolysis and lactate release from nonexercising muscle continue, and lactate enters the liver for conversion to glucose, followed by release into the circulation. The subsequent glucose uptake by previously exercising muscles thereby helps to replenish their glycogen stores. In this way, the body ensures an adequate supply of fuel for the next fight-or-flight response.

Oxidation of Nonmuscle Lipid Most stored energy is in the form of triacylglycerols. In the prototypical $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person, adipocytes store $\sim 132,000 \mathrm{kcal}$ of potential energy (see Table 58-1). The mobilization of lipid from adipocytes (see p. 1182) during exercise is largely under the control of the sympathetic nervous system, complemented by the release of growth hormone during exercise lasting $>30$ to 40 minutes. The result of this mobilization is an increase in circulating levels of fatty acids, which can enter skeletal musclespecially type I and IIa fibers (see Fig. 60-5).

Not only do fatty acids released from adipocytes enter muscle via the circulation, but skeletal muscle itself stores several thousand kilocalories of potential energy as intracellular triacylglycerols, which contribute to fatty-acid oxidation.

In the presence of adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, fatty acids provide up to $60 \%$ of the oxidized fuel supply of muscle during prolonged exercise. The oxidation of fatty acids (see pp. 1183-1185), such as palmitate in the following example, has a very high yield of ATP:

$$
\overbrace{\mathrm{C}_{15} \mathrm{H}_{31} \mathrm{COOH}}^{\text {Palmitic acid }}+23 \mathrm{O}_{2}+106 \mathrm{ADP}+106 \mathrm{P}_{i} \rightarrow
$$

Lipids are an important source of energy when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is available; that is, during prolonged low- to moderate-intensity activity and during recovery following exercise.

Choice of Fuel Sources For sustained activity of moderate intensity, fat is the preferred substrate, given ample $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ availability. For example, at $50 \%$ of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$, fatty-acid oxidation accounts for more than half of muscle energy production, with glucose accounting for the remainder. As the duration of exercise further lengthens, glucose utilization progressively declines and fatty-acid oxidation increases, with fatty acids becoming the dominant oxidative fuel. However, as exercise intensity increases, active muscle relies increasingly on glucose derived from intramuscular glycogen as well as on blood-borne glucose. This crossover from lipid to carbohydrate metabolism has the advantage that, per liter of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed, carbohydrate provides slightly more energy than lipid (see p. 1187). Conversely, as muscle depletes its glycogen stores, it loses its ability to consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at high rates.

At a given metabolic demand, the increased availability and utilization of fatty acids translate to lower rates of glucose oxidation and muscle glycogenolysis, which prolongs the ability to sustain activity. Endurance training promotes these adaptations of skeletal muscle by increasing capillarity (which promotes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery) and mitochondrial content (which promotes oxidative ATP production). Under conditions of carbohydrate deprivation (e.g., starvation), extremely prolonged exercise (e.g., ultramarathon), and impaired

# N60-5 Reallocation of Glycogen from Resting to Exercising Muscle 

## Contributed by Steven Segal

What is the stimulus for a nonexercising muscle (e.g., leg) to release lactate in response to exercise by another muscle (e.g., arm)? During exercise, enhanced sympathetic nerve activity causes the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine (see p. 583). The degree to which epinephrine release rises depends on exercise intensity, duration, and the mass of muscle engaged in activity. The epinephrine, acting on $\beta_{2}$ adrenergic receptors on all (including inactive) muscle fibers, stimulates glycogenolysis. Following the reduction of pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase, lactate enters the blood (see Fig. 60-5). This effect of circulating epinephrine is the primary reason for the release of lactate from inactive muscle, which contributes to the Cori cycle.

The inactive muscle also releases alanine. One explanation is that, with prolonged physical stress (and certainly with starvation), the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. In turn, circulating cortisol would enhance proteolysis in all skeletal muscle (see p. 1022), whether active or inactive. The amino acids liberated would include alanine. Probably more significant for exercise is the transamination of pyruvate to alanine as glutamate (derived from other amino acids through the action of transaminases) is converted to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (see Fig. 58-13). Thus, whether liberated directly from protein breakdown or synthesized from pyruvate, alanine would enter the circulation. As blood glucose falls and blood alanine rises, the pancreatic $\alpha$ cells release more glucagon, which promotes hepatic gluconeogenesis-the alanine-glucose cycle.

glucose utilization (e.g., diabetes), muscle can also oxidize ketone bodies as their plasma levels rise.

## MUSCLE FATIGUE

## Fatigued muscle produces less force and has a reduced velocity of shortening

Muscle fatigue is defined as the inability to maintain a desired power output-resulting from muscle contraction against a load-with a decline in both force and velocity of shortening. A decline in maximal force production with fatigue results from a reduction in the number of active cross-bridges as well as in the force produced per cross-bridge. (5) NS-6 As fatigue develops, the production of force usually declines earlier and to a greater extent than shortening velocity. Other characteristics of fatigued skeletal muscle are lower rates of both force production and relaxation, owing to impaired release and reuptake of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). As a result, fast movements become difficult or impossible, and athletic performance suffers accordingly. Nevertheless, fatigue may serve an important protective role in allowing contractions at reduced rates and lower forces while preventing extreme changes in cell composition that could cause damage. Muscle fatigue is reversible with rest, which contrasts with muscle damage or weakness, in which even muscles that are well rested are compromised in their ability to develop force. For example, muscle damage induced by eccentric contractions (see p. 1207) can easily be mistaken for fatigue, except the recovery period can last for days.

Factors contributing to fatigue include motivation, physical fitness, nutritional status, and the types of motor units (i.e., fibers) recruited as governed by the intensity and duration of activity. Fatigue during prolonged activity of moderate intensity involving relatively low frequencies of motor-unit activation (see p. 1212) is caused by different factors than fatigue during bursts of high intensity involving high frequencies of motor-unit activation (see p. 1212). Moreover, fatigue can result from events occurring in the central nervous system (CNS; central fatigue) as well as from changes within the muscle (peripheral fatigue).

## Changes in the CNS produce central fatigue

Central fatigue reflects changes in the CNS and may involve altered input from muscle sensory nerve fibers, reduced excitatory input to motor control centers of the brain and spinal cord, and altered excitability of $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ motor neurons (see Fig. 15-30). The contributions of these factors vary with the individual and with the nature of the activity. For example, central fatigue is likely to play only a minor role in limiting performance of highly trained athletes who have learned to pace themselves according to the task and are mentally conditioned to discomfort and stress. In contrast, central fatigue is likely of greater importance in novice athletes and during repetitive (i.e., boring) tasks. The identification of specific sites involved in central fatigue is difficult because of the complexity of the CNS. Nevertheless, external sensory input, such as shouting and cheering, can often increase muscle force production and physical performance,
which indicates that pathways proximal to corticospinal outputs can oppose central fatigue.

## Impaired excitability and impaired $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release can produce peripheral fatigue

Under normal conditions, transmission block at the neuromuscular junction does not cause muscle fatigue, even though the release of neurotransmitter can decline. Thus, peripheral fatigue reflects a spectrum of events at the level of the muscle fiber, including impairments in the initiation and propagation of muscle action potentials, the release and handling of intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ for cross-bridge activation, depletion of substrates for energy metabolism, and the accumulation of metabolic byproducts. The nature of fatigue and the time required for recovery vary with the recruitment pattern of motor units and the metabolic properties of their constitutive muscle fibers (see Fig. 60-2).

High-Frequency Fatigue With continuous firing of action potentials during intense exercise, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$entry and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$exit exceed the ability of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (see pp. 115-117) to restore and maintain normal resting ion concentration gradients. As a result, $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{o}$ and $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]_{i}$ increase, so that the resting membrane potential of muscle fibers is more positive by 10 to 20 mV . This depolarization inactivates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, which makes it more difficult to initiate and propagate action potentials. Within the T tubule, such depolarization impairs the ability of L-type $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels to activate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels in the SR (see Fig. 9-3). Fatigue resulting from impaired membrane excitability is particularly apparent at high frequencies of stimulation during recruitment of type II motor units-high-frequency fatigue. On cessation of contractile activity, ionic and ATP homeostasis recovers within 30 minutes; thus, the recovery from highfrequency fatigue occurs relatively quickly.

Low-Frequency Fatigue In prolonged moderate-intensity exercise, the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the SR falls, which apparently reflects changes in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channel or its associated proteins along with inhibition of the SERCA pump (sarcoplasmic and endoplasmic reticulum Ca-ATPase; see p. 118) and thus diminished $\mathrm{SR} \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores; this decrease in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release leads to a depression in the amplitude of the $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ transient that accompanies the muscle twitch. A diminution of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release is apparent at all stimulation frequencies. However, the effect on force development is most apparent at low stimulation frequencies. Indeed, during unfused tetani (see Fig. 9-10C), $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ does not continuously remain at high enough levels to saturate troponin C (see p. 233). As a result, cross-bridge formation is highly sensitive to the amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ released from the SR with each stimulus. In contrast, with high frequencies of stimulation that produce fused tetani (see Fig. 9-10D), $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is at such high levels that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ continuously saturates troponin C and thereby maximizes cross-bridge interactions, which masks the effects of impaired $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release with each stimulus. Fatigue resulting from impaired $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release is thus particularly apparent at low frequencies of stimulation during recruitment of type I motor units-low-frequency fatigue. Recovery requires several hours.

## Fatigue can result from ATP depletion, lactic acid accumulation, and glycogen depletion

ATP Depletion As outlined in Chapter 9, muscle fibers require ATP for contraction (see pp. 234-236), relaxation (see p. 237), and the activity of the membrane pumps that maintain ionic homeostasis. Therefore, the cells must maintain [ATP], to avoid fatigue.

Intense stimulation of muscle fibers (particularly type IIx) requires high rates of ATP utilization, with PCr initially buffering [ATP], (see pp. 1208-1209). As fatigue develops and [PCr], diminishes, [ATP], can fall from 5 mM to $<2 \mathrm{mM}$, particularly at sites of cross-bridge interaction and in the vicinity of membrane pumps, so that respective ATPase activities are impaired. Simultaneously, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{o}} \mathrm{ADP}, \mathrm{Mg}^{2+}$, lactate, and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$accumulate in the sarcoplasm. Impairment of SERCA (see p. 118) at the SR prolongs the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transient while reducing the electrochemical driving force for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the SR. Independently, the fall in [ATP], and increase in $\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]$ can also inhibit $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release via the ryanodine receptor (see p. 230).

Lactic Acid Accumulation Intense activity also activates glycolysis (see pp. 1174-1176)-again, particularly in type IIx fibers)-which results in a high rate of lactic acid production and thus reduces pH , to as low as 6.2 (see Equation 60-4). This fall in pH , inhibits myosin ATPase activity, and thereby reduces the velocity of shortening. The fall in pH , also inhibits cross-bridge interaction, the binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to troponin, the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump, as well as phosphofructokinase (the rate-limiting step of muscle glycolysis; see p. 1176). The combined effects of low pH , and high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ interact to impair the peak force production of muscle fibers more than either agent alone. The mechanisms are reductions in the number of crossbridges and in the force per cross-bridge by impairment of the transition from weak to strong binding states between actin and myosin (see p. 235). In addition, both $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ reduce $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensitivity of contractile proteins, so that higher free $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$ is required for a given level of force production.

Glycogen Depletion During prolonged exercise of moderate intensity ( $\sim 50 \%$ of maximal aerobic power), and with well-maintained $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery, the eventual decrease in glycogen stores in oxidative (type I and IIa) muscle fibers decreases power output. Long-distance runners describe this phenomenon as "hitting the wall." Muscle glycogen stores are critical because the combination of blood-borne delivery of substrates and the availability of intramuscular fatty acids is inadequate to accommodate the energy requirements. (i) N60-6 In long-distance running, endurance depends on the absolute amount of glycogen stored in the leg muscles before exercise. To postpone hitting the wall, the athlete must either begin the event with an elevated level of muscle glycogen or race more slowly. Because glycogen storage is primarily a function of diet, carbohydrate loading can increase resting muscle glycogen stores and postpone the onset of fatigue. Low-carbohydrate diets have the opposite effect. Although physical training has little effect on the capacity for glycolysis, it can promote glycogen storage, particularly if combined with a carbohydrate-rich diet. Aerobic training can spare muscle glycogen by adaptations such as
mitochondrial proliferation (see pp. 1220-1222) that shift the mix of oxidized fuels toward fatty acids. Indeed, well-trained athletes can maintain moderate-intensity exercise for hours.

During exercise at relatively high intensities ( $>65 \%$ of maximal aerobic power), fatigue develops in the order of tens of minutes. One explanation for this decrement in performance is that type IIx muscle fibers fatigue when their glycogen supplies become exhausted, which results in a decline in whole-muscle power output.

## DETERMINANTS OF MAXIMAL $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ UPTAKE AND CONSUMPTION

The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ required for oxidative metabolism by exercising muscle travels from the atmosphere to the muscle mitochondria in three discrete steps:

1. Uptake of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by the lungs, which depends on pulmonary ventilation
2. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to muscle, which depends on blood flow and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content
3. Extraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from blood by muscle, which depends on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient between blood and mitochondria

## Maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the lungs can exceed resting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by more than 20 -fold

The respiratory and cardiovascular systems can readily deliver $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to active skeletal muscle at mild and moderate exercise intensities. As power output increases, the body eventually reaches a point at which the capacity of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport systems can no longer keep pace with demand, so the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the lungs $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ plateaus (Fig. 60-6). At rest, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is typically $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person (see p. 647), which corresponds to 3.6 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed per minute for each kilogram of body mass ( $\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} /[\mathrm{min} \times \mathrm{kg}]$ ). Maximal oxygen uptake measured at the lungs $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}\right)$ is an objective index of the functional capacity of the body's

# N60-6 Mechanism of Fatigue During Prolonged Exercise 

## Contributed by Steven Segal

The onset of fatigue under conditions of prolonged exercise of moderate intensity may be attributable to the leakage of intermediates (e.g., $\alpha$-ketoglutarate) from the citric acid cycle (see Fig. 58-11), which impairs aerobic energy production. Until the concentrations of these intermediates fall below critical levels, glycogen breakdown can restore these intermediates through anaplerotic additions and thereby serve to maintain power output.

ability to generate aerobic power. In people who have a deficiency in any part of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport system (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or advanced heart disease), $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$ can be as low as 10 to $20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} /(\min \times \mathrm{kg})$. The range for mildly active middle-aged adults is 30 to $40 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} /(\min$ $\times \mathrm{kg}$ ); for people in this category, a 3 -month program of aerobic conditioning can increase $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$ by $>20 \%$. In elite endurance athletes, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$ may be as high as 80 to $90 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ( $\min \times \mathrm{kg}$ ), more than a 20 -fold elevation above the resting $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Lowering of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood by hemorrhage or high altitude decreases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$, whereas blood transfusion or aerobic conditioning increases it.

The typical method for determining $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$ is an incremental exercise test on a stationary cycle ergometer or treadmill. Such tests assess training status, predict performance in athletes, and provide an index of functional impairment in patients. During the test, the technician monitors the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the subject's expired air, as well as total ventilation. The criteria for achieving $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$ include (1) an inability to continue the pace at the prescribed power requirement, (2) a leveling off of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ as the power requirement increases (see Fig. 60-6), and (3) a respiratory exchange ratio $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} / \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ $>1.15$. Such a high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} / \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is a transient/non-steady-state occurrence (i.e., not a real respiratory quotient; see p. 681) and indicates that a significant hyperventilation, triggered by low blood pH (see p. 710), is reducing the body's $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ stores.

## $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by muscle is the product of muscle blood flow and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction

The body's total store of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is $\sim 1 \mathrm{~L}$ (mainly in the form of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to hemoglobin), a volume that (if used completely) could support moderate aerobic exercise for 30 seconds at best, heavy aerobic exercise for not more than 15 seconds, and maximal aerobic exercise for less than 10 seconds. If activity is to persist, the body must continually transport $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the ambient air to the muscle mitochondria at a rate that is equivalent to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ utilization by the muscle. This increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport is accomplished by increasing alveolar ventilation to maintain alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ levels that are sufficient to saturate arterial blood fully with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see p. 681) and by increasing cardiac output to ensure a sufficiently high flow of oxygenated blood to the active muscles (see p. 464). The integrated organ-system response to the new, elevated metabolic load involves the close coupling of the pulmonary and the cardiovascular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-delivery systems to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-acceptor mechanisms in the muscle; the response includes sophisticated reflexes to ensure matching of the two processes.

The convective $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-delivery rate is the product of cardiac output (i.e., heart rate $\times$ stroke volume) and arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content:

| Arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ <br> delivery rate <br> to whole body | Heart <br> rate | Cardiac <br> stroke <br> volume | Arterial <br> $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ <br> content |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}} \mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\frac{\mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\min }}$ | $\frac{\mathrm{HR}}{\text { beats }}$ | $\frac{\mathrm{SV}}{\mathrm{mLb} \text { blood }}$ | $\frac{\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\frac{\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{mLb} \text { blood }}}$ |

The rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by skeletal muscle depends on both the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to skeletal muscle and the extraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$
by the muscle. According to the Fick equation (see p. 423), $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the product of blood flow to muscle $(F)$ and the arteriovenous (a-v) difference for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ :
![bo40091984b7](bo40091984b7.jpg)

The $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, established by the rate of oxidative phosphorylation in muscle mitochondria, requires an adequate rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the active muscle. Exercise triggers a complicated series of changes in the cardiovascular system that has the net effect of increasing $F$ and redistributing cardiac output away from the splanchnic and renal vascular beds as well as from inactive muscle to better supply the active musculature (see p. 581). Increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction from the blood by active skeletal muscle occurs at the onset of exercise in response to elevated mitochondrial respiration and the attendant fall in intracellular $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which increases the gradient for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from blood within the microcirculation (see Fig. 24-5) to mitochondria within active muscle fibers.

At the onset of exercise, the content of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the arterial blood ( $\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$; see Fig. 29-3) actually increases slightly (e.g., from 20.0 to $20.4 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{mL}$ blood) secondary to the increase in alveolar ventilation triggered by the CNS (see p. 350). Also as a consequence of the anticipatory hyperventilation, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ actually falls with the onset of exercise. Possible mechanisms of this ventilatory increase include a response to mechanoreceptors in joints and muscles, descending cortical input, and resetting of peripheral chemoreceptors by a reduction in their blood supply (see pp. 711-712). The increase in ventilation in anticipation of future needs is enhanced in welltrained athletes.

## $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery by the cardiovascular system is the limiting step for maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ utilization

For years, exercise and sports scientists have debated over the factors that limit $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$ and thus contribute to performance limitations. As noted above, the transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from atmosphere to muscle mitochondria occurs in three steps: uptake, delivery, and extraction. A limitation in any step could be rate limiting for maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ utilization by muscle.

Limited $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Uptake by the Lungs One view is that the lungs limit $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$. An inability of alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion to saturate arterial blood fully (see Fig. 30-10C) occurs in a subset of elite athletes (including race horses). Thus, a decrease in $\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ occurs at maximal effort on an incremental test. The inability of the lungs to saturate arterial blood in athletes could be the consequence of a ventilation-perfusion mismatch at very high cardiac outputs (see p. 698). (T) N60-7

Limited $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Delivery by the Cardiovascular System According to the prevalent view, a limitation in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport by the cardiovascular system determines $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$. That is, maximal cardiac output, and hence $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery, is the limiting step according to the convective flow model. Support for this

# N60-7 Exercise-Induced Arterial Hypoxemia in Women 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

It has been well established that young male athletes can develop arterial hypoxemia when exercising near their maximal rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}\right)$. Thoroughbred horses can also exhibit exercise-induced arterial hypoxemia (EIAH). The study cited below shows that many healthy and active young women experience a significant EIAH, even when well below $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$. The alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient (see Box 31-1) rises with $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, reaching values 3 - to 10 -fold higher than the resting value when $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is at $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$. The anatomical basis of this effect may be smaller lung volumes (corrected for height and age), reduced diffusing capacity ( $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$; see p. 668), smaller-caliber airways, and reduced hematocrit. Physiologically, the mechanism could involve a significant $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \mathrm{Q}$ mismatch.

Figure 60-7 Dependence of maximal oxygen utilization on oxygen delivery. The graph illustrates the relationship between maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the peripheral tissues $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{Pa}_{\text {max }}}\right)$ and maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by lungs $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}\right)$ for five individuals with different lifestyles. Training increases both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake. (Data from Saltin B, Strange S: Maximal oxygen uptake: old and new arguments for a cardiovascular limitation. Med Sci Sports Exerc 24:30-37, 1992.)
view comes from the observation that training can considerably augment maximal cardiac output and muscle blood flow (see the following section). Moreover, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$ largely increases in parallel with these adaptations (Fig. 60-7).

Limited $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Extraction by Muscle A third point of view is that, with increasing demand, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction by muscle from blood becomes inadequate despite adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery. According to this diffusive flow model, a major limitation in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport is the kinetics of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from hemoglobin in the red blood cell to the muscle mitochondrial matrix. Thus, anything that lowers either the muscle's diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient between hemoglobin and mitochondria reduces $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$.

## Effective circulating volume takes priority over cutaneous blood flow for thermoregulation

When we exercise in the heat, our circulatory systems must simultaneously support a large blood flow to both the skin (see p. 1195) and contracting muscles, which taxes the cardiac output and effective circulating volume (see pp. 554555). During exercise, the ability to maintain both arterial blood pressure and body core temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$ ) within acceptable physiological limits depends on maintaining an adequate effective circulating volume. Effective circulating volume depends on total blood volume, which in turn relies on extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and overall vasomotor (primarily venomotor) tone, which is important for distributing blood between central and peripheral blood vessels.

Effective circulating volume tends to fall during prolonged exercise, especially exercise in the heat, for three reasons (Fig. 60-8).

First, exercise causes a shift in plasma water from the intravascular to the interstitial space. This transcapillary movement of fluid during exercise primarily reflects increased capillary hydrostatic pressure as arterioles dilate (see p. 469). In addition, increased osmolality within muscle cells removes water from the extracellular space. When exercise intensity exceeds $40 \%$ of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$, this loss of plasma water is proportional to the exercise intensity. In extreme conditions, the loss of plasma water can amount to $>500 \mathrm{~mL}$, or $\sim 15 \%$ of the total plasma volume.

Second, exercise causes a loss of total-body water through sweating (discussed in the next subchapter). If exercise is prolonged without concomitant water intake, sweat loss will cost the body an important fraction of its total water. A loss of body water in excess of $3 \%$ of body weight is associated with early signs of heat-related illness, including lightheadedness and disorientation, and it constitutes clinical dehydration. (T) N40-10

Third, exercise causes a redistribution of blood volume to the skin because of the increase in cutaneous blood flow in response to body heating (see Fig. 60-8). Venous volume in the skin increases as a result of the increased pressure in the compliant veins as blood flow to the skin rises. No compensatory venoconstriction occurs in the skin because of the overriding action of the temperature-control system.

In response to this decrease in effective circulating volume that occurs during exercise, the cardiopulmonary low-pressure baroreceptors (see pp. 546-547) initiate compensatory responses to increase total vascular resistance (see Fig. 60-8). The sympathetic nervous system increases this resistance by (1) increasing the splanchnic vascular resistance, which directs cardiac output away from the gut; (2) offsetting some of the thermoregulatory system's vasodilatory drive to the skin; and (3) offsetting some of the vasodilatory drive to the active skeletal muscles.

With heavy heat loads, the restriction of peripheral blood flow has the benefit of helping to maintain arterial blood pressure and effective circulating volume, but it carries two liabilities. First, it reduces convective heat transfer from the core to the skin because of the reduced skin blood flow (see p. 1195), which contributes to excessive heat storage and, in the extreme, heat stroke (see Box 59-1). Second, the limitation of blood flow to active muscle may compromise $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery and hence aerobic performance.

With low thermal and metabolic demand, no serious conflict arises among the systems that regulate effective circulating volume, arterial blood pressure, and body temperature. The cutaneous circulation is capable of handling the heattransfer requirements of the temperature-regulatory mechanism without impairing muscle blood flow or cardiac filling pressure.

## SWEATING

## Eccrine, but not apocrine, sweat glands contribute to temperature regulation

Sweat glands are exocrine glands of the skin, formed by specialized infoldings of the epidermis into the underlying dermis. Sweat glands are of two types, apocrine and eccrine (Fig. 60-9A). The apocrine sweat glands, located in the

![bo42091984b7](bo42091984b7.jpg)

Figure 60-8 Effect of exercise on central blood volume.
axillary and anogenital regions of the body, are relatively few in number $(\sim 100,000)$ and large in diameter ( 2 to 3 mm ). Their ducts empty into hair follicles. These glands, which often become active during puberty, produce a turbid and viscous secretion that is rich in lipids and carbohydrates and carries a characteristic body odor that has spawned an entire industry to conceal. Apocrine sweat glands have no role in temperature regulation in humans, although they may act as a source of pheromones.

Eccrine sweat glands are distributed over the majority of the body surface, are numerous (several million), and are small in diameter ( 50 to $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ). The palms of the hands and soles of the feet tend to have both larger and more densely distributed eccrine glands than elsewhere. The full complement of eccrine sweat glands is present at birth, they become functional within a few months, and their density decreases as the skin enlarges during normal growth. The essential role of eccrine sweating is temperature regulation (see p. 1197), although stimuli such as food, emotion, and pain can evoke secretory activity. Regionally, the trunk, head, and neck show more profuse sweating than the extremities.

Sweat production is quantitatively lower in women than in men, which reflects less output per gland rather than fewer eccrine sweat glands.

## Eccrine sweat glands are tubules comprising a secretory coiled gland and a reabsorptive duct

An eccrine sweat gland is a simple tubular epithelium composed of a coiled gland and a duct (see Fig. 60-9B). A rich microvascular network surrounds the entire sweat gland. The coiled gland, located deep in the dermis, begins at a single blind acinus innervated by postganglionic sympathetic fibers that are cholinergic. (5) N14-4 The release of acetylcholine stimulates muscarinic receptors on the acinar cells, causing them to secrete into the lumen a clear, odorless solution, similar in composition to protein-free plasma. This primary secretion flows through a long, wavy duct that passes outward through the dermis and epidermis. Along the way, duct cells reabsorb salt and water until the fluid reaches the skin surface through an opening, the sweat pore. Although these pores are too small to be seen with the naked

![bo44091984b7](bo44091984b7.jpg)

eye, their location is readily identified as sweat droplets form on the skin surface. Both the secretory cells in the coil and reabsorptive cells in the duct are rich in mitochondria, which are essential for providing sustained energy for the high rates of ion transport that are necessary for prolonged periods of intense sweating-for example, during exercise in hot environments.

Surrounding the secretory cells in the coil is a layer of myoepithelial cells that resemble smooth muscle and may contract, thereby expressing sweat to the skin surface in a pulsatile fashion. However, this action is not essential because the hydrostatic pressures generated within the gland can exceed 500 mm Hg .

Secretion by Coil Cells The release of acetylcholine onto the secretory coil cells activates muscarinic G proteincoupled receptors (see p. 341), which leads to the activation of phospholipase C; phospholipase C activation in turn stimulates protein kinase C and raises $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$. These signals trigger the primary secretion, which follows the general mechanism for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$secretion (see p. 139). An $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{K} / \mathrm{Cl}$ cotransporter (see p. 122) mediates the uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$across the basolateral membrane, and the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exits across the apical membrane via a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (see Fig. 60-9B, lower inset). As $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$diffuses into the lumen, the resulting lumen-negative voltage drives $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ secretion through the paracellular pathway.

The secretion of NaCl , as well as of urea and lactate, into the lumen sets up an osmotic gradient that drives the secretion of water, so the secreted fluid is nearly isotonic with plasma. This secretion of fluid into the lumen increases hydrostatic pressure at the base of the gland and thereby provides the driving force for moving the fluid along the duct to reach the skin surface.

Reabsorption by Duct Cells As the secreted solution flows along the sweat gland duct, the duct cells reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(see Fig. 60-9B, upper inset). $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$enters the duct cells across the apical membrane via epithelial $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (ENaCs; see p. 126), and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$enters through the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR; see p. 120). The $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump is responsible for the extrusion of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$across the basolateral membrane, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$exits via a $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel. Because the water permeability of the epithelium lining the sweat duct is low, water reabsorption is limited, so that the final secretory fluid is always hypotonic to plasma.

Because sweat is hypotonic, sweating leads to the loss of solute-free water (see pp. 806-807), that is, the loss of more water than salt. As a result, the ECF contracts and becomes hyperosmolar, which causes water to exit from cells. Thus, intracellular fluid volume decreases and intracellular osmolality increases (see pp. 132-133). This water movement out of cells helps to correct the fall in ECF volume. The solutefree water lost in perspiration therefore is ultimately derived from all body fluid compartments.

## The NaCl content of sweat increases with the rate of secretion but decreases with acclimatization to heat

Flow Dependence With mild stimulation of acinar cells, the small volume of primary secretion travels slowly along the duct, and the ducts reabsorb nearly all of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and
![bo45091984b7](bo45091984b7.jpg)

Figure 60-10 Flow dependence of sweat composition. CF, cystic fibrosis.
$\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$, which can fall to final concentrations as low as $\sim 10$ to 20 mM (Fig. 60-10). In contrast, with strong cholinergic stimulation, large volume of primary secretion travels rapidly along the duct, so the load exceeds the capacity of the ductal epithelium to reabsorb $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$. Thus, a greater fraction of the secreted $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$remains within the lumen, which results in levels of 60 to 70 mM . In contrast, $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]$in the sweat remains nearly independent of flow at 5 to 10 mM .

Cystic Fibrosis In patients with cystic fibrosis (see Box 43-1), abnormal sweat gland function is attributable to a defect in the CFTR, a cAMP-regulated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channel (see p. 120) that is normally present in the apical membrane of sweat gland duct cells. These individuals secrete normal volumes of sweat into the acinus but have a defect in absorption of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$(and, therefore, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) as the fluid travels along the duct. As a result, the sweat is relatively rich in NaCl (see Fig. 60-10).

Replenishment During a thermoregulatory response in a healthy individual, the rate of sweat production can commonly reach 1 to $2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$, which, after a sufficient time, can represent a substantial fraction of total-body water. Such a loss of water and salt requires adequate repletion to preserve fluid and electrolyte balance. Restoration of body fluid volume following dehydration is often delayed in humans despite the consumption of fluids. The reason for this delay is that dehydrated persons drink free water, which reduces the osmolality of the ECF and thus reduces the osmotic drive for drinking (see pp. 845-846). This consumed free water distributes into the cells as well as the extracellular space, diluting the solutes. In addition, the reduced plasma osmolality leads to decreased secretion of arginine vasopressin

(i.e., antidiuretic hormone), so that free-water excretion by the kidney is increased (see p. 844).

A more effective means of restoring body fluid volume is to ingest NaCl with water. When $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is taken with water (as in many exercise drinks), plasma $\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]$remains elevated throughout a longer duration of the rehydration period and is significantly higher than with the ingestion of water alone. In such conditions, the salt-dependent thirst drive is maintained and the stimulation of urine production is delayed, which leads to more complete restoration of body water content.

Acclimatization With ample, continuing hydration, a heat-acclimatized individual can sweat up to $4 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{hr}$ during maximal sweating. Over several weeks, as the body acclimates to high rates of eccrine sweat production, the ability to reabsorb NaCl increases, which results in a more hypotonic sweat. This adaptation is mediated by aldosterone (see p. 766) in response to the net loss of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the body during the early stages of acclimatization. For example, an individual who is not acclimatized and who sweats profusely can lose $>30 \mathrm{~g}$ of salt per day for the first few days. In contrast, after several weeks of acclimatization, salt loss falls to several grams per day. Thus, an important benefit of physical training and heat acclimatization is the development of more dilute perspiration, which promotes evaporative cooling while conserving NaCl content and thus effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555) during dehydration.

## The hyperthermia of exercise stimulates eccrine sweat glands

As discussed on p. 1193, the rate of perspiration increases with body $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$, which in turn increases during exercise (see p. 1202). The major drive for increased perspiration is the sensing by the hypothalamic centers of increased $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$. Physical training increases the sensitivity of the hypothalamic drive to higher $\mathrm{T}_{\text {core }}$. Indeed, the hyperthermia of exercise causes sweating to begin at a lower skin temperature than does sweating elicited by external heating. The efferent limb of the sweating reflex is mediated by postganglionic sympathetic cholinergic fibers (see p. 543). (5) N14-4

Sweating is especially important for thermoregulation under hot ambient conditions and with exercise-induced increases in body temperature. Indeed, as ambient temperature rises to $>30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, heat loss through radiation, convection, and conduction (see pp. 1196-1197) becomes progressively ineffective, and evaporative cooling becomes by far the most important mechanism of regulating body temperature. Compounding the problem in hot humid environments, evaporative cooling becomes progressively less effective as ambient humidity rises (see Equation 59-5).

## ENDURANCE (AEROBIC) TRAINING

## Aerobic training requires regular periods of stress and recovery

The body improves its capacity to perform work by responding to physical exertion. However, one must meet four conditions to achieve a training effect, or adaptation to exercise.

First, the intensity of the activity must be higher than a critical threshold. For aerobic training (e.g., running, cycling, and swimming), the level of stress increases with the intensity of the activity. (5) N60-3 Second, each period of activity must be of sufficient duration. Third, one must repeat the activity over time on a regular basis (e.g., several times per week). Finally, sufficient rest must occur between each training session, because it is during the recovery period that the adaptations to exercise actually occur.

A great deal of research has focused on optimizing the foregoing four factors, as well as task specificity, for individual athletes competing in specific events. Increasing levels of exertion progressively recruit (see pp. 1204-1205) and thereby adapt type I muscle fibers, followed by type IIa fibers, and then type IIx fibers. In strength training, repetitive powerful bursts of activity favor hypertrophy of type IIx fibers. Regardless of how long or intensely an individual trains, prolonged inactivity reverses these adaptations with an associated decrement in aerobic performance (type I and IIa fibers) or loss or muscle mass (primarily type IIx fibers). Aerobic conditioning increases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {max }}}$ (see pp. 1213-1214) as well as the body's ability to eliminate excess heat that is produced during exercise (see Fig. 59-5).

## Aerobic training increases maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery by increasing plasma volume and maximal cardiac output

$\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {2max }}}$ could increase as the result of either optimizing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to active muscle or optimizing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction by active muscle, as demonstrated in the following modification of Equation 60-7:

| $\begin{aligned} & \text { Maximal } \\ & \text { rate of } \mathrm{O}_{2} \\ & \text { uptake } \end{aligned}$ | Optimal heart rate | Optimal stroke volume | Maximal a-v difference of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| $\begin{gathered} \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { max }} \\ \frac{\mathrm{ml} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\min } \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \mathrm{HR}_{\text {Opt }} \\ \text { Maximal } \\ \text { cardiac output } \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \mathrm{SV}_{\text {opt }} \\ \frac{\mathrm{ml} \text { blood }}{\min } \end{gathered}$ | $\begin{gathered} \left(\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{Cv}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)_{\max } \\ \frac{\mathrm{ml} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{ml} \text { blood }} \end{gathered}$ |

In fact, aerobic training improves both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction; the problem for physiologists has been to determine to what extent each system contributes to the wholebody response. For example, an increase in the circulatory system's capacity to deliver $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ could reflect an increase in either the maximal arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content or the maximal cardiac output, or both.

Maximizing Arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Content Several factors could theoretically contribute to maximizing $\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ :

1. Increasing the maximal alveolar ventilation enhances the driving force for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the lungs (see Fig. 31-4).
2. Increasing the pulmonary diffusing capacity (see p. 668) could enhance $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake at very high cardiac output, particularly at high altitude (see Fig. 30-10).
3. Improving the matching of pulmonary ventilation to perfusion should increase arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and the saturation of hemoglobin (see pp. 689-690).
4. Increasing the concentration of hemoglobin enables a given volume of arterial blood to carry a greater amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see pp. 651-652).

Under nearly all conditions of exercise, the pulmonary system maintains alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at levels that are sufficiently high to ensure nearly complete (i.e., $\sim 97 \%$ ) saturation of hemoglobin with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, even at maximal power output. Thus, it is unlikely that an increase in the maximal alveolar ventilation or pulmonary diffusing capacity could explain the large increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {max }}}$ that occurs with training.
$\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would be increased by elevating the blood's hemoglobin concentration. However, no evidence exists to indicate that physical training induces such an increase. On the contrary, [hemoglobin] tends to be slightly lower in endurance athletes, a phenomenon called sports anemia, which reflects an expansion of the plasma compartment (discussed below). Whereas increasing [hemoglobin] provides a greater $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-carrying capacity in blood, maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport does not necessarily increase accordingly because blood viscosity, and therefore total vascular resistance, also increase. The heart would be required to develop a higher arterial pressure to generate an equivalent cardiac output. The resultant increased cardiac work would thus be counterproductive to the overall adaptive response. Blood doping-transfusion of blood before competition-is thus not only illegal but also hazardous to athletes, particularly when water loss through sweating leads to further hemoconcentration.

Maximizing Cardiac Output Factors that contribute to increasing maximal cardiac output include optimizing the increases in heart rate and cardiac stroke volume so that their product (i.e., cardiac output) is maximal (see Equation 60-9 and pp. 580-583). Because aerobic training does not increase maximal heart rate and has a relatively small effect on $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction, nearly all the increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {max }}}$ that occurs with training must be the result of an increase in maximal cardiac output, the product of optimal heart rate and optimal stroke volume (see Equation 60-9). The athlete achieves this increased cardiac output by increasing maximal cardiac stroke volume. Maximal cardiac output can increase by $\sim 40 \%$ during physical conditioning that also increases maximal aerobic power by $50 \%$. The difference between $40 \%$ and $50 \%$ is accounted for by increased extraction: $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{Cv}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)_{\text {max }}$. Enhanced extraction in endurance training is a consequence of capillary proliferation and increased mitochondrial content of muscle fibers, which creates a greater $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ sink under maximal aerobic conditions.

Maximal cardiac stroke volume increases during aerobic training because expansion of the plasma-and thus blood volume-increases the heart's preload (see p. 526), with a concomitant hypertrophy of the heart. An increase in preload increases ventricular filling and proportionally increases stroke volume (Starling's law of the heart; see pp. 524-526), thereby elevating maximal cardiac output accordingly. An additional benefit is that a trained athlete achieves a given cardiac output at a lower heart rate, both at rest and during moderate exercise. Because it is more efficient to increase stroke volume than heart rate, increasing stroke volume reduces the myocardial metabolic load for any particular level of activity.

The expansion of plasma volume probably reflects an increase in albumin content ( 1 g albumin is dissolved in 18 g of plasma $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). This increase appears to be caused both by translocation from the interstitial compartment and by increased synthesis by the liver. The result of more colloid in the capillaries is a shift of fluid from the interstitium to the blood. Although the total volume of red blood cells also increases with aerobic training, the plasma volume expansion is greater than the red blood cell expansion, so that the hemoglobin concentration falls. This sports anemia occurs in highly trained endurance athletes, particularly those acclimatized to hot environments.

The increased blood volume has another beneficial effect. It enhances the ability to maintain high skin blood flow in potentially compromising conditions (e.g., heavy exercise in the heat), thus providing greater heat transport from core to skin and relatively lower storage of heat (see pp. 1195-1196).

## Aerobic training enhances $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion into muscle

Whereas an increase in maximal cardiac output accounts for a major fraction of the increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to muscle with training, a lesser fraction reflects increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction from blood. Fick's law describes the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ between the alveolar air and pulmonary capillary blood (see Equation 30-4). A similar relationship describes the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the systemic capillary blood to the mitochondria.

The factors that contribute to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusing capacity $\left(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ are analogous to those that affect the diffusing capacity in the lung (see pp. 663-664). Trained muscle can accommodate a greater maximal blood flow because of the growth of new microvessels, particularly capillaries. Indeed, wellconditioned individuals have a $60 \%$ greater number of capillaries per cross-sectional area of muscle than do sedentary people. This increased capillary density increases $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ because it provides a greater surface area for diffusion. Increase in capillary density also reduces the diffusion distance for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ between the capillary and muscle fibers (see Fig. 20-4). In addition, training increases total capillary length and volume, prolonging the transit time of red blood cells along capillaries and thereby promoting the extraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and nutrients from the blood as well as the removal of metabolic byproducts. Finally, the increase in cardiac output enhances muscle blood flow, which helps to preserve a relatively high capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ throughout the muscle and thereby maintain the driving force for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from capillaries to mitochondria.

## Aerobic training increases mitochondrial content

In untrained (but otherwise healthy) individuals, the maximum ability of mitochondria to consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is considerably greater than that of the cardiovascular system to supply $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thus, mitochondrial content does not limit $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{\text {max }}}$. We have already seen that endurance training markedly increases $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery. In parallel, endurance training can also increase the mitochondrial content of skeletal muscle fibers nearly 2-fold by stimulating the synthesis of mitochondrial enzymes and other proteins (Fig. 60-11). The stimulus for mitochondrial biogenesis is the repeated activation of the muscle fiber during training, leading to increases in the time-averaged $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ which may act in two ways (Fig. 60-12). One is by directly modulating the transcription of nuclear genes. The other is by increasing cross-bridge cycling and raising $[\mathrm{AMP}]_{\mathrm{o}}$ thereby stimulating the fuel sensor AMP kinase (AMPK), which, in turn, can modulate transcription.

Figure 60-11 Enzyme adaptation during aerobic training. Endurance training causes a slow increase in the level of several enzymes, as well as in the number of capillaries, maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake, and size of muscle fibers. These changes reverse rapidly on the cessation of training.

Some of the newly synthesized proteins are themselves transcription factors that modulate the transcription of nuclear genes. At least one protein-transcription factor A, mitochondrial (TFAM)-enters the mitochondrion and stimulates the transcription and translation of mitochondrial genes (see p. 22) for key elements of the electron-transport chain (see p. 118). Finally, some newly synthesized proteins encoded by genomic DNA, guided by cytoplasmic chaperones, target to the mitochondrial import machinery and become part of multisubunit complexes-together with proteins of mitochondrial origin.

Because mitochondria create the sink for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption during the oxidative phosphorylation of ADP to ATP, increased mitochondrial content promotes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction from the blood. However, the primary benefit from
mitochondrial adaptation in aerobic conditioning is the capacity to oxidize substrates, particularly fat, an ability that enhances endurance of muscle. Recall that mitochondria are responsible not only for the citric acid cycle (see p. 1185) and oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 1185) but also for $\beta$-oxidation of fatty acids (see p. 1185). As exemplified by marathon and ultramarathon athletes, the greater reliance on fat at a given level of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the metabolic basis of glycogen sparing, and thus reduced production of lactate and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(see p. 1176).

# ENVIRONMENTAL PHYSIOLOGY 

Arthur DuBois

The earth and its atmosphere provide environments that are compatible with an extraordinary number of diverse life forms, each adapted to its particular ecological niche. However, not all the earth's surface is equally friendly for human survival, let alone comfort and function. Mountain climbers and deep-sea divers know the profound effects of barometric pressure ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}$ ) on human physiology, and astronauts quickly learn how the physically equivalent forces of gravity and acceleration affect the body. Humans can adapt to changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}$ and gravity up to a point, but survival under extreme conditions requires special equipment; otherwise, our physiological limitations would restrict our occupancy of this planet to its lowland surfaces.

Much can be learned from exposure to extreme environmental conditions. Although most people do not seek out these extreme environments, the same physiological responses that occur under extreme environmental conditions may also occur, to a lesser extent, in everyday life. In this chapter, we first discuss general principles of environmental physiology and then focus on extreme environments encountered in three activities: deep-sea diving, mountain climbing, and space flight.

## THE ENVIRONMENT

Voluntary feedback control mechanisms can modulate the many layers of our external environment

Claude Bernard introduced the concept of the milieu intérieur (basically the extracellular fluid in which cells of the organism live; see pp. 3-4) and the notion that fixité du milieu intérieur (the constancy of this extracellular fluid) is the condition of "free, independent life." Most of this book focuses mainly on the interaction between cells and their extracellular fluid. In this chapter, we consider how the milieu extérieur, which physically surrounds the whole organism, affects our body functions and how we, in turn, modify our surroundings when it is necessary to improve our comfort or to extend the range of habitable environments.

The milieu extérieur, in fact, has several layers: the skin surface, the air that surrounds the skin, clothing that may surround that air, additional air that may surround the clothing, a structure (e.g., a house) that may surround that air, and finally a natural environment that surrounds that structure. As we interact with our multilayered environment,
sensors monitor multiple aspects of the milieu extérieur and involuntary physiological feedback control mechanismsoperating at a subconscious level-make appropriate adjustments to systems that control a panoply of parameters, including blood pressure (see pp. 533-545), ventilation (see pp. 675-683), effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555), gastric secretions (see pp. 865-872), blood glucose levels (see p. 1038), and temperature (see p. 1193).

The sensory input can also rise to a conscious level and, if perceived as discomfort, can motivate us to take voluntary actions that make the surroundings more comfortable. For example, if we sense that we are uncomfortably hot, we may move out of the sun or, if indoors, turn on the air conditioning. If we then sense that we are too cool, we may move into the sun or turn off the air conditioning. Such conscious actions are part of the effector limb in a complex negativefeedback system that includes sensors, afferent pathways, integration and conscious decision making in the brain, efferent pathways to our muscles, and perhaps inanimate objects such as air conditioners.

For a voluntary feedback system to operate properly, the person must be aware of a signal from the surroundings and must be able to determine the error by which this signal deviates from a desirable set-point condition. Moreover, the person must respond to this error signal by taking actions that reduce the error signal and thereby restore the milieu intérieur to within a normal range. Humans respond to discomfort with a wide variety of activities that may involve any layer of the environment. Thus, we may adjust our clothing, build housing, and eventually even make equipment that allows us to explore the ocean depths, mountain heights, and outer space.

Physiological control mechanisms-involuntary or voluntary-do not always work well. Physicians are acutely aware that factors such as medication, disease, or the extremes of age can interfere with involuntary feedback systems. These same factors can also interfere with voluntary feedback systems. For example, turning on the air conditioning is a difficult or even impossible task for an unconscious person, a bedridden patient, or a perfectly healthy baby. In these situations, a caregiver substitutes for the voluntary physiological control mechanisms. However, to perform this role effectively, the caregiver must understand how the environment would normally affect the care recipient and must anticipate how the involuntary and voluntary physiological control mechanisms would respond.

# N61-1 Role of a Caregiver 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

In the text, we pointed out that a person's involuntary or voluntary physiological control mechanisms sometimes may not function properly. Under these conditions, a caregiver must take control. In a systematic approach, the caregiver would (1) assess the environmental stresses to which the care recipient may be subjected, including their range of intensity; (2) predict the body's ideal involuntary and voluntary reactions to the stresses; (3) consider how the limitations of the care recipient interfere with the natural reactions; (4) determine how to supplement or replace control mechanisms that are not functioning adequately; and (5) express the essential empathy between the caregiver and the patient (i.e., the important words, "I care").

## Environmental temperature provides conscious clues for triggering voluntary feedback mechanisms

Involuntary control mechanisms (see pp. 1198-1201) can only go so far in stabilizing body core temperature in the face of extreme environmental temperatures. Thus, voluntary control mechanisms can become extremely important.

The usual range of body core temperature is $36^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $38^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (see Table 59-1). At an environmental temperature of $26^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $27^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a relative humidity of $50 \%$, a naked person is in a neutral thermal environment (see p. 1196)-feeling comfortable and being within the zone of vasomotor regulation of body temperature. At $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $29^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the person feels warm, and $\sim 25 \%$ of the skin surface becomes wetted with perspiration. At $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $32^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the person becomes slightly uncomfortable. At $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the person becomes hot and uncomfortable, $\sim 50 \%$ of the skin area is wet, and heat stroke (see Box 59-1) may become a hazard. The environmental temperature range of $39^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $43^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is very hot and uncomfortable, and the body may fail to regulate core temperature. At $46^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the heat is unbearable and heat stroke is imminent-the body heats rapidly, and the loss of extracellular fluid to sweat (see pp. 1215-1219) may lead to circulatory collapse and death (see p. 1215).

At the other extreme, we regard environmental temperatures of $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as cool, and $21^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $22^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ as slightly uncomfortable. (1) N61-2 At temperatures of $19^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we feel cold, vasoconstriction occurs in the hands and feet, and muscles may be painful. (2) N61-3

## Room ventilation should maintain $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and levels of toxic substances within acceptable limits

Ventilation of a room $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}\right)$ must be sufficient to supply enough $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and to remove enough $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to keep the partial pressures of these gases within acceptable limits. In addition, it may be necessary to increase $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}$ even more to lower relative humidity and to reduce odors. Dry air in the natural environment at sea level (see Table 26-1) has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 159 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}(20.95 \%)$ and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}(0.03 \%)$.

Acceptable Limits for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted an acceptable lower limit for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of $19.5 \%$ of dry air at sea level (i.e., 148 mm Hg ).

According to OSHA, the acceptable upper limit for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in working environments at sea level is 3.8 mm Hg , or $0.5 \%$ of dry air. This $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would increase total ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$ by $\sim 7 \%$ (see p. 716), a hardly noticeable rise. Exposures to $3 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the ambient air-which initially would cause more substantial respiratory acidosis (see p. 633)-could be tolerated for at least 15 minutes, by the end of which time $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}$ would be nearly double. With longer exposures to $3 \%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the metabolic compensation to respiratory acidosis (see p. 641) would have already begun to increase plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$noticeably. (3) N61-4

Measuring Room Ventilation Two approaches are available for determining $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}$. The first is a steady-state method that requires knowing (1) the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ by the occupants of the room and (2) the fraction of the
room air that is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The equation is analogous to the one we introduced for determining alveolar ventilation, beginning with Equation 31-9:

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\left(\begin{array}{c}
\text { Fraction of } \\
\text { room air } \\
\text { that is } \mathrm{CO}_{2}
\end{array}\right)}
$$

We could use a similar equation based on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ mole fraction and the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ by the occupants. (4) N61-5

In the exponential decay method, the second approach for determining $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}$, the washout of a gas from the room is monitored. The approach is to add a test gas (e.g., $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) to the room and then measure the concentrations of the gas at time zero $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {initial }}\right)$ and-as $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}$ washes out the gas over some time interval ( $\Delta \mathrm{t}$ )—at some later time $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {final }}\right)$. The equation for exponential decay is as follows: (1) N61-6

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}=\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\text {Room }}}{\Delta t} \ln \left(\frac{C_{\text {initial }}}{C_{\text {final }}}\right)
$$

For example, imagine that we wish to measure the ventilation of a room that is $3 \times 3 \times 3 \mathrm{~m}$-a volume of $27 \mathrm{~m}^{3}$ or 27,000 L. Into this room, we place a tank of $100 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and a fan to mix the air. We then open the valve on the tank until an infrared $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ meter reads $3 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {initial }}=3 \%\right.$ ), at which point we shut off the valve on the tank. Ten minutes later ( $\Delta t=10$ minutes), the meter reads $1.5 \%\left(\mathrm{C}_{\text {final }}=1.5 \%\right)$. Substituting these measured values into Equation 61-2 yields (1) N61-6

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {Room }}=\frac{27,000 \mathrm{~L}}{10 \mathrm{~min}} \ln \left(\frac{3.0 \%}{1.5 \%}\right)=1871 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}
$$

This approach requires that the incoming air contain virtually no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and that the room contain no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ sources (e.g., people). Diffusion, thermal convection, and turbulence produce proper mixing of the gases.

Carbon Monoxide More insidious than hypoxia, and less noticeable, is the symptomless encroachment of carbon monoxide (CO) gas on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve (see pp. 649-652). CO-which can come from incomplete combustion of fuel in furnaces, in charcoal burners, or during house fires-suffocates people without their being aware of its presence. Detectors for this gas are thus essential for providing an early warning. CO can be lethal when it occupies approximately half of the binding sites on hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$, which occurs at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ of $\sim 0.13 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ or $0.13 / 760 \cong 170$ parts per million (ppm). (4) N61-7 However, the half-time for washing CO into or out of the body is $\sim 4$ hours. Thus, if the ambient CO level were high enough to achieve a $50 \%$ saturation of Hb at equilibrium, then after a 2-hour exposure (i.e., one half of the half-time) the CO saturation would be $\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} \times 50 \%=12.5 \%$. The symptoms (1) N29-5 at this point would be mild and nonspecific and would include headache, nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and interference with night vision.

Thermal sensations reported by sedentary people wearing a summer shirt and trousers correspond closely to those predicted by computer models that simulate the changes in circulation between the core and surface of the body at either warm or cool environmental temperatures. Skin and clothing temperatures can be measured at a distance using an inexpensive infrared detector available at auto supply stores and used for measuring engine temperatures.

## N61-3 Physical Work and the Conscious Control of Body Core Temperature

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

Performance of physically demanding labor in the heat or cold requires assessment of environmental temperature, wind speed, humidity, the clothing worn, and whether the work is light (standing at a bench), moderate (walking with a 3 -kg load), or heavy (e.g., working with a pick and shovel). From these considerations one may predict the permissible duty cycle-for instance, $75 \%$ work and $25 \%$ recovery, where recovery is a rest period with warming up from a cold environment or cooling off from a hot environment. For a period of up to 3 weeks, acclimatization to heat improves tolerance for working in a hot environment.

# N61-4 Effect of Disease on the Acute Response to Hypercapnia 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

How do subjects respond to increasing levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the surrounding air? An example follows. A normal person who breathed $3 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for 5 or 6 minutes had a total ventilation $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ or minute volume of ventilation) of $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$; then after a rest, the person breathed $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which produced a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ of $27 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, and after another rest breathed $7.5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which produced a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ of $48 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.

We then repeated the experiment with a person with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). For the same three $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels, this COPD patient had $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ values of 12,19 , and $27 \mathrm{~L} /$ min instead of 8,27 , and $48 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. The reason why-at $3 \%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-the COPD patient had a higher $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}(12 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ than the normal person ( $8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ ) was that the COPD patient had a pathologically broad distribution of $\dot{\mathrm{V}} / \dot{\mathrm{O}}$ ratios and thus arterial hypoxemia. But the incremental values in response to $5 \%$ and $7.5 \%$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ were clearly depressed in the COPD patient, compared to the control, owing to a combination of mechanical obstruction
and diminished responsiveness to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (due to metabolic compensation for respiratory acidosis).

Finally, we repeated the experiment with a person having a depressed respiratory center. For the same three $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels, this patient had $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ values of 11,11 , and $12 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. In other words, this patient exhibited virtually no increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{T}$ in response to inhaling $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

In some cases, particularly if the person is anesthetized, it becomes necessary to take over the mechanical work of breathing by using a ventilation pump that is set to provide sufficient ventilation in liters per minute to keep the arterial $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level at $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (equal to an end-tidal alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level of $\sim 5.6 \%$ of dry gas in healthy lungs). A spring-loaded safety valve is used to prevent the pump from delivering too much pressure, which could burst the lungs, and an alarm system alerts an attendant in case the pump fails to deliver the necessary amount of ventilation.

## N61-5 Steady-State Method for Computing Room Ventilation

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

Suppose the occupant of a room has a resting metabolic rate that produces $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ (standard temperature and pressure/dry [STPD]) of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and removes $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ (STPD) of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. STPD means mL at 760 mm Hg (or torr), $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, dry gas. However, if the ambient temperature is $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and the relative humidity is $50 \%$, then the resting metabolic rate would have to increase by $\sim 10 \%$, so that the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would be $\sim 220 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}(0.220 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ and the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would be $\sim 275 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}(0.275 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$.

In addition, suppose that air (ambient temperature $24^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and relative humidity $50 \%$ ) enters and leaves this room at a rate of $100 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$-the room ventilation ( $\mathrm{V}_{\text {Room }}$ ). Fresh air has almost zero $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $20.9 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$. The pulmonary ventilation of the occupant would raise the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ of the air inside and leaving the room
by $(0.220 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}) /(100 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})=0.22 \%$, and would lower the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by $(0.275 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}) /(100 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})=0.275 \%$. Thus, the inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would be reduced from $20.9 \%$ to $(20.9 \%-0.27 \%)=20.63 \%$, and this concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (and also the correspondingly elevated concentration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) would be easily tolerated by the occupant. Suppose, however, that the person were exercising, with 10 times the metabolic rate, or that 10 people were in the room in a resting condition. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level would increase to 10 persons $\times 0.22 \% /$ person $=2.2 \%$, and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would fall to $20.9 \%$ $-(10$ persons $\times 0.275 \% /$ person $)=20.9-2.75=18.15 \%$. Given a minimal standard for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of $19.5 \%$, we would clearly need to increase room ventilation.

# N61-6 Exponential-Decay Method for Determining Room Ventilation 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

## The Principle

The equation that describes the washout of a volume $(\mathrm{V})$ by a flow $(\mathrm{V})$ is:

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\tau}
$$

Here $\tau$ is the time constant. For example, imagine that we have stirred a 1-L beaker filled with water containing some dye. If we flow clear water into this beaker at a rate of $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and simultaneously remove $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ of the newly mixed solution, the dye concentration will decrease exponentially with a time constant of $(\mathrm{V} / \mathrm{V})=(1 \mathrm{~L}) /(1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})=1 \mathrm{~min}$. One minute after the start of the flow (i.e., after 1 time constant), the dye concentration will have fallen to $1 /$ e of its initial value. We could compute the time constant by comparing dye concentrations obtained at any two convenient times. For example, if $C_{\text {initial }}$ is the initial dye concentration and $C_{\text {final }}$ is the dye concentration after some time $\Delta t$, then

$$
\tau=\frac{\Delta t}{\ln \left(\frac{C_{\text {initial }}}{C_{\text {final }}}\right)}
$$

(NE 61-2)

Substituting Equation NE 61-2 into Equation NE 61-1, we have

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\Delta \mathrm{t}} \ln \left(\frac{\mathrm{C}_{\text {initial }}}{\mathrm{C}_{\text {final }}}\right)
$$

The above is analogous to Equation 61-2 in the text.

## The Implications

In Equation 61-3, we saw that the ventilation of the hypothetical room $\left(V_{\text {theor }}\right)$ is $1871 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. This amount of ventilation would be adequate for a person exercising at 10 met (i.e., a metabolic rate that is 10 -fold higher than resting metabolism) because the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production of $2.20 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ (1) N61-5 would be diluted by $1871 \mathrm{~L} /$ min of ventilation to raise the room $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration to $0.12 \%$. Similarly, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake of $2.75 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ (2) N61-5-diluted by $1871 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$-would lower the incoming level from $20.9 \%$ to $(20.9 \%-0.15 \%)=20.75 \%$. Both the computed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ level and the computed $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ level are easily tolerated. Note that the room ventilation of $1871 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ in this example is 18 times as much as the room ventilation in the example in (1) N61-5, where the occupant had to work with a room ventilation of only $100 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.

## N61-7 Calculating the Lethal Partial Pressure of CO

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

To calculate the carboxyhemoglobin ( HbCO ) concentration, remember that when the Hb is exposed to CO the HbCO concentration will equal the $\mathrm{HbO}_{2}$ concentration when the Hb is exposed to oxygen at 210 times the CO concentration. For example, at equilibrium, Hb is $50 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ when the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{fg}}$ is 28 mm Hg . Similarly, the Hb is $50 \%$ saturated with CO at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ of $28 / 210 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which would be 0.13 mm Hg of CO. Because an atmosphere of pressure is $760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 0.13 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ of CO is $0.13 / 760$ of an atmosphere of CO, that is, $0.000,170$ of an atmosphere or 170 ppm of CO.

## N61-8 Effects of CO Poisoning in Patients with Reduced Coronary Blood Flow

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

The heart muscle extracts most of the oxygen from the blood supplied to it in the coronary circulation. With exercise, autoregulation of coronary blood flow normally supplies more oxygen to the myocardium by increasing coronary blood flow. However, in stable angina, the fixed rate of coronary blood flow prevents autoregulation. Thus, when carboxyhemoglobin $(\mathrm{HbCO})$ reduces the ability of arterial blood to release $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ due to the leftward shift of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see pp. 654-655), the heart muscle is deprived of oxygen and anginal pain develops even upon mild exercise.

4-hour exposure (i.e., one half-time), the CO saturation would be $1 / 2 \times 50 \%=25 \%$. The symptoms would be more severe and would include impaired mental function and perhaps unconsciousness.

Threshold Limit Values and Biological Exposure Indices Threshold limit values (TLVs) are reasonable environmental levels of toxic substances or physical agents (e.g., heat or noise) to which industrial workers can be exposed-over a lifetime of working days-without causing predictable harm. Rather than depending on concentrations measured in air or food, we can use biological exposure indices (BEIs) to limit exposure to toxic substances by detecting changes in the body-biomarkers of exposure (e.g., carboxyhemoglobin levels in blood)-that correlate with the intensity and duration of exposure to toxic substances (e.g., CO). 5 N61-9

## Tissues must resist the G force produced by gravity and other mechanisms of acceleration

Standing motionless on the earth's surface at sea level, we experience a gravitational force $(\mathcal{F})$ (5) N61-10-our weightthat is the product of our mass $(m)$ and the acceleration due to gravity $\left(g=9.8 \mathrm{~m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-2}\right)$ :

$$
\underset{\text { newtons }}{\mathcal{F}}=\frac{m}{\mathrm{~kg}} \times \frac{g}{\mathrm{~m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-2}}
$$

Under a particular condition, we may experience a different acceleration (a) from that due to gravity. The $\mathbf{G}$ force is a dimensionless number that describes force $(m \cdot a)$ that we experience under a particular condition relative to the gravitational force $(m \cdot g)$ :

$$
\mathrm{G}=\frac{m \cdot a}{m \cdot g}=\frac{a}{g}
$$

Thus, we normally experience a force of +1 G that would cause us to fall with an acceleration of $9.8 \mathrm{~m} \cdot \mathrm{~s}^{-2}$ if we were not supported in some way.

Accelerations besides that due to gravity also affect physiology. An accelerometer, placed on a belt, would show that we can jump upward with an acceleration of $\sim 3 \mathrm{G}$. It would also show that, on landing, we would strike the ground with a force of $+3 \mathrm{G}$-a force that our bones and other tissues can tolerate if we flex the joints. We discuss G forces from the perspective of air and space flight on pages 1232-1233.

At +1 G , each square centimeter of the cross section of a vertebral body, for example, can withstand the compressive force generated by a mass of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~kg}$ before the trabeculae begin to be crushed. (5) N61-11 Thus, at +1 G a vertebral body with a surface area of $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ could support the compressive force generated by a mass of $\sim 200 \mathrm{~kg}$, far more than enough to support 35 kg , the mass of the upper half of the body of a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person. In fact, this strength would be adequate to withstand a G force of a $(200 \mathrm{~kg}) /(35 \mathrm{~kg})=+5.7 \mathrm{G}-$ provided the backbone is straight. However, if the backbone is not straight, the tolerance could be +3 G , or approximately the acceleration achieved by jumping upward and landing on the feet with the back curved. When a pilot ejects from an aircraft, the thrust of the explosive cartridges accelerates
the seat upward, and this can crush a vertebral body unless the pilot keeps the back straight.

With increasing age, bones tend to demineralize (see p. 1243), which weakens them. Stepping off a curb, an elderly person with demineralized bones may fracture the neck of the femur or crush a vertebra. Demineralization of the vertebrae also reduces stature. Other causes of demineralization are immobilization and space flight. In one study a 6 - to 7 -week period of immobilization from bed rest led to losses of 14 g of calcium from bones, 1.7 kg of muscle, $21 \%$ in the strength of the gastrocnemius muscle, and $6 \%$ in average blood volume. The subjects became faint when suddenly tilted on a board, head above feet. After resuming ambulation, the subjects required 4 weeks for muscle strength to return to normal.

## The partial pressures of gases-other than water-inside the body depend on Pb

As discussed in the next two subchapters, extremely high or extremely low values of Pb create special challenges for the physiology of the body, particularly the physiology of gases. (5) N26-8 Dalton's law (see Box 26-2) states that Pb is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the air mixture. Thus, in the case of ordinary $d r y$ air (see Table 26-1), most of the sea-level Pb of 760 mm Hg is due to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ( $\sim 593 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\sim 159 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$, with smaller contributions from trace gases such as argon ( $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $(\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. As Pb increases during diving beneath the water, or as Pb decreases during ascent to high altitude, the partial pressure of each constituent gas in dry ambient air changes in proportion to the change in Pb . At high values of Pb , this relationship is especially important for ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which can rise to toxic levels. At low values of Pb , this relationship is important for ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which can fall to levels low enough to compromise the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of Hb (see pp. 649-652) and thus the delivery of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues.

The proportionality between Pb and the partial pressure of constituent gases breaks down in the presence of liquid water. When a gas is in equilibrium with liquid water-as it is for inspired air by the time it reaches the trachea (see p. 600)-the partial pressure of water vapor $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PO}}}\right)$ depends not on Pb but on temperature. Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PO}}}$ becomes a negligible fraction of Pb at the very high pressures associated with deep-sea diving, whereas $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PO}}}$ becomes an increasingly dominant factor as we ascend to altitude.

## DIVING PHYSIOLOGY

## Immersion raises $\mathbf{P B}$, thereby compressing gases in the lungs

The average Pb at sea level is 760 mm Hg . In other words, if you stand at sea level, the column of air extending from your feet upward for several tens of kilometers through the atmosphere exerts a pressure of 1 atmosphere (atm). In a deep mine shaft, over which the column of air is even taller, Pb is higher still. However, it is only when diving underwater that humans can experience extreme increases in Pb . A column of fresh water extending from the earth's surface upward 10.3 m exerts an additional pressure of 760 mm Hg -as

## N61-10 The Laws of Motion

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

Newton's first law of motion establishes the concept of inertia: an object at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion remains in motion-at the same velocity-unless acted upon by an external force.

The second law of motion deals with changes in momentum, which is the product of mass and velocity. Because velocity has both magnitude and direction, so does momentum. When an external force (which also has magnitude and direction) acts on a body, the change in the body's momentum is in the direction of the force. Furthermore, momentum changes at a rate that is proportional to the magnitude of the force. Thus, the change in the momentum (i.e., velocity) of a spacecraft depends on the magnitude, direction, and duration of the force (i.e., thrust) exerted by the engine.

The third law of motion states that application of an external force generates an equivalent, but opposing, inertial force ("for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction").

# N61-11 Forces Supported by a Vertebral Body 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

In the text, we analyzed the body mass that a vertebral body could withstand at +1 G . Another way to approach the problem is to determine the maximal pressure that a vertebral body can withstand.

At +1 G , each square centimeter of a vertebral body, for example, can withstand the compressive force generated by a mass of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~kg}$ before the trabeculae begin to be crushed. In other words, a vertebral body can withstand a compressive pressure of

$$
P_{\text {Max }}=\frac{\mathcal{F}_{\text {Max }}}{\text { Area }}=\frac{\text { Mass } \times \text { Acceleration }}{\text { Area }}=\frac{\left(20 \mathrm{~kg}\right) \cdot\left(9.8 \mathrm{~m} \cdot \mathrm{~cm}^{-2}\right)}{\mathrm{cm}^{2}}=\frac{196 \mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~cm}^{2}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~cm}^{2}}
$$

Thus, a vertebral body with a cross-sectional area of $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ could support a maximal force ( $\mathcal{F}_{\text {Max }}$ ) of

$$
\mathcal{F}_{\text {Max }}=P_{\text {Max }} \times \text { Area }=\left(196 \frac{\mathrm{~N}}{\mathrm{~cm}^{2}}\right) \cdot\left(10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)=1960 \mathrm{~N} \quad(\mathbf{N E} 61-5)
$$

This $\mathcal{F}_{\text {Max }}$ is more than enough to support the upper half of the body of a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person (i.e., 35 kg ). Because a vertebral body with a cross-sectional area of $10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$ could support a mass of $20 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{cm}^{2} \times 10 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=200 \mathrm{~kg}$ at $1 \times \mathrm{G}$, it could withstand a headward acceleration of $(200 \mathrm{~kg} / 35 \mathrm{~kg})=+5.7 \mathrm{G}$ —provided the backbone were straight.

Figure 61-1 Pressures at increasing depth of immersion. The pressure at the surface of the ocean is 1 atm and increases by 1 atm for each 10 m of immersion in seawater.
much as a column of air extending from sea level to tens of kilometers skyward. The same is true for a column of water extending from the surface of a lake to a depth of 10.3 m . For seawater, which has a density $\sim 2.5 \%$ greater than that of fresh water, the column must be only 10 m to exert 1 atm of pressure. Because liquid water is virtually incompressible, Pb increases linearly with the height (weight) of the column of water (Fig. 61-1). Ten meters below the surface of the sea, Pb is $2 \mathrm{~atm}, 1 \mathrm{~atm}$ for the atmospheric pressure plus 1 atm for the column of water. As the depth increases to 20 m and then to $30 \mathrm{~m}, \mathrm{Pb}$ increases to 3 atm , then 4 atm , and so on.

Increased external water pressure does not noticeably compress the body's fluid and solid components until a depth of $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~km}$. However, external pressure compresses each of the body's air compartments to an extent that depends on the compliance of the compartment. In compliant cavities such as the intestines, external pressure readily compresses internal gases. In relatively stiff cavities, or those that cannot equilibrate readily with external pressure, increases of external pressure can distort the cavity wall and result in pain or damage. For example, if the eustachian tube is blocked, the middle-ear pressure cannot equilibrate with external pressure, and blood fills the space in the middle ear or the tympanic membrane ruptures.

According to Boyle's law, (4) N26-8 pressure and volume vary inversely with each other. Thus, if the chest wall were perfectly compliant, a breath-holding dive to 10 m below the surface would double the pressure and compress the air in the lungs to half its original volume. Aquatic mammals can dive to extreme depths because rib flexibility allows the lungs to empty. Whales, for example, can extend a breath-hold dive for up to 2 hours, descending to depths as great as 900 m ( 91 atm ) without suffering any ill effects. The human chest wall does not allow complete emptying of the lungs-except in a few trained individuals, and indeed the human record for a breath-hold dive is in excess of 200 m below the surface. (5) N61-12

In a breath-hold dive that is deep enough to double Pb , alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ will also double to 80 mm Hg (see p. 1225). Because this value is substantially higher than the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood at sea level ( 46 mm Hg ), the direction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion across the blood-gas barrier reverses, alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters pulmonary-capillary blood, and thus arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases. In time, metabolically generated $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ accumulates in the blood and eventually raises mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to values higher than alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, so $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion again reverses direction and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses into the alveoli. The increase in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ can reduce the duration of the dive by increasing ventilatory drive (see p. 716). During a rapid ascent phase of a breath-hold dive, the fall in Pb leads to a fall in alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which promotes the exit of both gases from the blood and thus a rapid fall in both arterial (a) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}$ reduces the drive to breathe. The fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}$-and thus cerebral $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-can lead to deep-water blackout. (5) N61-13

## SCUBA divers breathe compressed air to maintain normal lung expansion

Technical advances have made it possible for divers to remain beneath the water surface for periods longer than permitted by a single breath-hold. One of the earliest devices was a diving bell that surrounded the diver on all sides except the bottom. Such a bell was reportedly used by Alexander the Great in 330 BC and then improved by Sir Edmund Halley in 1716 (Fig. 61-2). (5) N61-14 By the early 19th century, pumping compressed air from above the water surface through a hose to the space underneath the bell kept water out of the bell. In all of these cases, the diver breathed air at the same pressure as the surrounding water. Although the pressures both surrounding the diver's chest and inside the airways were far higher than at sea level, the pressure gradient across the chest wall was normal. Thus, the lungs were normally expanded.

The conditions are essentially the same in a modern-day caisson, a massive, hollow, pressurized structure that functions like a large diving bell. Once again, the pressure inside the caisson ( 3 to 4 atm ) has to be high enough to prevent water at the bottom of the caisson from entering. Several workers ("sand hogs") at the bottom of the caisson may excavate material from the bottom of a river for constructing tunnels or foundations of bridges.

Technical advances also extended to individual divers, who first wore diving suits with spherical helmets over their heads (Fig. 61-3A). The air inside these helmets was pressurized to match exactly the pressure of the water in which they were diving. In 1943, Jacques Cousteau perfected the self-contained underwater breathing apparatus, or SCUBA, that replaced cumbersome gear and increased the mobility and convenience of an underwater dive (see Fig. 61-3B). (5) N61-15

Deep dives for extended periods of time require training and carry the risk of drowning secondary to muscle fatigue and hypothermia. Air flotation and thermal insulation of the diving suit lessen these hazards. For reasons that will become apparent, use of any of these techniques while breathing room air carries additional hazards, including nitrogen narcosis, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity, and problems with decompression.

## N61-12 Decrease in Lung Volume with Depth of Immersion

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

Imagine that a person at sea level makes a maximal inspiration, achieving a total lung capacity (TLC; see p. 602) of 6 L . What happens if this individual then dives into seawater to a depth of 10 m ? The Pb as well as the pressure of the air in the lungs doubles to 2 atm at this depth. If the chest wall is perfectly compliant, this increase in Pb would reduce the original lung volume to ( $6 \mathrm{~L}) / 2$, or 3 L . This new lung volume is only about twice the lung's normal residual volume (RV), which is normally 1.5 to 1.9 L (see p. 602).

If the person descends an additional 10 m to a total depth of 20 m , Pb will now increase to 3 atm . Under these conditions, lung volume will fall to one third of its original value, or to 2 L .

A total descent to $30 \mathrm{~m}(\mathrm{~Pb}=4 \mathrm{~atm})$ will reduce lung volume to one quarter of its initial value, or to about the normal RV.

Competitive freediving is organized by two international bodies: the International Association for the Development of Apnea (AIDA) and the World Underwater Federation (CMAS). These organizations recognize different disciplines, based on the permissible methods of descent and ascent. In the No-Limits Apnea category, Herbert Nitsch reached a depth of 214 m in 2007.

If the person is using a SCUBA system (see p. 1226) to breathe compressed air, then the lungs will re-expand to normal volume. If the individual at depth were to make a maximal inspiration to TLC, remove the SCUBA mouthpiece, and then rapidly ascend toward the surface, the air in the lungs would expand to a greater-than-physiological volume. Therefore, the individual would have to exhale during the ascent to prevent the lungs from overexpanding.

## N61-13 Shallow-Water Blackout

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

Imagine that a person excessively hyperventilates before taking a deep breath and attempting to swim a long distance underwater. During the underwater exercise, arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{la}}$ will fall, and the person may become hypoxic before the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ rises sufficiently to increase the drive to ventilate and cause the swimmer to surface. The result can be shallowwater blackout and-if help is not close at hand-drowning.

Although it may be intuitive to overbreathe in preparation for a long underwater swim, beware of too much of a good thing: two deep breaths are acceptable, but prolonged hyperventilation can be fatal.

# N61-14 The Diving Bell 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois, translated by Ulrich Hopfer

The following is a translation of a passage from a book (written in German) titled Diseases of Air Pressure with Special Considerations of So-called Caisson Disease by Dr. Richard Heller, Dr. Wilhelm Mager, and Hermann von Schroetter, PhD, MD.
"There are several reports that Aristotle had the idea to provide air to divers underwater by using an air tube. One also hears from Figuier that a diver apparatus was used in Venice in the beginning of the 17th century. This apparatus was called 'Cornemuse' or 'Capuchon' and used a bellow to provide air." Nevertheless, the first certain information we have is that Denys Papin had the idea to renew air in diver bells by way of bellows and valves to prolong the time to remain underwater.
"Therefore, a new period of diving begins with Papin and Halley, who actually put the idea into practice in 1716. The new period brings about the most important progress in this area.
"The invention of the Cornemuse, as well as the inventions of Papin and Halley, constitute the beginning of the diving apparatus in use today.
"Papin dealt already in 1672, in a theoretical publication with Huygens, with the influence of changes in air pressure and gave an explanation why animals die under a vacuum chamber venting valve.
"Edm. Halley, the famous Astronomer and Secretary of the English Society of Sciences, wrote up his experiences in 1716 in the 'Transactions anglic' under the title of 'The art of living under water.'
"For low depths, the air delivery into the diving bell was achieved by two leather tubes, whereby one was used to pump in air with a bellows and the other allowed the air to escape. This arrangement with bellows did not work for greater depths of over 3 fathoms [i.e., 18 feet or $\sim 5.5 \mathrm{~m}$ ]. For these depths, barrels with air would be lowered into the water, while the used air was released into the water through a valve. Halley lowered himself together with 4 other persons to a depth of 9-10 fathoms, about 17 m , in 1721, whereby 7-8 barrels of air had to be used.
"His diving bell was made of wood, 8 feet high, in the form of a cut-off cone, with 3 feet diameter at the apex and 5 feet at the base [see Fig. 61-2]. The diving bell had a cap of lead. Additional lead weights were fastened at the lower edge so that the bell could sink to the bottom of the sea.... Glass in the ceiling served as window. There was a valve in the dome, through which the used-up, warm air could escape. A type of platform was attached to the free edge of the bell with ropes and fixed in place through weights. Divers would use this platform.
"The entire apparatus was fastened to the main spreader of a ship used to move the bell to its destination. To renew air when the bell was underwater, Halley used two small barrels of 160 L each and lowered the barrels with the aid of weights. The barrels were connected to the bell via a leather tube that was puttied with wax and oil into the cover of the barrel. A hole in the bottom of the barrel allowed water to enter it thus generating pressure to move the air into the bell.
"The barrels were moved to the surface, refilled with air and re-lowered on a signal. The diver serviced the tubes, brought them into the bell, and regulated the airflow through valves at the end of the tubes.
"Nevertheless, the divers suffered, as described by Halley, from the significant increase in temperature within the bell due to compression of the air so that any stay in the bell was difficult. Moreover, he describes that the workers had pain in their ears, and nosebleeds once they were back at the surface.
"During this time, there was also remarkable progress in efforts to get air travel going. On August 8, 1709, the Portuguese Pater Bartholomeo Laurenco de Gussmann lifted himself up in the air with an airship constructed by him in the Indian House in Lisbon and in front of King John V and the entire court. Unfortunately, he got stuck at the roof of the palace and crashed. His device consisted of stiffened paper and the uplifting was caused by heated air. ... As often seen in the history, this great invention was snagged by an unfortunate, small obstruction so that the inventor got forgotten."

## N61-15 Diving Helmets and the SCUBA System

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

In the diving helmet shown in Figure 61-3A, a nonreturn valve was placed at the point where the air hose met the helmet. This device prevented air from escaping from the helmet in case the hose were to rupture.

The SCUBA system devised by Jacques Cousteau (see Fig. 61-3B) consists of five major elements:

1. A tank of gas compressed to a pressure that exceeds the highest pressures that the diver will encounter during the dive.
2. A reducing valve that delivers gas from the tank to the diver's hose at a pressure of 6 to 7 atm .
3. A "demand" breathing valve for inspiration, triggered to open by the slight decrease in pressure caused by the diver's inspiration. This valve delivers the air mixture to the diver at the ambient pressure.
4. An exhaust valve that allows expired air to be released at a pressure that is slightly higher than the ambient pressure.
5. A face mask or mouthpiece with a gas-delivery system that has a small ventilatory dead space (see p. 675).

[^0]:    *This apparatus was supposed to contain a pipe with an enlargement at the lower end that could go over the head of the diver. This pipe provided air driven by bellows, while another pipe returned exhaled air to the surface.

Figure 61-2 Diving bell. Between 1716 and 1721, Halley, the astronomer who gave his name to the comet, designed and built a wooden diving bell with an open bottom. Because the bell was at a relatively shallow depth ( $\sim 12 \mathrm{~m}$ ), the water rose only partly into the bell. In Halley's system, the air was replenished from a barrel that was open at the bottom and weighted with lead to sink beneath the diving bell. Thus, the air pressure in the barrel was higher than that in the bell. The diver used a valve to regulate airflow into the bell. This design was in use for a century, until a practical pump was available for pumping air directly from the surface. The lower part of the figure illustrates what would have happened if Halley's bell had been lowered to much larger depths. The greater the depth, the greater the water pressure. Because the air pressure inside the bell must be the same as the water pressure, the air volume progressively decreases at greater depths, and the water level rises inside the bell. (1) N61-14

## Increased alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ can cause narcosis

Descending beneath the water causes the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ nearly 600 mm Hg at sea level (see Table 26-1)-to increase as Pb increases. According to Henry's law (see Box 26-2), the increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ will cause more $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ to dissolve in pulmonary-capillary blood and, eventually, the body's tissues. The dissolved $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ in various compartments begins to increase immediately but may take many hours to reach the values predicted by Henry's law. Because of its high lipid solubility, $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ dissolves readily in adipocytes and in membrane lipids. A high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ reduces the ion conductance of membranes, and therefore neuronal excitability, by mechanisms that are similar to those of gas anesthetics. Diving to increased depths (e.g., 4 to 5 atm ) while breathing compressed air causes nitrogen narcosis. Mild nitrogen narcosis resembles alcohol intoxication (e.g., loss of psychosocial inhibitions). According to "Martini's law," each 15 m of depth has the effects of drinking an additional martini. Progressive narcosis occurs with increasing depth or time of the dive and is accompanied by lethargy and drowsiness, rapid onset of fatigue, and, eventually, a loss of consciousness. Because it develops insidiously, nitrogen narcosis poses a potentially fatal threat to divers who are not aware of the risks.

## Increased alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ can lead to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity

At sea level, dry inspired air has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 159 mm Hg . However, the alveolar (A) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of a healthy person at sea-level air is $\sim 101 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, reduced from 159 mm Hg by humidification in the airways and removal of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by gas exchange with the blood (see p. 681). $\mathrm{Pa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at sea level is very close to $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (within $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and nearly saturates Hb , to yield an arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood (Fig. 61-4, red curve). As Pb -and therefore arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-increases at greater depths, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to Hb increases very little. However, according to Henry's law (see p. 593), the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that is physically dissolved in the water of blood increases linearly (see Fig. 61-4, black line). Thus, the increment of total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content at depth reflects dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see Fig. 61-4, blue curve).

During a breath-hold dive to 5 atm , or in a hyperbaric chamber pressurized to 5 atm , arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases to $\sim 700 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, slightly higher than when breathing $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ at sea level. Exposure to such a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ has no ill effects for

up to several hours. However, prolonged exposure damages the airway epithelium and smooth muscle, causing bronchiolar and alveolar membrane inflammation and, ultimately, pulmonary edema, atelectasis, fibrin formation, and lung consolidation. These effects are the result of inactivation of several structural repair enzymes and oxidation of certain cellular constituents.

A prolonged elevation of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ also has detrimental effects on nonpulmonary tissues, including the central nervous system (CNS). Exposure to an ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 1500 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (e.g., breathing room air at $\sim 10 \mathrm{~atm}$ ) for as little as 30 to 45 minutes can cause seizures and coma. Preliminary symptoms of $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ toxicity include muscle twitching, nausea, disorientation, and irritability. The toxic effects of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ occur because free radicals (e.g., superoxide anion and peroxide free radicals; see pp. 1238-1239) oxidize the polyunsaturated fattyacid component of cell membranes as well as enzymes that are involved in energy metabolism. At the more modest $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ levels that normally prevail at sea level, scavenger enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (see p. 1238) eliminate the relatively few radicals formed.

## Using helium to replace inspired $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ avoids nitrogen narcosis and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity

Several occupations-including deep mining, caisson work, and deep diving (5) N61-17-require people to spend extended periods at a Pb greater than that at sea level.

During an extended dive or other exposure to high pressure (one exceeding several hours), the body's tissues gradually equilibrate with the high-pressure gases that one has been breathing. This equilibrated state is referred to by the misnomer saturation. At sea level, the human body normally contains $\sim 1 \mathrm{~L}$ of dissolved $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, equally distributed

## N61-16 Effect of SCUBA Diving on Alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

If a diver were instantaneously submerged to a depth of 10 m in seawater (i.e., with a doubling of Pb ), in the absence of ventilation, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would double (see p. 1225). If the diver is not ventilating, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would exceed pulmonarycapillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. As a result, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would diffuse slowly into the blood and raise arterial $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$. The result would be a gradually developing respiratory acidosis (see p. 633). However, in real life, SCUBA divers breathe as they descend to depth gradually. This ventilation prevents alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from rising beyond the value at sea level. In the new steady state-assuming that both the body's $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production rate $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ and the alveolar ventilation $\left(\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ remain constant-the alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at depth will be the same as that at sea level (see Equation 31-9).

## N61-17 High-Pressure Occupations

## Deep Mining

In deep mining, workers descend down a shaft to depths as great as 2.4 km below the surface. Just as Pb falls with ascent to a high altitude, it rises with descent to a great depth in a mine, doubling approximately every 5.5 km of depth. Nevertheless, 2.4 km below the earth's surface, Pb is only -1.4 atm, which presents little problem to the miner. The greatest health hazards for the deep miner are from exposure to high temperature (ambient temperature increases by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ every $\sim 300 \mathrm{~m}$ ), from humidity (miners use a fine water spray to minimize dust), and from inspiration of particulates.

## Caisson Work

Caisson workers rarely experience $>3$ or 4 atm , and only for relatively brief periods. Because nitrogen narcosis begins to appear only at -5 atm of room air after more than an hour, and because oxygen toxicity only begins to appear at -10 atm of room air after $>30 \mathrm{~min}$, caisson workers can avoid the adverse effects of increased Pb while they are in the caisson. However, caisson workers may have major difficulties caused by decompression when exiting the caisson.

## Deep-Diving Work

Divers may spend hours, days, or even weeks at depths between 60 m and 300 m below the water surface. They wear diving suits when working and live in compression chambers when at "leisure." Deep divers who spend days or weeks at high Pb must breathe special gas mixtures to avoid nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity.

between the body's water and fat compartments. As $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ rises, the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ equilibrates only slowly with the body's lipid stores because adipose tissue is relatively underperfused. Although a deep dive of several minutes does not provide sufficient time to equilibrate the fat with $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, one of several hours' duration does. At equilibrium-as required by Henry's law-the volume of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ dissolved in the tissues is proportional to alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$. Thus, if the body normally dissolves 1 L of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ at a Pb of 1 atm , it will ultimately dissolve 4 L of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ at a Pb of 4 atm . These same principles apply to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, although with different solubilities and speeds of equilibration in various tissues.

The adverse effects of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ depend on the amount of gas that is dissolved in tissues. The amount, in turn, increases with the dive's depth (i.e., partial pressure of the gas) and duration (i.e., how close the gas is to achieving equilibrium with various tissues). Thus, the length of time that a diver can spend safely underwater is inversely proportional to the depth of the dive.

To prevent nitrogen narcosis in saturation diving conditions, divers must partly or completely replace $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ with another inert gas. Helium is the replacement gas of choice for four reasons: (1) N61-18

1. Helium has only a fraction of the narcotizing effect of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$.
2. Helium dissolves in the tissues to a lesser extent than $\mathrm{N}_{2}$.
3. Helium has a lower density than $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and this lowers effective airway resistance. However, the low density of helium facilitates convective "air" cooling around the body, so that heat loss is increased. Thus, ambient temperature must be higher in a high-helium compression chamber.
4. During the decompression phase of a dive, helium diffuses out of the tissues more rapidly than does $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, which alleviates most of the problems associated with decompression.

To prevent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ toxicity in saturation diving conditions, divers must reduce the fraction of inspired air that is $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ $\left(\mathrm{FI}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ in the compressed-gas mixture. Thus, at a Pb of 10 atm , an $\mathrm{FI}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $2 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in helium will provide the same inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ as room air does at sea level (i.e., $\mathrm{FI}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 20 \%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at a Pb of 1 atm ). Of course, the diver must monitor the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which is the physiologically relevant parameter.

## After an extended dive, one must decompress slowly to avoid decompression illness

Although the preceding three sections have focused on problems divers face while at great depths, serious difficulties also arise if-after a deep saturation dive-the diver returns to the surface too quickly. At the end of a saturation dive, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ is at the same high value in the alveoli and most tissues. As Pb falls during ascent, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ will fall as well, which creates a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ gradient from the mixed-venous blood to the alveolar air. Washout of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ from the blood creates a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ gradient from tissues to blood. To allow enough time for the dissolved $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ to move from tissues to blood to alveoli, (1) N61-19 a diver must rise to the surface slowly (no faster than $\sim 3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{hr}$ ). Because $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ exits from water much faster than it does from fat, the total elimination of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ has two
components: some compartments empty quickly (e.g., blood), and some empty slowly (e.g., joints, fat, eyeballs).

Too rapid an ascent causes the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the tissuespreviously dissolved under high pressure-to leave solution and form bubbles as Pb falls. This process is identical to the formation of gas bubbles when one opens a bottle of a carbonated beverage that had been capped under high pressure. Similar problems can occur in pilots who bail out from a pressurized aircraft at high altitude and in divers who ascend to altitude or become aircraft passengers (i.e., are exposed to a lower-than-normal Pb ) too soon after completing a dive that, by itself, would not cause difficulties.

During a too-rapid decompression, bubble formation can occur in any tissue in which $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ has previously been dissolved. Decompression illness (DCI) (1) N61-20 is the general term for two major types of clinical disorder:

1. Decompression sickness (DCS) is caused by local bubble formation, either in tissues or in venous blood. In tissues, the distortion produced by these bubbles can affect function and cause itching or pain. In veins, the bubbles can cause obstruction, leading to capillary leaks. Mild or type I DCS can include short-lived mild pains ("niggles"), pruritus, a skin rash, and deep throbbing pain (bends), resulting from bubbles that form in muscles and joints. Serious or type II DCS can include symptoms in the CNS, lungs, and circulatory system. The CNS disorder-most commonly involving the spinal cord-reflects bubble formation in the myelin sheath of axons, which compromises nerve conduction. Symptoms may range from dizziness-the staggers-to paralysis. Pulmonary symptoms-the chokes-result from bubbles that originate in the systemic veins and travel as gas emboli to lodge in the pulmonary circulation, and include burning pain on inspiration, cough, and respiratory distress. In the circulatory system, bubbles not only can obstruct blood flow but also can trigger the coagulation cascade (see pp. 440444), leading to the release of vasoactive substances. Hypovolemic shock is also a part of this syndrome.
2. Arterial gas embolization (AGE) is caused by bubbles that enter the systemic arterial blood via either tears in the alveoli or right-to-left shunts (e.g., a patent foramen ovale) and then become wedged in the brain or other organs. Large arterial gas emboli can have catastrophic consequences unless the victim receives immediate recompression treatment.

Figure 61-5 shows how long a diver can spend at various depths-breathing room air-without having to undergo a decompression protocol during the ascent. For example, a dive to 8 m can last indefinitely without any ill effects during the ascent. A dive of 25 minutes' duration will not provide sufficient time to saturate the tissues unless the dive exceeds 40 m . However, a longer dive at 40 m will require a decompression program. For instance, a 20 -minute dive to a depth of 90 m requires nearly 3 hours of decompression time. Thus, the rate at which a diver should ascend to avoid DCI depends on both the depth and the duration of the dive. Divers use detailed tables to plan their rate of ascent from a deep dive.

The best treatment for DCI is to recompress the diver in a hyperbaric chamber. Recompression places the gases back under high pressure, forcing them to redissolve in the tissues,

## N61-18 Properties of Helium

## Contributed by Ethan Nadel

Helium is an odorless, tasteless, and colorless gas. Compared to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, it has a lower solubility in water, which means that it dissolves in tissues to a lesser extent. In fact, helium has the lowest water solubility of all gases.

The density of helium is nearly an order of magnitude lower than that of nitrogen $\left(0.178 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}\right.$ versus $1.25 \times$ $10^{-3} \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{cm}^{3}$ ), so that the Reynolds number ( $R e$; see Equation 27-11) is reduced by a similar factor. Thus, at the same air velocity, helium is far less likely to exceed $R e$ and thereby engage in turbulent flow. Because turbulent flow increases the effective airway resistance (see p. 617), helium will have a lower effective airway resistance than nitrogen.

The viscosity of helium ( $194 \mu \mathrm{P}$ at $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) is not markedly different from that of nitrogen ( $178 \mu^{\mathrm{P}}$ at $27.4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Thus, according to Poiseuille's law (see Equation 27-8), the resistance under laminar flow conditions would be very similar for helium and nitrogen-assuming that the length and radius of the airway is unchanged.

## N61-19 Nitrogen Washout: The Oxygen Window

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

The extra nitrogen can be eliminated without forming bubbles in the venous blood because of something called the oxygen window. This window occurs because the sum of gas pressures in the venous blood leaving the tissues is less than the sum of gas pressures in the arterial blood entering the tissues. The reason for this is that-for a resting person at sea levelthe partial pressure of oxygen falls from an arterial level of 100 mm Hg to a venous tension of 40 mm Hg , whereas the carbon dioxide tension rises only from 40 to 46 mm Hg ; this difference leaves a "window" of $100-40-6=54 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the so-called oxygen window, into which nitrogen can move from the tissues into the blood-in an amount that corresponds to a partial pressure of 54 mm Hg in the bloodwithout raising the sum of pressures of the gases above the water pressure surrounding the body. The nitrogen dissolved at 54 mm Hg is carried from the tissues to the alveolar air without forming bubbles in the bloodstream as the person ascends at a rate of $3 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{hr}$ following a saturation dive because in 1 hour, the dissolved nitrogen carried to the lungs in the oxygen window is expired and leaves the body.

## HIGH-ALTITUDE PHYSIOLOGY

## PB and ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ on top of Mount Everest are approximately one third of their values at sea level

Unlike a column of water, which is relatively noncompressible and has a uniform density, the column of air in the atmosphere is compressible and has a density that decreases exponentially ascending from sea level. Half of the mass of the earth's atmosphere is contained in the lowest 5500 m . Another quarter is contained in the next 5500 m (i.e., 5500 to $11,000 \mathrm{~m}$ of altitude). In other words, at higher and higher altitudes, the number of gas molecules pressing down on a mountain climber also falls exponentially; PB falls by half for each $\sim 5500 \mathrm{~m}$ of ascent (Fig. 61-6).

Everest Base Camp At an altitude of 5500 m-which also happens to be the altitude of the first base camp used in most
ascents of Mount Everest-PB is half the value at sea level ( $\mathrm{PB} \cong 380 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), as is the ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$. At this altitude, arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery (arterial blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content $\times$ cardiac output) can still meet $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ demands in most healthy, active persons, even during mild physical activity. However, the body's compensatory responses to reduced ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at high altitude vary among individuals. Thus, exposure to an altitude of 5500 m is problematic for a significant portion of the population.

Peak of Mount Everest The peak of Mount Everest8848 m above sea level-is the highest point on earth. Pb at the peak is $\sim 255 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, approximately one third that at sea level, and the ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is only $\sim 53 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. For a climber at the peak of Mount Everest, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the humidified inspired air entering the alveoli is even lower, because of the effects of water vapor $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=47 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right.$ at $\left.37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Therefore, inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=21 \% \times(255-47)=44 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, compared with 149 mm Hg at sea level (see Table 26-1). Hypoxia is thus a major problem at the summit of Mount Everest.

Air Travel Pressurized cabins in passenger planes maintain an ambient pressure equivalent to $\sim 1800 \mathrm{~m}$ of altitude ( $\sim 79 \%$ of sea-level pressure) in cross-continental flights, or $\sim 2400 \mathrm{~m}$ of altitude ( $\sim 74 \%$ of sea-level pressure) in transoceanic flights. Considering that most people do not need supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the inspired air at Denver ( $\sim 1500 \mathrm{~m}$ ) or at some ski resorts ( $\sim 3000 \mathrm{~m}$ ), most airline passengers are not bothered by the slight reduction in arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation ( $89 \%$ saturation at 3000 m ) associated with these airline cabin pressures. However, passengers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see Box 27-2) may need to carry supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ onto the plane even if they do not require it at sea level.

## Up to modest altitudes, arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content falls relatively less than PB due to the shape of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve

Although PB and ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ decrease by the same fraction with increasing altitude, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of Hb in arterial blood decreases relatively little at altitudes up to $\sim 3000 \mathrm{~m}$. The reason is that at this altitude, arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is 60 to 70 mm Hg , which corresponds to the relatively flat portion of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{Hb}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-3), so that arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is little affected. Thus, the characteristics of Hb protect the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content, despite modest reductions of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. At higher altitudes, where arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content falls more steeply, aviators are advised to breathe supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

Although the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood leaving the lung is important, even more important is the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that the systemic tissues extract. This uptake is the product of cardiac output and the arteriovenous ( $\mathrm{a}-\mathrm{v}$ ) difference in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content (see Equation 29-7). At sea level, arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, corresponding to an Hb saturation of $\sim 97.5 \%$, whereas the mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, corresponding to an Hb saturation of $\sim 75 \%$. The difference between the arterial and the venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contents is $\sim 22.5 \%$ of Hb's maximal carrying capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. However, at an altitude of 3000 m , arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is only $\sim 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which may correspond to

an Hb saturation of only $88 \%$. This reduction in blood $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is called hypoxemia. Assuming that everything else remains the same (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ utilization by the tissues, hematocrit, 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate levels, pH , cardiac output), then the mixed a-v difference in Hb saturation must still be $22.5 \%$. Thus, the mixed-venous blood at 3000 m must have an Hb saturation of $88 \%-22.5 \%=65.5 \%$, which corresponds to a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 33 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. As a result, the a-v difference of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressure is much larger at sea level ( 100 $-40=60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) than at $3000 \mathrm{~m}(60-33=27 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg})$, even though the a-v difference in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is the same. The reason for the discrepancy is that the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{Hb}$ dissociation curve is steeper in the region covered by the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values at high altitude. (1) N01-22

At very high altitudes, still another factor comes into play. The uptake of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ by pulmonary-capillary blood slows at high altitudes, which reflects the smaller $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gradient from alveolus to blood (see Fig. 30-10D). As a result, at sufficiently high altitudes, particularly during exercise, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ may no longer reach diffusion equilibrium between alveolar air and pulmonary-capillary blood by the time the blood reaches the end of the capillary. Thus, at increasing altitude, not only does alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-and hence the maximal attainable arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-fall in a predictable way, but also the actual arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ may fall to an even greater extent because of a failure of pulmonary-capillary blood to equilibrate with alveolar air.

## During the first few days at altitude, compensatory adjustments to hypoxemia include tachycardia and hyperventilation

A reduction in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors (see pp. 710-713) and causes an immediate increase in ventilation, which has two effects. First, it brings alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (and thus arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ) closer to the ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Second, hyperventilation blows off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, producing a respiratory alkalosis (see p. 680) that inhibits the peripheral but especially the central chemoreceptors and thereby decreases ventilatory drive (see pp. 709-717). Thus, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}$ during an acute exposure to an altitude of 4500 m is only about twice that at sea level, whereas the hypoxia by itself would have produced a much larger stimulation. Accompanying the increased ventilatory drive during acute altitude exposure is an increase in heart rate, probably owing to the heightened sympathetic drive that accompanies acute hypoxemia (see p. 545). The resultant increase in cardiac output enhances $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery.

During the next few days to weeks at an elevation of 4500 m , acclimatization causes ventilation to increase progressively by about the same amount as the acute response. As a result, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ continues to rise, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, to fall. Two mechanisms appear to cause this slower phase of increased ventilation. First, the pH of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) decreases, which counteracts the respiratory alkalosis induced by the increase in ventilation and thus offsets the inhibition of central chemoreceptors. However, the time course of the pH decrease in CSF does not correlate tightly with the time course of the increase in ventilation. The pH at the actual site of the central chemoreceptors may fall with the appropriate time course. Long-term hypoxia appears to increase the sensitivity of the peripheral
chemoreceptors to hypoxia, and this effect may better account for acclimatization.

In the second mechanism for acclimatization, the kidneys respond over a period of several days to the respiratory alkalosis by decreasing their rate of acid secretion (see pp. 832833) so that blood pH decreases toward normal (i.e., metabolic compensation for respiratory alkalosis). Another result of this compensation is that the unreabsorbed $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ produces an osmotic diuresis and an alkaline urine. The consequence of reducing both CSF and plasma pH is to remove part of the inhibition caused by alkaline pH and thus allow hypoxia to drive ventilation to higher values.

An extreme case of adaptation to high altitude occurs in people climbing very high mountains. In 1981, a team of physiologists ascended to the peak of Mount Everest. Although on their way up to the summit the climbers breathed supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, at the summit they obtained alveolar gas samples while breathing ambient air-trapping exhaled air in an evacuated metal container. The alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ at the summit was a minuscule 7 to 8 mm Hg , or $\sim 20 \%$ of the value of 40 mm Hg at sea level. Thus, assuming a normal rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production, the climbers' alveolar ventilation would have been 5 -fold higher than normal (see pp. 679-680). Because the work of heavy breathing and increased cardiac output at the summit (driven by hypoxia) would increase $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production substantially, the increase in alveolar ventilation must have been much greater than 5 -fold.

The climbers' alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at the peak of Mount Everest was $\sim 28 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which is marginally adequate to provide a sufficient arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content to sustain the resting metabolic requirement at the summit. However, the term resting is somewhat of a misnomer, because the work of breathing and the cardiac output are markedly elevated.

## Long-term adaptations to altitude include increases in hematocrit, pulmonary diffusing capacity, capillarity, and oxidative enzymes

Although the increases in ventilation and cardiac output help to maintain $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery during acute hypoxia, they are costly from an energy standpoint and cannot be sustained for extended periods. During prolonged residence at a high altitude, the reduced arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ triggers profound adaptations that enhance $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to tissues at a cost that is lower than that exacted by short-term compensatory strategies. Many of these adaptations are mediated by an increase in hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that activates genes involved in erythropoiesis, angiogenesis, and other processes.

Hematocrit Red blood cell (RBC) mass slowly increases with prolonged hypoxemia. The Hb concentration of blood increases from a sea-level value of 14 to $15 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ to $>18 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$, and hematocrit increases from $40 \%$ to $45 \%$ to $>55 \%$. Normally, the body regulates RBC mass within fairly tight limits. However, renal hypoxia and norepinephrine stimulate the production and release of erythropoietin (EPO) from fibroblast-like cells in the kidney (see pp. 431-433). EPO is a growth factor that stimulates production of proerythroblasts in bone marrow and also promotes accelerated development of RBCs from their progenitor cells. (1) N18-2

# N61-22 Capillary-Tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ Gradients 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

The oxygen tension or (partial pressure, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ) in mixed-venous blood-a measure of average end-capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-is normally 40 mm Hg , sufficient to allow $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse into the tissue cells. Although mitochondria can use $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ down to very low levels, the radial $O_{2}$ diffusion gradient between capillary blood and cell surfaces becomes barely sufficient when the mixedvenous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $\leq 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. A sign of tissue hypoxia would be lactic acidosis.

Oxygen electrodes measure $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in arterial or venous blood samples. The difference between arterial and mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is a measure of the average axial $O_{2}$ gradient along systemic capillaries. Note that finger pulse oximeters measure the oxyhemoglobin saturation in the pulsating (i.e., arterial) blood that rushes into the tissue of the finger (see Box 29-2).

At high altitude, the fall in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ causes a reflex hyperventilation that lowers arterial and thus tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and thereby increases the affinity of Hb for oxygen. By itself, this Bohr effect (see p. 652) would further lower tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Conversely, raising tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ raises tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by displacing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from Hb .

Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity Acclimatization to high altitude also causes a 2- to 3-fold increase in pulmonary diffusing capacity (see p. 668). Much of this increase appears to result from a rise in the blood volume of pulmonary capillaries (see p. 664) and from the associated increase in capillary surface area available for diffusion (see p. 661). This surface area expands even further because hypoxia stimulates an increase in the depth of inspiration. Finally, right ventricular hypertrophy raises pulmonary arterial pressure, thereby increasing perfusion to the upper regions of the lungs (see Fig. 31-9).

Capillary Density Hypoxia causes a dramatic increase in tissue vascularity. Tissue angiogenesis (see pp. 481-482) occurs within days of exposure to hypoxia, triggered by growth factors released by hypoxic tissues. Among these angiogenic factors are vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and angiogenin.

Oxidative Enzymes Hypoxia promotes expression of oxidative enzymes in the mitochondria, thereby enhancing the tissues' ability to extract $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the blood (see pp. 12201222). Thus, acclimatization to high altitude increases not only $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the periphery but also $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the tissues.

## High altitude causes mild symptoms in most people and acute or chronic mountain sickness in susceptible individuals

Symptoms of Hypoxia The first documented evidence of the ill effects of high altitude was in 35 BC , when Chinese travelers called the Himalayas the "Headache Mountains." Recreational mountain climbing became popular in the mid19th century, and with modern transportation, many people can now travel rapidly to mountain resorts. In fact, it is possible to ascend passively from sea level to high altitude in a matter of minutes (e.g., in a balloon) to hours. A rapid ascent may precipitate a constellation of relatively mild symptoms: drowsiness, fatigue, headache, nausea, and a gradual decline in cognition. These uncomfortable effects of acute hypoxia are progressive with increasing altitude. They occur in some people at altitudes as low as 2100 m and occur in most people at altitudes higher than 3500 m . Initially, these symptoms reflect an inadequate response (i.e., compensatory hyperventilation) to hypoxemia, which results in insufficient $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the brain. In the longer term, symptoms may stem from mild cerebral edema, which probably results from dilation of the cerebral arterioles leading to increased capillary filtration pressure and enhanced transudation (see p. 468).

Acute Mountain Sickness Some people who ascend rapidly to altitudes as seemingly moderate as 3000 to 3500 m develop acute mountain sickness (AMS). The constellation of symptoms is more severe than those described in the previous paragraph and includes headache, fatigue, dizziness, dyspnea, sleep disturbance, peripheral edema, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms usually develop within the first day and last for 3 to 5 days. The primary problem in AMS is hypoxia, and the symptoms probably have two causes. The first is thought to be a progressive, more severe case of cerebral edema. The second cause of the symptoms is pulmonary edema, which occurs as hypoxia leads to hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (see p. 687), which in turn increases total pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary-capillary pressure, and transudation. Certain people have an exaggerated pulmonary vascular response to hypoxia, and they are especially susceptible to AMS. Cerebral or pulmonary edema can be fatal if the exposure to hypoxia is not rapidly reversed, first by providing supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to breathe and then by removing the individual from the high altitude.

Although being physically fit provides some protection against AMS, the most important factor is an undefined constitutional difference. Persons who are least likely to develop symptoms ventilate more in response to the hypoxia and therefore tend to have a higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and a lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ lead to less cerebral vasodilation, and the higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ minimizes pulmonary vasoconstriction. (○) N61-23

Chronic Mountain Sickness After prolonged residence at high altitude, chronic mountain sickness may develop. The cause of this disorder is an overproduction of RBCs-an exaggerated response to hypoxia. In such conditions, the hematocrit can exceed $60 \%$-polycythemia-which dramatically increases blood viscosity and vascular resistance, and increases the risk of intravascular thrombosis. The combination of pulmonary hypoxic vasoconstriction and increased blood viscosity is especially onerous for the right heart, which experiences a greatly increased load. These conditions eventually lead to congestive heart failure of the right ventricle. (○) N61-23

## FLIGHT AND SPACE PHYSIOLOGY

## Acceleration in one direction shifts the blood volume in the opposite direction

To accelerate a rocket from rest, we must apply enough force to overcome its inertial force (i.e., its weight, the product of its mass, and the acceleration caused by gravity), as well as the frictional forces of the environment. This requirement is merely a restatement of Newton's second law of motion. (○) N61-10 With the rocket accelerating vertically, astronauts inside experience an inertial $G$ force (see p. 1225), as required by Newton's third law, a force that presses the astronauts into their seats in the direction opposite that of the rocket's acceleration.

Before liftoff, an astronaut experiences only the force of gravity, +1 G . As a rocket blasts off from earth, the astronaut experiences higher G forces. In early rockets, astronauts sometimes experienced G forces as high as +10 G . Maximal G forces in the space shuttle were only approximately +4 G (Fig. 61-7). Similarly, pilots of high-performance aircraft experience positive G forces as they pull out of a dive, and we all experience negative G forces when an aircraft hits turbulence, suddenly loses altitude, and lifts us out of our seats. Although G forces can frequently have potentially large effects on aircraft pilots, they affect astronauts only during the liftoff and re-entry phases of space flight. To ensure that acceleration effects have a minimal influence on body

Figure 61-7 G forces during ascent into space on the space shuttle. Before liftoff, astronauts experience +1 G , the acceleration that is due to earth's gravity. After liftoff, the solid rockets burn for -2 minutes, during which time the G force ramps up to slightly more than +3 G . After the solid-rocket burn, the G force falls back to +1 G . Thereafter, the main engine gradually builds up the G force to about +4 G before engine cutoff. These G-force data were generated in a human centrifuge to simulate the profile of a shuttle launch.

function, astronauts sit with their backs perpendicular to the direction of the accelerating force, so the G force acts across the chest from front to back. (1) N61-24

G forces propel the body's tissues in the direction opposite that of acceleration; these forces compress soft tissues against underlying structural elements (e.g., bone) or pull these tissues away from overlying structural elements. In addition, G forces tend to shift the blood volume away from the direction of acceleration, thereby adding to the other component forces that determine blood pressure (see p. 414).

In high-performance aircraft, the rapid motions associated with changes in flight direction or altitude produce G forces that can be considerable for several minutes, exceeding 8G. Even in relatively primitive aircraft, aerobatic maneuvers can shift blood volume away from the head, resulting in transient reductions in cerebral blood flow and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery. If these reductions are sufficiently large, they can result in loss of consciousness. The early warnings of such an event are narrowing of the visual field (i.e., loss of peripheral vision) and loss of color perception as the retina is deprived of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, a phenomenon called gray-out. The term blackout describes a total loss of consciousness that occurs during acceleration that lasts for tens of seconds or minutes. Pilots experiencing gray-out or blackout are at extreme risk. As early as World War II, fighter pilots used G suits that provided counterpressure to the lower extremities during repeated tight maneuvers during dogfights. The counterpressure opposed the pooling of blood in the extremities and maintained sufficient cardiac filling, cardiac output, and blood flow to the brain, thereby eliminating the tendency toward gray-out.

## "Weightlessness" causes a cephalad shift of the blood volume and an increase in urine output

An astronaut in an orbiting spacecraft experiences "weightlessness," a state of near-zero G force, also called a microgravity environment. Although an astronaut at an altitude of 200 km still experiences $\sim 94 \%$ of the force of the earth's gravity at sea level (i.e., the astronaut truly has weight), the centrifugal force of the spacecraft's orbital trajectory balances the earth's gravitational force, and the astronaut experiences no net acceleration forces and thus has the sensation of weightlessness. This weightlessness, however, differs from the true near-zero-gravity environment in "outer space."

We are adapted to life at +1 G , and arteriolar tone in the lower extremities prevents pooling of blood in the capacitance vessels, thereby ensuring adequate venous return to the right heart (see p. 576). The acute effects of microgravity on the circulatory system are exactly what one would expect for a system designed to oppose the effect of gravity in a standing person: blood volume redistributes toward the head. This cephalad shift of blood volume-away from the capacitance vessels of the legs-expands the central blood volume, increasing the cardiac preload and increasing the filtration of plasma water into the interstitium of the facial region. The resulting edema explains the dramatically bloated facial appearance of astronauts in microgravity within 24 hours of the launch. From this discussion, one would think that the central venous pressure (CVP) is higher in space. However, such an increase in CVP has been difficult to confirm.

In laboratory studies involving prolonged head-down tilt (i.e., a model intended to simulate microgravity exposure), the cephalad shift of blood volume produces the expected increase in CVP and rapid reflex responses to the apparent volume overload. First, the increased stretch on the right atrium causes release of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP; see p. 547). Second, stimulation of the low-pressure baroreceptors inhibits secretion of arginine vasopressin, or antidiuretic hormone (see p. 547), from the posterior pituitary. These two events increase excretion of salt and water by the kidneys (see pp. 838-840), which tends to correct the perceived volume overload and explains the tendency for astronauts to remain relatively underhydrated during space flight.

In orbiting spacecraft, the cephalad shift of blood volume, even without an increase in CVP, causes a small increase in cerebral arterial pressure and thus in blood flow to the brain. Such regional alterations in blood volume and flow do not substantially impact total peripheral resistance in space. Thus, mean arterial pressure and cardiac output are not significantly different from their values on the earth's surface.

## Space flight leads to motion sickness and to decreases in muscle and bone mass

Despite training (e.g., in three-dimensional motion simulators), more than half of all astronauts experience motion sickness during the initial days of microgravity. Motion sickness (i.e., nausea and vomiting) results from conflicting sensory input to the brain regarding the position of the body. In space flight, motion sickness is the consequence of altered inertial stimulation of the vestibular system in the absence of normal gravitational forces. Nearly all cases of motion sickness resolve within the first 96 hours of microgravity exposure as the vestibular system or the CNS accommodates to the novel input.

The increased cerebral blood flow and blood volume in microgravity, accompanied by increased capillary filtration of fluid from the intravascular space, contribute to the

# N61-24 Effects of Acceleration on Astronauts 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois

If we sit in a human centrifuge with acceleration directed from head to foot, and if the seat pushes headward by the same force, blood drains from our heads and we nearly pass out at +4 G . Fighter pilots wear tight leggings with air bladders inside inflated to support the circulation, which extends tolerance an extra +2 G . Some pilots in an aircraft undergoing a tight turn can withstand up to +8 G or +9 G by straining to provoke vasoconstriction. Astronauts in takeoff or landing mode lie transversely to the acceleration or deceleration to be able to tolerate up to 9 G . But above 10 G , they can hardly move the chest wall to breathe.

increased incidence of headache, nausea, and motion sickness, at least during the period of transition to microgravity. These symptoms reduce performance. Astronauts attempt to minimize these effects by restricting water intake before launch.

Numerous other changes occur during prolonged residence in microgravity, many of which are related to the markedly diminished aerobic power output in space, where the force of gravity does not oppose muscle contraction. The major physiological alterations include reductions in body water content, plasma and RBC volume, total-body nitrogen stores, muscle mass, and total-body calcium and phosphate (associated with a loss in bone mass). The bone loss appears to be continuous during time in a weightless environment, whereas the other changes occur only during the first weeks in space. The reductions in plasma and RBC volumes result in a marked decrease in maximal cardiac output (see pp. 1214-1215), a determinant of maximal aerobic power. The reduction of muscle mass decreases the maximal force developed by muscle. The reduction in bone mass similarly decreases bone strength. Although these changes are appropriate adaptations to a microgravity environment, in which great strength and high aerobic capacity have little inherent value, they are decidedly disadvantageous on return to the earth's surface. Prolonged bed rest simulates weightlessness by causing loss of calcium from the bones and protein from the muscles.

## Exercise partially overcomes the deconditioning of muscles during space flight

The intermittent loading of muscles, bone, and the cardiovascular system prevents-to some extent-the deconditioning effects of space flight on muscle mass and performance. Astronauts have used bungee (i.e., elastic) cords and ergometric (i.e., work-measuring) stationary bicycles to provide resistance against which to exert force. The most effective exercise regimen appears to be walking on a motor-driven treadmill with the lower body encased in a negative-pressure chamber. Reducing the chamber pressure to 100 mm Hg lower than ambient pressure creates transmural pressure differences across the blood vessels in the feet that are similar to pressure differences when standing upright on the earth's surface. However, this arrangement greatly exaggerates transmural pressure differences near the waist. For this reason, the astronauts also wear positive-pressure pants that
compress the tissues by 70 mm Hg at the level of the waist and decrease the compression decrementally to 0 mm Hg at the feet. The net effect of the negative-pressure chamber and the graded positive-pressure pants is to create a physiological toe-to-waist gradient of transmural pressures across the blood vessels of the lower body. The aerobic activity, the impact of the feet on the treadmill, and the generation of physiological transmural pressure gradients appear to be sufficient to simulate exercise at +1 G . This regimen can reduce or even eliminate the deconditioning effects of space flight.

## Return to earth requires special measures to maintain arterial blood pressure

The problems associated with re-entry reflect a return to full gravity on earth's surface. The most dramatic effects result from reduced blood volume and decreased tone of the leg vessels. Both factors contribute to reductions in cardiac preload, orthostatic tolerance, and exercise capacity. It has been common practice to shield astronauts from public view immediately after return to the earth's surface, until they have regained a good orthostatic response.

In recent years, astronauts have employed various strategies just before re-entry to counter the adaptations to microgravity. The countermeasure to orthostatic intolerance is restoration of blood volume before re-entry. One means of attenuating the reduction of blood volume in space flight is an exercise program. Even a brief period (e.g., 30 minutes) of intense exercise expands plasma albumin content (see p. 1220), increasing plasma oncotic pressure and plasma volume by $10 \%$ within 24 hours. The problems with exercise programs are difficulties in logistics and the astronauts' lack of motivation. A second means of minimizing the reduced blood volume is increasing salt and fluid intake. However, this practice has proven difficult to implement because of the consequent increase in urine flow. Currently, astronauts are educated about the effects of prolonged space flight and then are maintained under continuous observation after re-entry until they have regained a normal orthostatic response. This usually occurs within hours, and certainly within 1 day, of re-entry.

# THE PHYSIOLOGY OF AGING 

Edward J. Masoro

Biomedical science paid surprisingly little attention to a remarkable change in human biology during the 20th century-the marked increase of human life expectancy (1) N62-1 in developed nations. Life expectancy is the projected mean length of life of those born in a given calendar year (e.g., 1984)—or those of a particular age (e.g., 30 years)—computed from the mortality characteristics of the entire population in a particular year (e.g., 2016). In the United States, life expectancy for men progressively increased from 47.9 years in 1900 to 76.4 years in 2012, and for women, from 50.7 years in 1900 to 81.2 years in 2012. (2) N62-2

## CONCEPTS IN AGING

## During the 20th century, the age structure of populations in developed nations shifted toward older individuals

The fraction of the U.S. population $\geq 65$ years of age was only $4 \%$ in 1900 but $12.4 \%$ in 2000 . This trend in age structure is projected to continue (Fig. 62-1). Moreover, because women have a greater life expectancy, they comprised $70.5 \%$ of the population $>80$ years of age in 1990 in developed nations.

The shift in the age structure of the U.S. population during the 20th century depended only modestly on an increase in life expectancy from birth. More important was the progressive decrease in birth rates. As a result, the elderly have become an ever-increasing fraction of the population, particularly in developed nations. Indeed, the effect of the postWorld War II "baby boom" generation on population age structure is clearly apparent in Figure 62-1. If birth rates do not fall much further, future changes in the age structure of the U.S. population will depend mainly on further increases in life expectancy. (3) N62-3

## The definition, occurrence, and measurement of aging are fundamental but controversial issues

The age of an organism usually refers to the length of time the individual has existed. Biogerontologists and members of the general public alike usually use aging to mean the process of senescence. For example, we may say that a person is young for her age, an expression meaning that the processes of senescence appear to be occurring slowly in that person. Aging-the synonym for senescence that we use throughout this chapter-is the progressive deteriorative
changes during the adult period of life that underlie an increasing vulnerability to challenges and thereby decrease the ability of the organism to survive.

Biogerontologists distinguish biological age from chronological age. Although we easily recognize the biological aging of family members, friends, and pets, it would be helpful to have a quantitative measure of the rate of aging of an individual. Biomarkers of aging-morphological and functional changes that occur with time in the adult organism-could in principle serve as a measure of senescent deterioration. Alas, a generally agreed-on panel of biomarkers of aging has yet to emerge, so it is currently impossible to quantitate the aging of individuals.

Although measuring the aging of individuals is difficult, it has long been possible to measure the rate of aging of populations. In 1825, Benjamin Gompertz, a British actuary, published a report on the human age-specific death raterthe fraction of the population entering an age interval (e.g., 60 to 61 years of age) that dies during the age interval. For the British population, Gompertz found that, after early adulthood, the age-specific death rate increases exponentially with increasing adult age. The same is true for other human populations (Fig. 62-2) and for many animal populations. Based on the assumption that the death rate reflects the vulnerability caused by senescence, it has generally been accepted that the slope of the curve in Figure 62-2 reflects the rate of population aging. Although gompertzian and related analyses had long been viewed as the "gold standard" for measuring population aging, some biogerontologists have challenged this approach.

## Aging is an evolved trait

Most evolutionary biologists no longer accept the once popular belief that aging is an evolutionary adaptation with a genetic program similar to that for development. The current view is that aging evolved by default as the result of the absence of forces of natural selection that might otherwise eliminate mutations that promote senescence. For example, consider a cohort of a species that reaches reproductive maturity at age X. At that age, all members of the cohort will be involved in generating progeny. Furthermore, assume that this species is evolving in a hostile environmentthe case for most species. As the age of this cohort increases past X , fewer and fewer members survive so that all members of the cohort die before exhibiting senescence. In this cohort,

## N62-1 Life Expectancy

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Human life-expectancy data-such as those cited in the first paragraphs of this chapter-are computed from mortality data for a particular year (e.g., 2002)—that is, the ages of all people who happen to have died in a particular year. Note that some of these individuals who died in 2002 were born in 2002, and some were born in 1900. The first step in computing life expectancy is to use the mortality data of 2002, for example, to compute age-specific death rates, from which we can derive a variety of other statistics. For example, we can compute the life expectancy at a particular age. The life expectancy at birth in the United States in 2002 was 74.5 years for men and 79.9 years for women. However, based on 2012 data, the life expectancy at birth in the United States had already risen to 76.4 for men and 81.2 for women. Clearly, these life expectancies are not predictions about how long someone alive today will live. Rather, they are death rates that are frozen in time.

Another way of approaching the question is to analyze an extinct cohort, such as all those born in the year 1800. Based on the age at death of each member of this cohort, we could compute the true life expectancy of those born in the year 1800. Note that it is impossible-today-to predict the true life expectancy of those born in the year 2000 because that cohort is not extinct.

## N62-2 National Institute on Aging

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

Responding to the increase in life expectancy, the United States in 1974 established the National Institute on Aging (NIA) in the National Institutes of Health. The NIA has had a major impact in the United States and throughout the world in the promotion of research on aging and in the development of geriatric medicine.

## N62-3 Socioeconomic Impact of a Graying Population

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

There is concern that the increasing fraction of the population $\geq 65$ years will have a negative socioeconomic impact. Part of the potential problem is cultural in that individuals expect to exit the work force at or around 65 years of age. Also, with advancing age, there is progressive deterioration of physiological capacity and an increasing prevalence of age-associated diseases. Thus, with advancing age, individuals need greater assistance in living and more medical care. In the United States, hospital admissions in 1993 for those $>65$ years of age were more than twice the admissions for those 45 to 64 years of age.

genes with detrimental actions expressed only at advanced ages would not be subjected to natural selection. If we now move the progeny of our cohort to a highly protective environment, many may well live to ages at which the deleterious genes can express their effects, thereby giving rise to the aging phenotype. This general concept led biologists to put forward three genetic mechanisms that we discuss in the following three paragraphs. These are not mutually exclusive, and each has experimental support.

In 1952, Peter Medawar (C) N62-4 proposed a variant of the foregoing model, now referred to as the mutationaccumulation mechanism. He proposed that most deleterious mutations in gametes will result in progeny that are defective during most of life, and natural selection removes
such genes from the population. However, a very few of mutated genes will not have deleterious effects until advanced ages, and natural selection would fail to eliminate such genes.

George Williams proposed another variant in 1957. He postulated that the genes that have deleterious actions in late life actually increase evolutionary fitness in early adulthood. Natural selection will strongly favor such alleles because they promote the ability of the young adult to generate progeny and because they have a negative impact only after reproduction-antagonistic pleiotropy. In this scenario, aging is a byproduct of natural selection.

In 1977, Tom Kirkwood proposed the disposable soma theory, according to which the fundamental life role of organisms is to generate progeny. Natural selection would

apportion the use of available energy between reproduction and body (i.e., somatic) maintenance to maximize the individual's lifetime yield of progeny. As a consequence, less energy is available for somatic maintenance than needed for indefinite survival. This theory further proposes that a hostile environment increases the fraction of energy expended in reproduction, so that a smaller fraction is left for somatic maintenance.

## Human aging studies can be cross-sectional or longitudinal

Measuring the effects of aging on the human physiology presents investigators with a difficulty-the subjects' life span is longer than the investigator's scientific life span.

Cross-Sectional Design The usual approach to the foregoing difficulty is a cross-sectional design in which investigators study cohorts with several different age ranges (e.g., 20 - to 29 -year-olds, 30 - to 39 -year-olds) over a brief period (e.g., a calendar year). However, this design suffers from two serious potential confounders. One is the cohort effect; that is, different cohorts have had different environmental experiences. For example, in studies of the effects of aging on cognition, a confounding factor could be that younger cohorts have had the benefit of a relatively higher level of education. If aware of a potential confounder, the investigator may be able to modify the study's design to avoid the confounder.

The second potential confounder is selective mortalityindividuals with risk factors for diseases that cause death at a relatively young age are underrepresented in older age groups. For example, in a study on the effect of age on plasma lipoproteins, mortality at a young age from cardiovascular disease would preferentially eliminate individuals with the highest low-density lipoprotein levels.

Longitudinal Design To circumvent the confounders encountered in cross-sectional designs, investigators can repeatedly study a subject over a significant portion of his or her lifetime. However, this longitudinal design has other problems. Long-term longitudinal studies require a special organizational structure that can outlive an individual investigator and ensure completion of the study. Even shorter longitudinal studies are very costly. Some problems are inherent in the time course of longitudinal studies, including the effect of repeated measurements on the function being assessed, changes in subjects' lifestyle (e.g., diet), dropout of subjects from the study, and changes in professional personnel and technology.

## Whether age-associated diseases are an integral part of aging remains controversial

Age-associated diseases are those that do not cause morbidity or mortality until advanced ages. Examples are coronary artery disease, stroke, many cancers, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, cataracts, Alzheimer disease, and Parkinson disease. These are either chronic diseases or acute diseases that result from long-term processes (e.g., atherogenesis).

Most gerontologists have held the view that age-associated diseases are not an integral part of aging. These gerontologists developed the concept of primary and secondary aging to explain why age-associated diseases occur in almost all elderly people. Primary aging refers to intrinsic changes occurring with age, unrelated to disease or environmental influences. Secondary aging refers to changes caused by the interaction of primary aging with environmental influences or disease processes.

In contrast, some gerontologists adhere to a view expressed by Robin Holliday: "The distinction between agerelated changes that are not pathological and those that are pathological is not at all fundamental." Moreover, the genetic mechanisms proposed for the evolution of aging (see p . 1235) may apply equally to the processes underlying both primary and secondary aging.

## CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF AGING

In this subchapter, we consider three major classes of cellular and molecular processes that may be proximate causes of organismic aging: (1) damage caused by oxidative stress and other factors, (2) inadequate repair of damage, and (3) dysregulation of cell number. No one of these is the underlying mechanism of aging. The basic mechanism of aging is likely to be the long-term imbalance between damage and repair. During growth and development, the genetic program not only creates a complex structure, but also repairs damaged molecules that arise in the process. Following development is a brief adult period when damage and repair are in balance, and then begins a long-term imbalance in favor of damage.

The factors underlying the imbalance vary among species and among individuals within species, as a result of both genetic and environmental variability. For example, oxidative stress is one of many damaging processes that underlie aging, but an individual's genome and environment determine the extent to which it is an important causal factor.

## Oxidative stress and related processes that damage macromolecules may have a causal role in aging

Raymond Pearl in 1928 proposed that organisms have a finite amount of a "vital principle," which they deplete at a rate proportional to the rate of energy expenditure. Although this once-dominant "rate of living" theory of aging has now been discarded, some of its concepts helped to spawn the oxidative stress theory of aging. (1) N62-5

Reactive Oxygen Species As illustrated in Figure 62-3A, reactive oxygen species (ROS) include molecules such as hydrogen peroxide $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, neutral free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}\right)$, and anionic radicals such as the superoxide anion radical $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}\right)$. Free radicals have an

unpaired electron in the outer orbital, shown in red in Figure 62-3A. These free radicals are extremely unstable because they react with a target molecule to capture an electron, so that they become a stable molecule with only paired electrons in the outer shell. However, the target molecule left behind becomes a free radical, which initiates a chain reaction that continues until two free radicals meet to create a product with a covalent bond. ROS-particularly ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$, which is the most reactive of them all-have the potential to damage important biological molecules, such as proteins, lipids, and DNA. However, ROS also play important physiological roles in the oxidation of iodide anions by thyroid peroxidase in the formation of thyroid hormone (see pp. 1006-1010), as well as in the destruction of certain bacteria by reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and myeloperoxidase in phagocytic cells. (1) N62-6 Finally, the highly reactive signaling molecule nitric oxide (see p. 66) is a free radical (see Fig. 62-3A). (1) N62-7

Quantitatively, the most important source of ROS is the mitochondrial electron transport chain (see p. 118). Complex I and complex III of the electron transport chain generate $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$as byproducts (see Fig. 62-3B). The enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) converts $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$to hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can yield the highly reactive ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{OH}$.

Only a small fraction of the oxygen used in aerobic metabolism ( $<1 \%$ ) generates ROS. However, even that amount would be lethal in the absence of protective mechanisms. Fortunately, organisms have two potent antioxidant defenses. The major defense is enzymatic, specifically SODs, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (Fig. 62-4). In addition, low-molecular-weight antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, play a minor role in the defense against the metabolically produced radicals.

Because these antioxidant defense mechanisms are not fully protective, the dominant concept of the oxidative stress theory is that an imbalance between the production and

SODs eliminate the superoxide radical but generate hydrogen peroxide, which, as shown in Figure 62-3B, can yield the highly reactive hydroxyl radical via the Fenton reaction. The hydrogen peroxide is eliminated by catalase or glutathione peroxidase, which yield relatively nonreactive products: water, molecular oxygen, and oxidized glutathione.

## N62-5 Free-Radical Theory of Aging

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

Also contributing to the development of the oxidative stress theory of aging was the free-radical theory of aging. In 1954, Denham Harman published an article setting forth the freeradical theory of aging. Free radicals are highly reactive chemical entities containing unpaired outer orbital electrons. Harman proposed that free radicals are generated in living organisms from both endogenous and exogenous sources. He theorized that these highly reactive entities damage biologically important molecules, resulting in aging.

removal of ROS by antioxidant defenses is the major cause of aging. Nevertheless, recent studies using genetically engineered mice-with either deficient or overexpressed antioxidant enzymes-do not support this theory.

Glycation and Glycoxidation Glycation refers to nonenzymatic reactions between the carbonyl groups of reducing sugars (e.g., glucose) and the amino groups of macromolecules (e.g., proteins, DNA) to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). Figure 62-5 shows an interaction of openchain D-glucose with a lysine residue on a protein, yielding a Schiff base and water. The Schiff base undergoes an intramolecular rearrangement to form an open-chain Amadori compound that undergoes the Amadori rearrangement to form a ring structure called an Amadori product. In cooking, Amadori products undergo a series of further reactions to produce polymers and copolymers called melanoidins, which give a brown color to cooked food. (5) N62-8 In humans, the Amadori product can undergo a series of intramolecular and intermolecular rearrangements that include oxidation-glycoxidation-to form AGE molecules. For example, the Amadori product in Figure 62-5 can either form carboxymethyllysine or react with an arginine residue on the same or a different protein to form a cross-link called pentosidine.

The formation of AGEs is especially important for longlived proteins and appears to play a role in the long-term complications of diabetes. The similarity between the aging phenotype and that of the diabetic patient led Anthony Cerami to propose the glycation hypothesis of aging. Although glucose is not the only reducing sugar involved in
glycation, it is an important one. Thus, the level of glycemia is a major factor in glycation, and periods of hyperglycemia are probably the reason glycation-including the glycation of hemoglobin (see Box 29-1)-is enhanced in patients with diabetes. Proteins containing AGEs exhibit altered structural and functional properties. For example, AGE formation in lens proteins of the eye probably contributes to age-associated opacification. Moreover, with advancing age, the increased stiffness of collagen in connective tissues (e.g., blood vessels; see pp. 458-459) may also, in part, be due to AGE-mediated collagen cross-links. AGE-induced DNA damage may lead to alterations in genomic function.

Mitochondrial Damage Because mitochondria are the major source of ROS, they are also likely to be a major target of oxidative damage. Damage to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) increases greatly with age because, unlike genomic DNA, mtDNA is not protected by histones (see pp. 75-76). According to the mitochondrial theory of aging, the damage to mtDNA reduces the ability of the mitochondria to generate ATP, and this decreased production of ATP results in the loss of cell function and hence aging.

Somatic Mutations Damage to genomic and mitochondrial DNA can occur as the result of radiation and other environmental agents, such as toxic chemicals. In recent years, oxidative stress has been recognized as a major source of DNA damage. Cells can repair much of the damage to DNA, and the level of damage is in a steady state between damaging and repair processes. According to the DNA damage theory of aging, accumulated DNA damage

# N62-8 Maillard Reaction 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the Maillard reaction, the amino group of an amino acid reacts with the carbonyl group of a sugar. As shown in the left side of Figure 62-5, the products are water plus an N -substituted glycosylamine (i.e., an open-chained Amadori compound). This reaction, discovered by the physiologist Louis Camille Maillard (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_ Camille_Maillard) in the 1910s is responsible for the brown color of toast and the color of seared meat.

interferes with DNA replication and transcription, thereby impairing the ability of cells to function and causing aging. Moreover, this loss of function increases as the steady-state level of DNA damage increases with advancing age. However, it is not clear that DNA damage and mutations in somatic cells are sufficient to cause the organismic functional deterioration that characterizes the aging phenotype.

## Inadequacy of repair processes may contribute to the aging phenotype

Many biogerontologists believe that even more important than damage per se is the progressive age-associated loss in the ability to repair such damage. (5) N62-9

DNA Repair As noted above, the steady-state level of damaged DNA depends on the balance between damage and repair processes. The DNA repair theory of aging proposes that DNA repair declines with advancing age, which causes a rise in the steady-state level of damaged DNA and thereby compromises the integrity of the genome. Because DNA repair is a complex process, it is difficult to measure in vivo. Moreover, not only the rate but also the accuracy of the repair processes could contribute to aging. Particularly in stem cells, unrepaired or inappropriately repaired DNA may play a major role in aging.

Protein Homeostasis In addition to oxidative stress and nonenzymatic glycation, a host of other processes-including deamidation, racemization, and isomerization-may lead to deterioration of proteins, resulting in changes in the secondary and tertiary structures as well as aggregation and fragmentation. Protecting the organism from an excessive accumulation of altered proteins are proteolytic degradation and replacement-protein turnover.

As noted beginning on page 33, cells have mechanisms for monitoring and maintaining the quality of their proteome. A major role of these mechanisms is the maintenance of the appropriate conformation of the proteins in the face of factors tending to unfold and misfold them, thereby abolishing function and often converting the protein into a toxic agent. An age-associated decrease in chaperone proteinsinvolved in protein folding and refolding-may be a factor in the accumulation of protein oligomers and aggregates. Small oligomers, not mature amyloid fibers, are believed to be the most toxic species in some age-associated diseases, such as Alzheimer disease. The ubiquitin/proteasome system (see pp. 33-34) degrades many of the proteins not refolded by the chaperones. The catalytic activity of the proteasome may decrease with age.

The rate of total-body protein turnover in humans decreases with age. Thus, the average lifetime of most but not all protein species increases with age. Long-lived proteins in the extracellular matrix, particularly collagen and elastin, undergo age-associated changes such as oxidation, glycation, and cross-linking. These changes, for cells embedded in the matrix, probably alter proliferation, migration, and the response to extracellular signals.

Autophagy Damaged proteins that are not either refolded or degraded by the ubiquitin/proteasome system may be
broken down by lysosomal proteases. In addition to proteases, lysosomes contain enzymes that can break down lipids, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. Degradation of cellular components by the lysosomes is referred to as autophagy, of which there are three types.

Macroautophagy involves the sequestering of proteins and other cytosolic components inside double-membrane vesicles called autophagosomes, the outer membrane of which fuses with a lysosome. The lysosomal enzymes degrade the cytosolic cargo.

In microautophagy, the lysosome membrane engulfs single damaged cytosolic molecules, exposing them to the lysosomal enzymes.

In chaperone-mediated autophagy, a complex of a damaged cytosolic protein and a chaperone traffics and then binds to a receptor on the lysosomal membrane. Lysosomal machinery then unfolds the protein and translocates it into the lysosome.

With increasing age, lysosomes in most tissues undergo marked changes, including an expansion of the lysosomal compartment, changes in lysosomal enzyme activities, and the accumulation of undegraded lysosomal products in the form of lipofuscin. A loss of lysosomal function adversely affects all three types of autophagy. In addition, other ageassociated defects may be specific to macroautophagy and to chaperone-mediated autophagy.

## Dysfunction of the homeostasis of cell number may be a major factor in aging

For most cell types, the total number of cells remains nearly constant over much of adult life. An imbalance in favor of cell division results in hyperplasia (see p. 990), such as occurs in the prostates of elderly men, or in neoplasia (i.e., formation of new, abnormal cells), a disease process that also increases in frequency with age. An imbalance in favor of cell removal results in a reduction of cell number, such as occurs with age in some skeletal muscles. Of course, in cell types that are truly postmitotic in adult life, any age-associated loss of cells results in a decrea se in number.

Limitations in Cell Division In 1961, Leonard Hayflick and Paul Moorhead reported that human fibroblasts in culture could divide only a limited number of times, a phenomenon known as the Hayflick limit that also applies to many other somatic cell types in culture. Although Hayflick hypothesized that this limited cell proliferation in culture is a "test tube" model of aging, more recent findings indicate that the in vitro cell-culture system falls short as a valid model of organismic aging. Nevertheless, intensive study of the Hayflick limit led to consideration of the role of telomeres in aging.

Telomeres are elements at the ends of linear chromosomes and are composed of repeated specific DNA sequences and associated proteins. In the late 1980s, Calvin Harley found that the telomeres of human cells in culture shorten with each mitotic division. When the telomeres shorten to a critical length, the cell can no longer divide-a probable basis of the Hayflick limit. Such cells also exhibit other functional changes.

Are the telomere findings in culture systems relevant to organismic senescence? A reduction in telomere length

# N62-9 Age-Associated Inadequacy of Repair Processes 

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

Those who believe in the concept of primary and secondary aging would feel that, because repair processes are an intrinsic component of an organism, their inadequate functioning is a component of primary aging. Some distinguished biogerontologists do not regard the concept of primary and secondary aging as useful. On the other hand, other distinguished biogerontologists, including some in the medical area, still subscribe to the concept.

could play a role in cell types that exhibit an age-associated decrease in cell number. Clearly, a reduction in telomere length cannot be a factor in the aging of cells that are truly postmitotic during adult life. Telomeres do not shorten in the germline, which, unlike somatic cells, contains significant levels of telomerase, an enzyme that catalyzes the extension of telomere length. Cancer cells are also rich in telomerase. For their work on telomeres and telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostak shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. (3) N62-10

Although not associated with a major dysregulation of cell number, aging may impair the burst in proliferation necessary to meet certain challenges. For example, with increasing age, the immune system is less effective in protecting the organism from infection. An important factor may be that an antigenic challenge may be less effective in triggering a proliferation of T lymphocytes, perhaps because of an age-associated decrease in the length of T-lymphocyte telomeres.

Cell Removal Necrosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis are major processes by which the body loses cells. Necrosis, a cellular response to severe trauma, is manifested by uncontrolled breakdown of cellular structure, cell lysis, and an inflammatory response. The morphological characteristics of necrosis are cell swelling and loss of membrane integrity.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death (see p. 22). (5) N62-11 It plays a key role in organogenesis and tissue renewal, and it also occurs in response to relatively mild damage. Apoptosis requires ATP, is gene driven, and is characterized by preservation of organelles, maintenance of membrane integrity, absence of inflammation, cell shrinkage, and fragmentation of the cell into multiple membraneenclosed apoptotic bodies. Macrophages or neighboring cells remove the apoptotic bodies by phagocytosis.

Three interacting pathways (5) N62-12 lead to apoptosis (Fig. 62-6). First, in the extrinsic pathway, extracellular signals bind to cell-surface receptors-death receptors (DRs)—of the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family, which are examples of receptors that act at least in part via regulated proteolysis (see p. 48). The DRs include Fas, TNFR1, DR3, DR4, and DR5, all of which have a cytosolic death domain. In the case of the receptor Fas, the homotrimeric ligand called FasL binds to three Fas molecules, which results in the formation of a trimer of ligand-receptor complexes. This clustering allows the death domains on Fas to bind to death domains of an intracellular adapter protein called FADD (Fas-associated death domain). Death-effector domains of FADD recruit several copies of procaspase-8, the aggregation of which leads to the autoproteolytic cleavage of procaspase-8 and thereby releases active caspase-8. This initiator caspase is a member of the caspase family of proteolytic enzymes. (5) N62-13 Relatively small numbers of

## N62-13 Caspases

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

Caspases are proteases with a cysteine (Cys) residue at their active site. They cleave a protein substrate at an aspartate (Asp) residue. The Cys and Asp give rise to the name caspase. They exist as inactive precursors called procaspases or zymogen caspases. Only after cleavage of the procaspase does the enzyme become active.

caspase-8 molecules, by proteolytic cleavage, activate much larger numbers of executioner caspases, including caspases 3 and 7 , as well as another initiator caspase called caspase-9. This amplified cascade results in the proteolysis of numerous cytosolic and nuclear proteins, leading to apoptosis. One caspase target is a gelsolin, which, when cleaved, severs actin filaments and leads to a loss of normal cell shape. Another caspase target is inhibitor of caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (ICAD), which normally binds to and thereby inactivates caspase-activated deoxyribonuclease (CAD). Cleavage of ICAD releases active CAD, which translocates to the nucleus and severs chromosomal DNA. ( $\$ 14$

The second pathway involves damage to the mitochondria (see Fig. 62-6), triggered by such agents as ROS, increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]$ in the mitochondrial matrix, and caspases. The result is the opening of a large pore in the mitochondrial inner membrane-the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP)-followed by mitochondrial swelling, rupture of the outer mitochondrial membrane, and release of cytochrome c into the cytosol. There, apoptotic proteaseactivating factor (Apaf-1) complexes with the cytochrome c and ATP, forming a wheel-like structure that contains seven of each molecule-an apoptosome. This structure recruits seven procaspase- 9 molecules, which results in the formation of active caspase- 9 and thus commits the cell to apoptosis.

The third pathway is triggered by damage to nuclear DNA (see Fig. 62-6). The tumor-suppressor p53, a nuclear protein, recognizes certain base-pair mismatches. In cases of modest DNA damage, p53 increases the transcription of p21, which in turn halts the cell cycle. In cases of more severe DNA damage, p53 upregulates its own transcription. In addition, p53 increases the transcription of the proapoptotic protein Bax and decreases the transcription of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio appears to activate MPTP, thereby precipitating the events leading to apoptosis described in the second pathway. Finally, p53 also upregulates Fas, which reinforces the first pathway.

Dysregulation of apoptosis promotes aging. Failure of apoptosis to remove damaged cells could result in abnormal function or increase the risk of cancer. Excess apoptosis would unnecessarily decrease cell number.

Necroptosis is a second important mode of regulated cell death. Like apoptosis, necroptosis involves a highly orchestrated sequence of intracellular signaling reactions. Notably, necroptosis is activated in response to many of the same microbial or environmental stresses that trigger apoptosis. In cells in which the stress or infectious stimuli suppress initiator caspases (e.g., caspase-8; see pp. 1241-1242) or executioner caspases (e.g., caspase-3; see pp. 1241-1242), the cells activate the necroptotic cascade as an alternative to apoptosis. Indeed, some microbial pathogens express potent inhibitors of host cell caspases, which allows the pathogens to establish protected replicative niches within infected host cells. Engagement of the necroptosis pathway facilitates death of the infected host cells with consequent release of the internalized pathogens into extracellular compartments, where multiple innate immune mechanisms more readily destroy the pathogens. These mechanisms include complementmediated cytolysis and neutrophil-mediated production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (see pp. 1238-1239).

Recently identified pronecroptotic gene products include the RIP1 and RIP3 protein kinases and the mixed-lineage kinaselike (MLKL) protein, which appears to function as an endogenous porin (see p. 109) when recruited to the plasma membrane. Ischemia-reperfusion injury of organs such as the brain, kidney, and liver may trigger necroptosis and thus cell death.

## AGING OF THE HUMAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS

The age-related changes just described at the cellular and molecular levels can also manifest themselves as deterioration of physiological systems. Although here we discuss typical age-related changes in physiological systems, the extent of change among individuals may range from barely perceptible to very marked. Indeed, a subset of individuals shows minimal physiological deterioration-these people have undergone "successful" aging. Many individuals show marked deterioration with age in all physiological systems (Box 62-1), whereas other individuals exhibit little or no deterioration in one or more systems. Although the nature of the aging process is similar in the two sexes-except, of course, for the reproductive system-important quantitative differences exist. Because of the great reserve capacity or

## BOX 62-1 Frailty

Frailty is a geriatric syndrome prevalent at advanced ages. It has been estimated that $7 \%$ of people over age 65 years and $20 \%$ of those over age 80 years are frail. According to the Fried frailty criteria, frailty exists when at least three of the following characteristics are present*:

- Unintentional weight loss ( 4 kg in the past year)
- Self-reported exhaustion
- Weakness (reduced grip strength)
- Slow walking speed
- Low physical activity

Individuals defined as frail using these criteria are at increased risk of falls, worsening disability, hospitalization, and death. Frailty is distinct from age-associated diseases and is not a synonym for disability-the inability to perform one or more of the so-called activities of daily living. In a cohort identified as frail, $\sim 27 \%$ of the individuals had neither comorbidity nor disability. However, comorbidity and disability are risk factors for becoming frail, and disability is an adverse outcome of frailty.

Although it had long been believed that long-term involuntary weight loss is due to reduced food intake, newer insights indicate that this is not the case. For example, attempting to increase the patient's food intake is usually not effective. Moreover, rats of advanced ages undergo a prolonged terminal weight loss, even though many of the rats exhibited an increase and not a decrease in food intake during the weight loss (a phenomenon not related to a particular pathological process). The likelihood and extent of frailty rises with increasing steepness as the number of abnormal physiological processes increases.

redundancy of some physiological systems, the effect of aging on a physiological process is often not apparent until either the individual faces an unusual challenge or function has fallen below some critical level.

## Aging people lose height and lean body mass but gain and redistribute fat

Women reach peak height by age 16 to 17 years and men by 18 to 19 years. After reaching these peaks, height starts to decline, primarily due to compression of the cartilaginous disks between the vertebrae and loss of vertebral bone. This decline begins at $\sim 20$ years of age in women and at 25 years in men. By the age of 70 years, height has fallen $2.5 \%$ to $5 \%$ from the peak level.

In most Americans, body mass increases until middle age in both sexes and begins to decrease after age 70. Fat-free mass is defined as body mass minus adipose-tissue fat mass, and lean body mass is defined as fat-free mass minus both bone mass and non-adipose-tissue fat mass. Both fatfree mass and lean body mass progressively decrease over most of adult life in both sexes. Although a sedentary lifestyle may contribute to this loss, lifelong athletes also show a progressive age-associated loss in fat-free mass and lean body mass.

Adipose-tissue fat mass increases with adult age, with the extent differing markedly among individuals. Although a sedentary lifestyle may be a factor, even physically fit individuals who do not exhibit an age-associated increase in body mass show a small but progressive increase in adiposetissue fat mass (in parallel with the aforementioned decrease in fat-free body mass). In addition, the distribution of body fat changes with increasing age, with an accumulation of fat around abdominal viscera and in abdominal subcutaneous tissue. At the same time, a decrease in fat occurs in the extremities and the face; facial fat loss can give rise to a gaunt look. Visceral adipose tissue is an important source of cytokines (often referred to as adipokines) that promote inflammation, which in turn may play a role in the occurrence and progression of senescence.

## Aging thins the skin and causes the musculoskeletal system to become weak, brittle, and stiff

Skin As is clearly evident from cosmetic advertisements, most of us use the skin as an indicator of aging. Intrinsic aging (see p. 1237) is manifest in skin areas protected from the sun, such as the buttocks. The additional damage caused by long-term exposure to the sun's ultraviolet radiation is called photoaging.

In intrinsic aging, the thickness of the epidermis (see pp. 383-384) decreases slightly, with no change in the outermost epidermal layer, the stratum corneum. The rate of generation of keratinocytes, which end their lives as the stratum corneum, slows with age, which increases the dwell time of stratum-corneum components. The decreasing number of melanocytes reduces photoprotection, and the decreasing number of Langerhans cells reduces immune surveillance.

Intrinsic aging of the dermis affects mainly the extracellular matrix. The amount of elastin and collagen decreases, and their structures change. Glycosaminoglycan composition
also changes. (T) N62-15 As a result, the dermis thins by $\sim 20 \%$ and becomes stiffer, less malleable, and thus more vulnerable to injury.

Photoaging increases the extent of most intrinsic age changes in both the epidermis and dermis, and it has additional effects. For example, photoaging causes coarse wrinkles, which occur minimally or not at all because of intrinsic aging.

Aging also reduces the number and function of sweat glands as well as the production of sebum by sebaceous glands. The number of active melanocytes in hair follicles decreases, resulting in graying of hair. Nail growth also slows with increasing age.

Skeletal Muscle A steady loss in skeletal muscle masssarcopenia-occurs with aging, particularly beyond 50 years, and it primarily reflects a loss of number and, to a lesser extent, size of muscle fibers. The sarcopenia is due in part to inactivity, but also to a progressive loss of the motor neurons innervating type II motor units (see pp. 228-229 and 1205-1206), which are recruited less frequently. With loss of their motor nerve, affected muscle fibers either atrophy and die or become innervated by a sprout that emerges from a healthy axon nearby. This process of reinnervation ultimately results in larger motor units and thus a decrement in fine motor control. The reduction in muscle strength and power is often a major cause of disability in the elderly. However, strength training in elderly persons can increase the size of the fibers and can thereby increase muscle mass.

Bone Remodeling of bone (see pp. 1057-1058) occurs throughout adult life; it involves the coordinated activity of osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which form bone. During early adulthood, bone resorption and formation are in balance. However, starting late in the third decade of life, resorption exceeds formation, which leads to a slow progressive loss in bone mass. This loss is likely due to the action on osteoblasts of ROS, decreased insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and increased parathyroid hormone. In women, bone loss accelerates for 5 to 10 years following menopause because of decreased levels of estrogen and increased levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). After this postmenopausal period, the rate of bone loss with increasing age in women returns to that of men. In addition to the factors noted for bone loss in 20- and 30-year-olds, low levels of estrogen and testosterone are also involved at advanced ages. Bone loss can progress to osteoporosis (see Box 52-3), defined by the World Health Organization as a bone mineral density $\geq 2.5 \mathrm{SD}$ below the mean values for young adults. Osteoporosis, a major problem in geriatric medicine, carries a heightened risk of bone fractures.

Synovial Joints The synovial joint permits free movement of the bones linked by the joint. With increasing adult age, joint flexibility falls, due mainly to the aging of articular cartilage. This cartilage thins and exhibits altered mechanical features, including decreased tensile stiffness, fatigue resistance, and strength. These changes are partly due to decreases in water content. Aging impairs the function of chondrocytes, increases the cross-linking of collagen, and causes a loss of proteoglycans. The age-related changes in

As indicated in the text, glycosaminoglycan composition changes with aging. However, the story is complex. The levels of hyaluronic acid and the proteoglycan versican-which contains chondroitin sulfate (CS) and dermatan sulfate (DS)-are decreased. On the other hand, the level of the proteoglycan decorin-which also contains CS and DS-is increased.

joint cartilage undoubtedly play a major role in the development of osteoarthritis.

## The healthy elderly experience deficits in sensory transduction and speed of central processing

It is a common misconception that advancing age causes marked deterioration in the nervous system. However, in the absence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, impairment of the nervous system with age is much less severe than often believed.

Sensory Functions Most sensory systems exhibit some deterioration with age. Sensitivity to touch decreases, as do the abilities to sense vibration and to distinguish two spatially distinct points of contact. Proprioception, including the vestibular system of the inner ear, also deteriorates somewhat. As discussed on page 1194, the loss of thermoregulatory ability, a serious problem for many elderly, occurs in part because of an impaired ability to sense heat and cold.

Hearing loss, particularly of high-frequency sound, is an almost invariable consequence of advancing age. This impairment is usually caused by loss of hair cells of the organ of Corti (see pp. 377-378), but it can also stem from loss of nerve cells of the auditory nerve or from a reduced blood supply to the cochlea. A deficit in central processing can make it difficult for some elderly to distinguish spoken words from background noise.

Vision also deteriorates with increasing age. A progressive loss in the power of accommodation-presbyopiaoccurs during adult life (see p. 362). Almost all elderly have a reduced number of retinal cones, lessened ability to alter pupil size in response to light intensity, and decreased ability of retinal rods to adapt to low intensity light (see pp. 368369). In addition, age-associated diseases-cataracts, glaucoma, and macular degeneration-can markedly decrease vision in many of the elderly.

The ability to detect and discriminate among sweet, sour, salty, and bitter taste qualities (see p. 356) deteriorates somewhat at advanced ages, along with a marked reduction in olfaction (see pp. 354-356). Because "taste" involves both gustation and olfaction, many elderly live in a world of "pastel" food flavors.

Motor Functions A major effect of aging is the slowing of reaction time: the time elapsed between the occurrence of a stimulus and the motor response to it. This delay is observable in simple responses and becomes more pronounced as the complexity of the response increases (e.g., the need to make a choice among responses). Thus, a hallmark of nervous system aging is the slowing of central processing. One result is that the elderly tend to execute movements more slowly than the young.

The ability to maintain posture and balance deteriorates with increasing age. Slowing of central processing is a factor, but decreased muscle strength and deterioration of vision and proprioception also play important roles. Not surprisingly, the elderly have a high incidence of falls. Even when capable of walking at normal speeds, the healthy elderly tend to walk more slowly than the young and take shorter and more frequent steps. This walking pattern is less taxing for a
person with knee and ankle joints that are less flexible, aids in maintaining balance, and enables a deteriorating sensory system to monitor hazards more effectively.

Cognitive Functions Although lay people generally believe that cognitive functions (e.g., intelligence, memory, learning) decline with advancing age, the cognitive decline is not marked in the absence of dementia. The decline that does occur in the healthy elderly may reflect the slowing of central processing. The capacity to use knowledge is not decreased in the healthy aged, but the ability to solve novel problems does decline. Certain types of memory deteriorate with advancing age, such as remembering where the car keys were left, but other types are not lost, such as retrieving conceptual information. Older people are capable of learning, but they do so less quickly than younger people.

## Aging causes decreased arterial compliance and increased ventilation-perfusion mismatching

Atherosclerosis can cause marked deterioration of cardiovascular function in the elderly, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (see p. 619) can do the same for pulmonary function. However, in the absence of such diseases, ageassociated changes in these physiological systems are modest.

Cardiovascular Function As discussed on pages 458-459, aging decreases the distensibility of arteries. The decreased compliance elevates systolic pressure, slightly decreases diastolic pressure, and thus widens pulse pressure. Afterload (see p. 526), the resistance to ejection of blood from the left ventricle, increases with advancing age, primarily because of reduced arterial compliance. The increased afterload causes thickening of the left ventricular wall, which involves an increase in size but not number of myocytes.

Preload, the end-diastolic volume of blood in the left ventricle (see p. 526), does not change with age in subjects at rest. Although early diastolic filling falls, a compensatory increase in left atrial contraction enhances late-diastolic filling.

Many elderly experience postural hypotension (see p. 576) because of age-associated blunting of the arterial baroreceptor reflex.

Pulmonary Function The strength and endurance of the respiratory muscles decrease with age, primarily because of atrophy of type IIa muscle fibers. Lung volumes-both static volumes and forced expiratory volumes (e.g., $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$; see p. 602) gradually decrease with age. In addition, small airways have an increased tendency to collapse (atelectasis) because of degeneration of the collagen and elastin support structure. The result is impaired ventilation of dependent lung regions, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and reduced resting arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. In spite of these functional deteriorations, healthy elderly people do not experience a failure of either ventilation or gas exchange. However, when challenged by homeostatic disturbances-such as those occurring during ill health—old people may have compromised pulmonary function.

Exercise Maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake ( $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \max }}$; see pp. 1213-1214) declines progressively with aging in physically trained

individuals and even more so in untrained individuals of the same chronological age. Decreasing muscle mass as well as reduced cardiovascular and pulmonary function probably all contribute to the decline in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$, and the relative importance of each factor varies among individuals.

The cardiovascular system responds to exercise differently in the elderly than in the young. For a given increase in cardiac output, heart rate rises less and stroke volume rises more in the elderly. Because the aging heart is less responsive to adrenergic stimulation, the increase in stroke volume is due primarily to the Frank-Starling mechanism (see pp. 524-526). Thus, during exercise, the left ventricular enddiastolic and end-systolic volumes increase, and maximal left ventricular ejection fraction falls.

The elderly exhibit a decrease in the pulmonary diffusing capacity $\left(D_{L}\right)$-due in part to decreased alveolar capillary volume-and an increase in the ventilation-perfusion mismatch. These alterations in pulmonary function have been implicated in the decrease in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2 \text { max }}}$.

The ability of the body to respond to physical conditioning decreases with aging. Nevertheless, skeletal muscle and the cardiovascular system remain responsive to exercise into the 10th decade of life.

## Glomerular filtration rate falls with age in many but not all people

On average, renal blood flow decreases progressively with increasing age. Basal levels of renin and angiotensin II are lower in older adults. Cross-sectional studies show that glomerular filtration rate (GFR) starts to decline at 30 years of age and thereafter falls linearly with age. However, analysis of longitudinal data from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging reveals that one third of the participants exhibited the GFR decline predicted from cross-sectional analysis, one third had a steeper decline, and one third had no decline at all. Thus, an age-associated decline in GFR is not inevitable.

Cross-sectional studies indicate that renal-tubule transport functions decrease with age. The kidneys do not respond as effectively to changes in sodium load, do not dilute or concentrate urine as effectively, and also have a somewhat impaired ability to excrete potassium, phosphate, and acid.

Many elderly men and women experience bladder symptoms such as urgency, nocturia, and frequency. The capacity and compliance of the urinary bladder decrease with advancing age, and the number of uninhibited or inappropriate detrusor contractions increases. These changes make it more difficult to postpone voiding, a symptom known as urgency. A decrease in detrusor activity can contribute to a decreased rate of bladder emptying as well as an increase in residual bladder volume after voiding-poor emptying performance, which contributes to urinary frequency. (5) N62-16 Sensory dysfunction also can underlie the above pathologic conditions.

## Aging has only minor effects on gastrointestinal function

Although gastrointestinal (GI) problems are the second most common reason for hospital admission of elderly patients,
the GI system functions in the healthy elderly about as well as in the young. Although a loss of ability to secrete gastric acid was previously thought to be a part of aging, it is now clear that this loss is limited to those infected with Helicobacter pylori (see Box 42-3). The loss of skeletal muscle at both ends of the GI tract can lead to minor age-related decreases in function (i.e., chewing, swallowing, fecal continence). (5) N62-17 Minor decreases occur in secretion by exocrine glands. Liver mass and hepatic blood flow, as well as the clearance of certain drugs, decrease significantly. Moreover, the elderly experience a delay in hepatic regeneration following damage.

## Aging causes modest declines in most endocrine functions

Total energy expenditure decreases with age, primarily due to decreases in physical activity. An age-associated decrease in the resting metabolic rate (RMR; see p. 1170) reflects a decrease in fat-free mass (see p. 1243); that is, the RMR per kilogram of fat-free mass does not decrease.

Insulin The impaired glucose tolerance (see Fig. 51-3) that usually occurs with aging is due primarily to increased insulin resistance, which in turn results mainly from increased adiposity and decreased physical activity. However, aging per se does play a small role. In addition, the elderly exhibit an age-associated decrease in insulin secretion that does not appear to be due to the lifestyle factors underlying insulin resistance.

Growth Hormone and IGF-1 Aging diminishes the concentrations of growth hormone (GH) generated by the pulsatile action of somatotrophs. A consequence is greatly reduced plasma IGF-1 concentrations (see p. 997). However, it is not clear what roles, if any, these alterations play in age-associated physiological deterioration.

Adrenal Steroids The basal, circadian, and stimulated secretion of cortisol exhibits little age-related change. Aldosterone secretion is also well preserved. In contrast, the plasma concentration of the adrenal cortical hormone dehydroepiandrosterone (see p. 1097) decreases markedly with increasing age.

Thyroid Hormones Thyroid function appears to be unaffected by age into the ninth decade of life. However, in centenarians plasma levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may decrease due to decreased secretion, and free triiodothyronine levels may fall due to impaired $5^{\prime} / 3^{\prime}$-deiodinase (see p. 1010).

Parathyroid Hormone Plasma parathyroid hormone levels increase with advancing age due to an increase in the rate of secretion by the parathyroid glands.

Gonadal Hormones Reproductive ability in women abruptly ceases at $\sim 50$ years of age with the occurrence of the menopause (see pp. 1127-1128). Men do not undergo an abrupt change in reproductive function during middle age. However, a progressive decrease in male reproductive

## N62-16 Effect of Aging on Bladder Function

A decrease in the rate of urine flow with age occurs in both sexes. In men, benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH) is the major factor causing an increase in residual bladder volume after voiding. However, a small increase with age often occurs in women as well.

## N62-17 Effect of Aging on the GI Tract

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

Aging is associated with a loss in the mass of the skeletal muscles at both ends of the GI tract. At the oral end, muscles involved in mastication and the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing tend to decrease in mass. However, the loss usually is not sufficient to cause morbidity.

The frequency of fecal incontinence increases with age. The problem is underreported because it is often hidden, even from physicians. Weakness of the external anal sphincter is often an important contributory factor.

and related functions does occur, often referred to as the andropause (see Box 54-1).

## AGING SLOWLY

Slowing the aging process, and thereby extending life, has been a human goal throughout recorded history and probably in preliterate times as well. The marked increase in human life expectancy in the 20th century could be viewed as achieving this goal. However, much of that increase results from prevention of premature deaths related to infections and other environmental hazards. It remains to be established how much, if any, of the increase relates to slowing the aging process. Indeed, over the centuries, the life span of the oldest of the old in human populations has changed little, although the fraction of the population reaching these advanced ages has increased significantly. In contrast, both environmental and genetic manipulations can markedly extend the maximal life span of a population in several other species.

## Caloric restriction slows aging and extends life in several species, including some mammals

Restricting the food intake of rats, starting soon after weaning, increases both mean and maximum life span of both genders of several strains of rats-as first reported by Clive McCay in 1935. (5) N62-18 The marked increase in rat longevity is graphically illustrated by the survival curves in Figure 62-7. Manipulation of the components (protein, fat, carbohydrate, minerals, and vitamins) of a purified rat diet revealed that the life-extending action of food restriction in rats results from caloric restriction rather from than a specific dietary component.

Reducing food intake also extends the life of mice, (5) N62-19 hamsters, dogs, fish, several invertebrate animal

Note that both the median length of life and the maximum length of life are markedly greater in the restricted population.

species, and yeast. Studies of rhesus monkeys, still in progress, indicate that food restriction may also extend the life of nonhuman primates.

Does food restriction extend life by slowing aging processes? This is a difficult question to answer because of the lack of consensus on how to measure the aging of individuals or populations. However, for two reasons, most biogerontologists believe that food restriction does retard aging processes. First, compared to rodents of the same age fed ad libitum, those on life-extending food-restriction regimens maintain physiological processes more like those of young animals. Second, life-extending food restriction delays the onset or progression of most age-associated diseases, including neoplastic, degenerative, and immune diseases.

During the past 70 years, many hypotheses have been proposed regarding the biological mechanisms underlying the life-prolonging action of food restriction, but none is firmly established. McCay proposed that caloric restriction extends life by retarding growth. However, later observations showed that food restriction, even when initiated in young adult rats or middle-age mice, significantly extends life. Another early hypothesis was that food restriction extends life by markedly reducing adipose fat mass. However, it is possible to dissociate the effects of food restriction on longevity from the effects on fat mass in rats and mice.

Currently, the most popular view is that food restriction extends life by decreasing oxidative stress (see pp. 12381239). Indeed, life-extending food restriction does decrease the accumulation of age-associated oxidative damage. It also causes a sustained reduction in plasma glucose levels, which could reduce glycation and glycoxidation (see p. 1239), as well as a marked and sustained reduction in plasma levels of insulin and IGF-1. Genetic studies strongly indicate that decreasing insulin-like signaling (see pp. 996 and 10411042) extends life. Thus, the decrease in the levels of insulin and IGF-1 may well play an important role in food restriction-induced life extension.

Inhibiting the mTOR pathway (see Fig. 51-6) by administering rapamycin extends the life of 600-day-old mice. (6) N62-20 This mTOR pathway senses nutrient status and is involved in regulating eukaryotic growth and cell division. Thus, it is possible that inhibiting the TOR pathway has a role in caloric restriction-induced life extension.

Another theory of the antiaging action of caloric restriction is hormesis, defined as the beneficial effects resulting from cellular responses to mild repeated stress, which would stimulate maintenance and repair processes and thereby retard aging. Food restriction at the level that extends life is a mild stress repeated daily. Moreover, food-restricted rodents have an increased ability to cope with acute, intense damaging agents, such as surgery, toxic chemicals, and high environmental temperatures.

## Genetic alterations can extend life in several species

Caloric restriction is an example of environmental factors that determine longevity. It is also clear that genetics has a major role. For example, the large differences in life span among species (from $<100$ days in Drosophila melanogaster to $<5$ years in mice to $>100$ years in humans) are primarily, if not exclusively, due to genetic differences. Moreover,

# N62-20 TOR Kinases and the Aging Process 

## Contributed by Edward Masoro

To survive, organisms must be able to respond to variable nutrient availability by transitioning between anabolic and catabolic status. The mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin) protein kinase systems play a major role in enabling organisms to do so. Rapamycin-which is produced by a soil bacterium and has antifungal, anticancer, and immunosuppressive actions-inhibits mTOR protein kinases.

In mammals, mTOR is found in two multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. The protein components of mTORC1 are mTOR, Raptor (scaffold protein), Pras 40 (mTORC1 inhibitor), Deptor (mTOR inhibitor), mLST8 (function unknown), and ttl1 and tel2 (stability and assembly proteins). The components of mTORC2 are mTOR, Rictor (scaffold protein), mSn1 (scaffold protein), Protor $1 / 2$ (assists in activation of SGK1), Deptor, mLST8, ttl1, and tel2.

The activity of mTORC1 is promoted by amino acids, energy level, growth factors, and oxygen and is inhibited by stress. In turn, mTORC1 promotes growth, cell-cycle progression, macromolecular biosynthesis, and metabolism, and inhibits autophagy.

The activity of mTORC2 is promoted by growth factors. In turn, mTORC2 promotes metabolism, cytoskeletal organization, and cell survival.

These actions of the TOR complexes involve a spectrum of signaling pathways and are the subject of continuing research.

It was long held that rapamycin inhibits only the activity of TORC1. However, it is now clear that the sustained use of rapamycin also inhibits TORC2, which complicates the interpretation of studies based on the actions of this inhibitor.

That TOR may play a role in aging was first suggested in 2003 when Vellai and colleagues reported that a deficiency of TOR kinases more than doubles the life span of C. elegans. A year later, Kapahi and coworkers reported that inhibiting TOR kinases extends the life span of Drosophila. And in 2005, Kaeberlein and colleagues reported that deletion of TORC1 increases the replicative life span of yeast. In 2009, Harrison and colleagues reported
that rapamycin fed to genetically heterogeneous mice starting late in life ( 600 days of age) extended the life span by $14 \%$ in females and $9 \%$ in males.

In a recently published study, Lamming and coworkers hypothesized that rapamycin extends the life span of females more than that of males because it inhibits both TORC1 and TORC2. Indeed, when they decreased or eliminated the Rictor component of TORC2 in mice by any of three different procedures, they found that the life span was significantly decreased in male mice but was not affected in female mice.

Although much more remains to be learned about the role of TOR kinases in aging, it is clear that, via their signaling networks, they play important roles in the aging process. Studies aimed at defining these networks in relation to aging almost certainly will be a major focus of future biogerontological research.

selective breeding within a species can produce populations that differ significantly in longevity.

Longevity probably depends on multiple genes. Thus, it was a surprise when Friedman and Johnson reported in 1988 that mutation of the age-1 gene of the nematode worm, Caenorhabditis elegans, results in a marked increase in longevity. The age-1 gene encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (see p. 1042), which is a component of the insulin-like signaling pathway. Note that C. elegans, like other invertebrates, does not have separate signaling pathways for insulin (see pp. 1041-1042) and IGF-1 (see p. 996), as do mammals. The mutation of age-1 studied by Friedman and Johnson causes some loss of function-that is, it is a weak mutation. Among other single-gene manipulations found to extend the life of C. elegans, D. melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and mice, many but not all involve a partial loss of function of the insulin-like signaling pathway.

Ames dwarf mice have a recessive point mutation in the Prop-1 gene, which results in the inability of the pituitary to produce $\mathrm{GH}, \mathrm{TSH}$, and prolactin. These mice have low levels of thyroid hormone, IGF-1, and insulin. Significantly, these dwarf mice have an increased life span compared with littermates not homozygous for this mutation.

Further support for a role of reduced insulin-like signaling in life extension comes from studies of mice with a knockout of the $G H R / B P$ gene, which encodes the GH receptor and its proteolytic cleavage product, GH-binding protein. This knockout mouse exhibits growth retardation, high plasma GH levels, low plasma IGF-1 levels, and significant life extension. Reducing the expression of the insulin receptor by $85 \%$ to $90 \%$ in the adipose tissue of mice resulted in significant life extension. Finally, overexpression of the KLOTHO gene (1) N36-12 in mice increases the plasma level of Klotho protein, which suppresses insulin and IGF-1 signaling and extends the life of mice.

In yeast, overexpression of the sir2 gene increases the level of a sirtuin protein called Sir2 and extends the replicative life of S. cerevisiae. Sir2 is a deacetylase that stabilizes ribosomal DNA. Sir2 may play a role in other species. Indeed, stimulating Sir2 orthologs extends the life span of C. elegans, $D$. melanogaster, and human cell lines. However, it is not yet
clear whether sirtuin proteins play an important role in the life-prolonging action of caloric restriction.

## Proposed interventions to slow aging and extend human life are controversial

We have already seen that life-extending dietary manipulations, pharmacological interventions, and genetic alterations may have in common that they modify signaling pathways. Because these signaling pathways probably interact extensively, it is attractive to speculate that they are components of a longevity-signaling network.

The practice of antiaging medicine is becoming popular and plays an important role in preventing the occurrence and progression of certain age-associated diseases. For example, exercise and diet can reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. However, some practitioners of antiaging medicine, as well as suppliers of pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals, claim to have "magic bullets" that slow or even reverse aging. These purported magic bullets include antioxidants (e.g., vitamins E and C), amino acids (e.g., methionine), drugs (e.g., deprenyl), and hormones (e.g., melatonin, dehydroepiandrosterone, GH, estrogen, and testosterone). No credible evidence indicates that any of these agents will reverse or even slow human aging. Aside from the question of efficacy is the possibility of long-term adverse effects of these supposed magic bullets. Combined estrogen and progestin therapy is a case in point. Although hailed for relieving the symptoms of menopause, this hormone replacement therapy was long in use before a well-designed study uncovered its harmful effects on the cardiovascular system. In light of the animal studies strongly indicating that insulin-like signaling promotes aging, the current use of recombinant GH is of concern. Although GH increases lean body mass in the elderly, well-designed studies are needed before GH is used as an antiaging agent.
