# ORGANIZATION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM 

Walter F. Boron

## COMPARATIVE PHYSIOLOGY OF RESPIRATION

## External respiration is the exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the atmosphere and the mitochondria

For millennia, people have regarded breathing as being synonymous with life. Life begins and ends with breathing. The Bible states that God "breathed into [Adam's] nostrils the breath of life" and then later used part of Adam's ventilatory apparatus-a rib-to give life to Eve.

In the fourth and fifth centuries BC, writings attributed to Hippocrates suggested that the primary purpose of breathing is to cool the heart. It was not until the 18th century that the true role of breathing began to emerge as several investigators studied the chemistry of gases. Chemists had recognized similarities between combustion and breathing but thought that both involved the release of a "fire-essence" called phlogiston. According to their theory, neither combustion nor life could be supported once air became saturated with phlogiston.

In the 1750s, Joseph Black (1) N26-1 found that heating calcium carbonate produces a gas he called "fixed air," now known to be carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$. He also found that animal respiration produces this gas. Shortly thereafter, Henry Cavendish (1) N26-2 found that fermentation and putrefaction also produce fixed air. The early 1770s saw the codiscovery of oxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$ by Carl Scheele (1) N26-3 (who called it "fire air") and Joseph Priestley (1) N26-4 (who called it "dephlogistonated air"). In 1785, Henry Cavendish (1) N26-2 found that dephlogistonated air represents $\sim 20 \%$ of atmospheric air. Priestley found that combustion, putrefaction, and breathing all consume dephlogistonated air, and all reduce the volume of room air by $\sim 20 \%$. Conversely, he found that green plants produce dephlogistonated air, which he quantitated by reacting it with nitric oxide (a colorless gas) to produce nitrogen dioxide (a red gas).

In the mid-1770s, Priestley presented his findings to Antoine Lavoisier (1) N26-5-often regarded as the father of modern chemistry. Lavoisier quickly put Priestley's empirical observations into a theoretical framework that he used to demolish the phlogiston theory, which Priestley held to his death. Lavoisier recognized that dephlogistonated air, which he named "oxygen," represents the $\sim 20 \%$ of room air consumed by combustion in Priestley's experiments, leaving
behind "nonvital" air, or nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$. Furthermore, he proposed that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is consumed because it reacts with one substance to produce another. The mathematician JosephLouis Lagrange (1) N26-6 suggested that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production occur not in the lungs but in isolated tissues, as Lazzaro Spallanzani later rigorously demonstrated in the late 18th century. (1) N26-7

Thus, by the end of the 18th century, chemists and physiologists appreciated that combustion, putrefaction, and respiration all involve chemical reactions that consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and produce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Subsequent advances in the chemistry of gases by Boyle, Henry, Avogadro, and others laid the theoretical foundation for the physiology of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, respiration was a unifying theme in the early histories of physiology, chemistry, and biochemistry.

Later work showed that mitochondrial respiration (i.e., the oxidation of carbon-containing compounds to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) is responsible for the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production observed by Spallanzani. This aspect of respiration is often called internal respiration or oxidative phosphorylation (see p. 1185).

In the chapters on respiratory physiology, we focus on external respiration, the dual processes of (1) transporting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the atmosphere to the mitochondria and (2) transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the mitochondria to the atmosphere. We will also see that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport is intimately related to acidbase homeostasis.

## Diffusion is the major mechanism of external respiration for small aquatic organisms

The most fundamental mechanism of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport is diffusion (see p. 108). Random movements of molecules such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, whether in a gaseous phase or dissolved in water, result in a net movement of the substance from regions of high concentration to regions of low concentration (Fig. 26-1A, inset). No expenditure of energy is involved. The driving force for diffusion is the concentration gradient.

Imagine a unicellular organism suspended in a beaker of pond water at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The water is in equilibrium with an atmosphere that has the usual composition of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Table 26-1). The partial pressures of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ and of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ in the $d r y$ air are slightly higher than their corresponding values in the wet air immediately above the surface of

## N26-1 Joseph Black (1728-1799)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Joseph Black, a Scottish physician and chemist, made three landmark discoveries. He discovered the concepts of latent heat and specific heat. Most important for respiratory physiology, he also discovered carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, which he called "fixed air." In the critical experiments, Black found that either heating or adding acid to calcium carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}\right)$ produced fixed air. This work revolutionized chemistry by showing that other gases exist besides ordinary "air" and that a chemical reaction can involve a gas.

Black also demonstrated the reverse: bubbling fixed air through a solution containing calcium hydroxide caused the precipitation of $\mathrm{CaCO}_{3}$. Black used this assay to demonstrate that animal respiration produces fixed air.

## N26-3 Carl Wilhelm Scheele (1742-1786)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Carl Scheele was a Swedish pharmacist and chemist who made several important discoveries in the early history of chemistry. Unfortunately, many of his key discoveries were published after those of his competitors. He died at an early age, apparently from the toxic effects of the chemicals that he studied.

Scheele obtained what he called "fire air" in 1771, first from manganese dioxide $\left(\mathrm{MnO}_{2}\right)$ and then from HgO and other oxygen-containing compounds. Priestley obtained "dephlogistonated air" from HgO in 1774.

## N26-2 Henry Cavendish (1731-1810)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Henry Cavendish is known for recognizing that hydrogen gas $\left(\mathbf{H}_{\mathrm{p}}\right.$, or as he called it, "inflammable air") is made up of an element. Along with James Watt and Antoine Lavoisier, Cavendish found that inflammable air reacts with oxygen ("dephlogistonated air") to produce water (Lavoisier did similar work). Cavendish interpreted these data in terms of phlogiston; it was Lavoisier who made the modern interpretation and gave hydrogen its name. Cavendish-along with Joseph Priestly, N26-4 Joseph Black, N26-1 and others-is sometimes regarded as a pneumatic chemist.

Cavendish was not only brilliant but also extraordinarily shy. He made many discoveries that were never published but nevertheless predated the discoveries credited to others (Charles's and Dalton's laws dealing with gases and Ohm's and Coulomb's laws dealing with electricity).

## N26-4 Joseph Priestley (1733-1804)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Joseph Priestley was a theologian, philosopher, and chemist who-along with Carl Wilhelm Scheele-is generally credited with the discovery of oxygen $\left(\mathbf{O}_{2}\right)$, which he called "dephlogistonated air." In his key experiment, which dates from 1774, Priestley focused the sun's rays on mercuric oxide ( HgO ), producing dephlogistonated air. Moreover, Priestley showed that dephlogistonated air was 5 - to 6 -fold more effective at supporting breathing or combustion than "common atmospherical air."

Carl Wilhelm Scheele (N26-3 discovered a gas that he called "fire air" $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, probably in 1771 (i.e., 3 years before Priestley). However, Scheele's work was not published until 1777. Scheele obtained fire air first from manganese dioxide $\left(\mathrm{MnO}_{2}\right)$ and then from HgO and other oxygen-containing compounds.

Priestley was a staunch supporter of the phlogiston theory; it was Antoine Lavoisier (N26-5 who put the observations of Priestley on sound theoretical grounds.

Priestley's political views (e.g., supporting the American and French Revolutions) and religious views (e.g., supporting religious dissent and contributing to the founding of the Unitarian Church) forced him to flee to America, although not before his home was burned by rioters. He spent the last 10 years of his life in rural Pennsylvania, never having putting aside the phlogiston theory.

## N26-5 Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier—known simply as Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution-was a French nobleman who is sometimes regarded as the father of modern chemistry. He did not make any discoveries of chemicals to which others could not also lay claim (e.g., hydrogen gas in the case of Cavendish ( $\mathbf{N 2 6 - 2}$ ), nor develop any highly novel experimental apparatus. Rather, his contributions were mainly theoretical, supported by quantitative experiments that extended the work of others (e.g., Black, Scheele, Priestley, Cavendish) and put their work in a sound theoretical framework.

In his 1789 treatise on chemistry—regarded by some as the first modern textbook of chemistry-Lavoisier presented a unifying theory that elucidated the concept of a chemical element and how these can form chemical compounds. He pioneered the concepts of stoichiometry and the conservation of mass, and argued strongly against the phlogiston theory. As is sometimes the case in science, a number of the major proponents of the phlogiston theory were unmoved; however, the next generation of chemists found Lavoisier's arguments convincing and the phlogiston theory was abandoned.

The chemistry of the respiratory gases played a central role in Lavoisier's thinking. He recognized that both combustion and breathing involve the consumption of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and production of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Lavoisier defended Lagrange and other foreign-born scientists whose rights were being abridged by the government. During the Reign of Terror, Lavoisier was summarily tried, convicted, and executed on May 8, 1794. For more information about Antoine Lavoisier, visit the following websites:

## N26-6 Joseph-Louis Lagrange (1736-1813)

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia-an astronomer and one of the greatest mathematicians of his time-was born in Turin, moved to Berlin in 1766, and then moved to Paris in 1786. He survived the French Revolution and died in France.

Lagrange's contribution to biology-specifically to respiratory physiology-is a conclusion that he based entirely on theory: he concluded that respiration (i.e., combustion) within the body could not take place entirely within the lungs because this would be inconsistent with the even distribution of heat throughout the body.

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Lazzaro Spallanzani was an ordained Catholic priest and scientist who made contributions in a wide range of biological disciplines, including reproduction, regeneration (e.g., of amphibian limbs), and respiration. He argued strongly against the theory of spontaneous generation. His work on respiration, published posthumously, demonstrated that several tissues consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and evolve $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

the water (Box 26-1). It is these partial pressures in wet air that determine the concentrations of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}\right)$ and dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}\right)$ in the water (Box 26-2). Thus, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the wet air-as well as the water beneath it-will be $\sim 149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (or torr), and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ will be an almost negligible 0.2 mm Hg . These numbers describe the composition of the bulk phase of the pond water (see Fig. 26-1A, left side), at some distance from the organism. However, because
the mitochondria within the organism continuously consume $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and produce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at the surface of the mitochondria will be lower than the bulk-phase $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, whereas the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ at the mitochondrial surface will be higher than the bulkphase $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Fig. 26-1A, right side). These differences in partial pressure cause $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to diffuse from the bulk pond water toward the mitochondria and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to diffuse in the opposite direction.

## BOX 26-1 Wet Gases: Partial Pressures of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in Solutions That Are Equilibrated with Wet Air (1) N26-8

Imagine that a beaker of water is equilibrated with a normal atmosphere and that both water and atmosphere have a temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. For dry air (i.e., air containing no water vapor), $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ makes up $\sim 21 \%$ of the total gas by volume (see Table 26-1). Thus, if the ambient pressure-or barometric pressure ( $\mathbf{P b}$ )—is 760 mm Hg , the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ is $21 \%$ of 760 mm Hg , or 159 mm Hg (Fig. 26-2). However, if the air-water interface is reasonably stationary, water vapor will saturate the air immediately adjacent to the liquid. What is the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in this wet air? At $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the partial pressure of water $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right)$ is 47 mm Hg . Of the total pressure of the wet air, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ makes up 47 mm Hg , and the components of the dry air make up the remaining $760 \sim 47$, or 713 mm Hg . Thus, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in this wet air is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} & =\frac{\overline{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{S}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right)}{\left.=\left(21 \%\right) \cdot\left(760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}-47 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)\right.} \\
& =149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
\end{aligned}
$$

The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ composition of dry air is $\sim 0.03 \%$ (see Table 26-1). Thus, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in wet air is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} & =\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{S}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}\right) \\
& =(0.03 \%) \cdot(760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}-47 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \\
& =0.21 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
\end{aligned}
$$

These examples are realistic for respiratory physiology. As we inhale relatively cool and dry air, the nose and other upper respiratory passages rapidly warm and moisturize the passing air so that it assumes the composition of wet air given in Table 26-1.
![bo04465312c5](bo04465312c5.jpg)

Figure 26-2 Wet versus dry gases. Note that the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressure is less in wet than in dry air.

The diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ follows a gradient of decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see Fig. 26-1A). The region over which $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls gradually from the bulk pond water toward the outer surface of the plasma membrane is the extracellular unstirred layer, so named because no convective mixing occurs in this zone. A similar gradual decline in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ drives $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion through the intracellular unstirred layer, from the inner surface of the plasma membrane to the mitochondria. The abrupt fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ across the plasma membrane reflects some resistance to gas flow. The profile for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is similar, although with the opposite orientation.

The rate at which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ moves across the surface of the organism is the flow (units: moles/s). According to a simplified version of Fick's law (see p. 108), flow is proportional to the concentration difference across this barrier. Because we know from Henry's law that the concentration of a dissolved gas is proportional to its partial pressure in the gas phase, flow is also proportional to the partial-pressure difference $(\Delta \mathrm{P})$ :

$$
\text { Flow } \propto \Delta \mathrm{P}
$$

Simple diffusion is the mechanism by which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ move short distances in the respiratory system: between the air and blood in the alveoli, and between the mitochondria and blood of the peripheral circulation.

## Convection enhances diffusion by producing steeper gradients across the diffusion barrier

A purely diffusive system can establish only a relatively small $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ across the gas exchange barrier of the organism (see Fig. 26-1A). Yet, for small organisms, even this relatively small $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ is adequate to meet the demands for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ removal. However, when the organism's diameter exceeds $\sim 1 \mathrm{~mm}$, simple diffusion becomes inadequate for gas exchange. One way of ameliorating this problem is to introduce a mechanism for convection on the outside surface of the organism. For a paramecium, the beating cilia bring bulk-phase water-having a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 154 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$-very near to the cell's surface. This mixing reduces the size of the extracellular unstirred layer, thereby increasing the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and decreasing the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ on the outer surface of the organism. The net effect is that the partial-pressure gradients for both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increase across the gas exchange barrier (see Fig. 26-1B), leading to a proportionate increase in the flow of both substances.

A filter feeder, such as an oyster or a clam, pumps bulkphase water past its organ of gas exchange. Because of the relatively low solubility of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in water, such an organism may need to pump $16,000 \mathrm{~mL}$ of water to extract a mere 1 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas. In fish, which are far more efficient, the ratio may be considerably lower, $\sim 400: 1$.

In mammals, the bulk phase is the atmosphere and the external convective system is an air pump that includes the chest wall, the respiratory muscles, and the passages through which the air flows (i.e., from the nose up to the alveoli). Ventilation is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. Amphibians move air into their lungs by swallowing it. Reptiles, birds, and mammals expand their lungs by developing a negative pressure inside the thorax. Because of the

# N26-8 Gas Laws 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

In the mid-17th century, Robert Boyle demonstrated that the relation between the pressure ( $P$ ) and volume ( $V$ ) of a real gas at a fixed temperature is essentially hyperbolic. Boyle's law states that $P$ and $V$ for an ideal gas vary inversely:

$$
\mathrm{PV}=\text { Constant \#1 }
$$

(NE 26-1)
At the molecular level, the pressure exerted by a fixed number of gas molecules-the total force of gas per unit surface area of the container-reflects the number of collisions molecules make with the walls of the container. If we reduce the container's volume by half, the number of collisions doubles for each square centimeter of the container's walls, and, therefore, pressure doubles.

A century after Boyle's work, Jacques Charles found that the volume of a gas varies linearly with absolute temperature ( $T$, in kelvin) if pressure is constant:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& V=(\text { Constant \#2 }) \times T \\
& \text { or } \\
& \frac{V}{T}=\text { Constant \#2 }
\end{aligned}
$$

At the molecular level, Charles's law states that increasing the temperature increases the velocity of gas molecules, which forces the perfectly compliant container to increase in size.

Combining these two laws yields the so-called Boyle-Charles law:

$$
\frac{P V}{T}=\text { Constant \#3 }
$$

(NE 26-3)
For an ideal gas, "constant \#3" is nothing more than $n \cdot R$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R$ is the universal gas constant. Incorporating $n$ and $R$ into Equation NE 26-3 yields the ideal gas law:

$$
\mathrm{PV}=\mathrm{nRT}
$$

(NE 26-4)

If we compare the relationship among pressure, volume, and temperature for a fixed number of moles of the gas under two conditions, we see that

$$
\frac{P_{1} \cdot V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2} \cdot V_{2}}{T_{2}}
$$

(NE 26-5)
With this simple equation, one better appreciates what happens when barometric pressure increases during diving or decreases during ascent to high altitude.

The barometric pressure ( Pb ) is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the air mixture (Dalton's law; see Box 26-2). Thus, in the case of ordinary dry air (see Table 26-1), most of the sea-level Pb of 760 mm Hg is due to $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ( $\sim 593 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\sim 159 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), with smaller contributions from trace gases such as argon ( $\sim 7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ( $\sim 0.2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). Thus, as Pb increases during diving beneath the water, or as Pb decreases during ascent to high altitude, the partial pressure of each constituent gas will change in proportion to the change in Pb . This relationship is important for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to tissues, because a key variable that determines the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$ is $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the inspired air (see p. 681).

The conducting airways humidify inspired air so that it becomes fully saturated with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ vapor at body temperature (see Box 26-1). The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ vapor then occupies part of the space in the lungs. At a body temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is 47 mm Hg . If Pb is 760 mm Hg , only $760-47=713 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ is available for the sum of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Because $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ readily evaporates from (or condenses into) liquid water, its partial pressure does not change with changes in Pb .

## BOX 26-2 Partial Pressures and Henry's Law

Respiratory physiologists generally express the concentration of a gas, whether it is mixed with another gas (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ mixed with $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, as is the case for air) or dissolved in an aqueous solution (e.g., $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in water), in terms of partial pressure. Dalton's law states that the total pressure $\left(P_{\text {max }}\right)$ of a mixture of gases is the sum of their individual partial pressures. Imagine that we are dealing with an ideal gas (Z) mixed with other gases. Because the ratio of the partial pressure of $Z\left(P_{Z}\right)$ to the total pressure $\left(P_{\text {max }}\right)$ is its mole fraction $\left(X_{Z}\right)$,

$$
P_{Z}=X_{Z} \cdot P_{\text {vital }}
$$

Thus, if $\mathrm{P}_{Z}$ in one sample of gas were twice as high as in another, $\mathrm{X}_{Z}$ (i.e., concentration of Z ) would also be twice as high.

It may not be immediately obvious why-when Z is dissolved in aqueous solutions-it is still reasonable to express the concentration of $Z$ in terms of $P_{Z}$. According to Henry's law, the concentration of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in water $\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dry }}\right)$ is proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the gas phase:

$$
\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{dx}}=s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}
$$

The proportionality constant $s$ is the solubility; for $\mathrm{O}_{2}, s$ is $\sim 0.0013 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for a solution mimicking blood plasma. The solubility of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is $\sim 23$-fold higher. Consider a beaker of water at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ equilibrated with an atmosphere having a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 100 mm Hg , the partial pressure in mammalian arterial blood plasma (Fig. 26-3A, solution \#1):

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{dx}} } & =\left(0.0013 \frac{\mathrm{mM}}{\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}}\right) \cdot(100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \\
& =0.13 \mathrm{mM}
\end{aligned}
$$

Now consider a second beaker equilibrated with an atmosphere having a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg , the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in mixed-venous blood (see Fig. 26-3A, solution \#2):

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{dx}} } & =\left(0.0013 \frac{\mathrm{mM}}{\mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}}\right) \cdot(40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \\
& =0.05 \mathrm{mM}

If we now place samples of these two solutions on opposite sides of a semipermeable barrier in a closed container (see Fig. 26-3B), the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gradient across this barrier expressed in terms of concentrations $\left(\Delta\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]\right)$ is $0.13-0.05$ or 0.08 mM . Expressed in terms of partial pressures $\left(\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$, this same gradient is $100-40=60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

Imagine now that we take a $5-\mathrm{mL}$ sample of each of the solutions in the beakers in Figure 26-3A, drawing the fluid up into syringes, sealing the syringes, putting them on ice, and sending them to a clinical laboratory for analysis-as is routinely done with samples of arterial blood. Even though there is no gas phase in equilibrium with either of the solutions in the syringes, the laboratory will report the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels in millimeters of mercury ( mm Hg ). These are the partial pressures of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with which the solutions were or would have to be equilibrated to achieve the $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dx }}$ in the liquid samples.

much higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of air (about $210 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{L}$ of air at standard temperature and pressure/dry, or STPD; Box 26-3), as opposed to water ( $\sim 35 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{L}$ of water), humans need to move far less air than oysters need to move water. For example, a human may ventilate the alveoli with 4000 mL of fresh air every minute and extract from this air 250 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas, a ratio of $16: 1$.

Although we are 1000 -fold more efficient than oysters, the principle of external convective systems is the same: ensure that the external surface of the gas exchange barrier is in close contact with a fluid whose composition matches-as closely as is practical-that of the bulk phase. How "closely" is "practical"? The composition of alveolar air approaches that of wet inspired air as alveolar ventilation approaches infinity (see p. 680). Because high ventilatory rates have a significant metabolic cost, the body must trade off optimizing alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ on the one hand against minimizing the work of ventilation on the other. In the average adult human, the compromise that has evolved is an alveolar ventilation of $\sim 4000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, an alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (versus 149 mm Hg in a wet atmosphere at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ), and an alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (versus 0.2 mm Hg ).

A clinical example in which the external convective system fails is barbiturate poisoning. Here, drug intoxication inhibits the respiratory control centers in the medulla (see p. 700), so that ventilation slows or even stops. The consequence is that the unstirred layer between the bulk-phase

# BOX 26-3 Conventions for Measurement of Volumes of Gases 

## BTPS

Gases within the lung are saturated with water vapor at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (310 K). At this temperature, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1}$ is 47 mm Hg (see Box 26-1). If the glottis is open and no air is flowing, then the total pressure of the air in the lungs is Pb , which we will assume to be 760 mm Hg . In this case, the partial pressure of dry gases in the lungs is $(760-47)=713 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The convention is to report the volume of gases in the lungs-and changes in the volume of these gases-at body temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor, or BTPS. Such volumes include both wet and dry gases.

## ATPS

If a volume of air is exhaled from the lungs ( $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS }}$ ) into a spirometer, the "floor" of which is formed by water (see Fig. 26-8), the exhaled air will now be at ambient temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor, or ATPS. Thus, we must correct the volume change ( $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS }}$ ) registered by the spirometer (at ATPS) to know the volume that this same gas had occupied in the lungs (at BTPS). Two factors are at work as warm alveolar air moves into a cooler spirometer: (1) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1}$ decreases and some gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ condenses into liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, according to the temperature dependence of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1}$; and (2) the pressure exerted by the dry gas molecules decreases, according to Charles's law. (5) N26-8 If we start from the Boyle-Charles law,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PTPS}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}{\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{ATPS}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}{\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}
$$

it is possible to show that (5) N26-12

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1 \text { at }}{ }_{\text {aerobic }}\right)}{\left(\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1 \text { at }}{ }_{\text {aure }}\right)} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{T}_{\text {body }}}{\mathrm{T}_{\text {aerobart }}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}
$$

Here, $\mathrm{T}_{\text {body }}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\text {aerobart }}$ are absolute temperatures.
If $\mathrm{T}_{\text {body }}$ is $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(310 \mathrm{~K})$, then the corresponding $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1}$ is 47 mm Hg . If $\mathrm{T}_{\text {aerobart }}$ is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (or 298 K ), then the corresponding $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1}$ is 24 mm Hg . For these conditions, the conversion from an ATPS volume to a BTPS volume becomes

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}=\frac{(760-24)}{(760-47)} \cdot \frac{310 \mathrm{~K}}{298 \mathrm{~K}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}=1.074 \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}
$$

Thus, the same wet gas that occupies 1000 mL in the spirometer at ATPS occupies 1074 mL in the lungs at BTPS.

## STPD

The convention is to report the volume of gases in the blood (e.g., dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to hemoglobin) in the same way that chemists would-at standard temperature and pressure/dry, or STPD. The standard temperature is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(273 \mathrm{~K})$, and the standard pressure is 760 mm Hg . You may recall from introductory chemistry that a mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.4 L at STPD. If you wish to convert a $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{STPD}}$ to a $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{STPS}}$, it is possible to show that (5) N26-13

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}=\frac{\mathrm{Pb}}{\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Ag} 1 \text { at } \mathrm{~T}_{\text {body }}}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{T}_{\text {body }}}{\mathrm{T}_{\text {standard }}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{STPD}}
$$

For a body temperature of $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the conversion from a BTPS volume to an STPD volume becomes

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}=\frac{760}{760-47} \cdot \frac{310 \mathrm{~K}}{273 \mathrm{~K}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{STPD}}=1.21 \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{STPD}}
$$

Thus, the same dry gas that occupies 1000 mL under standard chemical conditions occupies 1210 mL in the body at BTPS.
atmosphere and the alveolar blood-gas barrier becomes extremely large (i.e., the distance between the nose and the alveoli). As a result, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls to such low levels that the $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ across the alveolar wall cannot support an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ flow and an arterial $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$ that is compatible with life. Cessation of ventilation also causes the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to rise to such high levels that the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ flow from blood to alveolar air is unacceptably low.

An external convective system maximizes gas exchange by continuously supplying bulk-phase water or air to the external surface of the gas exchange barrier, thereby maintaining a high external $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and a low external $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. A circulatory system is an internal convective system that maximizes flow of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across the gas exchange barrier by delivering, to the inner surface of this barrier, blood that has as low a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and as high a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ as is practical. Perfusion is the process of delivering blood to the lungs. Figure 26-1C shows a primitive-and hypothetical-internal convective system, one that essentially stirs the entire internal contents of the organism, so that the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the bulk internal fluids is uniform, right up to the surface of the mitochondria. The result is that the $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ across the gas exchange barrier is rather large, but the $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ between the bulk internal fluid and the mitochondria is rather small.

Figure 26-1D summarizes the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ profiles for a sophisticated circulatory system built around a fourchambered heart and separate pulmonary and systemic circulations. The circulatory system carries (by convection) low- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ blood from a systemic capillary near the mitochondria to the alveolar wall. At the beginning of a pulmonary capillary, a high alveolar-to-blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient ensures a high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ inflow (by diffusion), and blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rises to match the alveolar (i.e., external) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by the time the blood leaves the pulmonary capillary. Finally, the systemic arterial blood carries (by convection) this high- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ blood to the systemic capillaries, where a high blood-to-mitochondria $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient maximizes the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ flux into the mitochondria (by diffusion). The opposite happens with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, separate pulmonary and systemic circulations ensure maximal gradients for gas diffusion in both the pulmonary and systemic capillaries.

The scenario outlined in Figure 26-1D requires the four-chambered heart characteristic of mammals as well as of advanced reptiles and birds. The right ventricle pumps low- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} /$ high- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ blood received from the peripheral veins to the lungs, whereas the left ventricle pumps high- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} /$ low$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ blood received from pulmonary veins to the periphery (i.e., mitochondria). Maintenance of maximal gradients for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion in both the pulmonary and systemic

The basis for our derivation will be the ideal gas law:

$$
P V=n R T
$$

(NE 26-11)
We are interested in following a portion of the total volume of gas in the lungs as this volume moves from the lungs-at BTPS-to a spirometer in equilibrium with liquid water-at ATPS. In the lungs, the volume exiting is $\Delta V_{\text {BTPS. }}$. We will focus on the number of gas molecules in the volume $\Delta V_{\text {BTPS }}$ :

$$
\mathrm{n}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\text {BTPS }} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}}{\mathrm{RT}_{\text {BTPS }}}
$$

(NE 26-12)
Let us assume that the pressure inside the lungs ( $\mathrm{P}_{\text {BTPS }}$ ) is the same as barometric pressure ( Pb ), which is true when no air is flowing and the glottis is open:

$$
\mathrm{n}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\text {BTPS }}}{\mathrm{RT}_{\text {BTPS }}}
$$

(NE 26-13)
The $n$ in Equation NE 26-13 has two components: $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and the dry gases (i.e., everything other than $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). The number of dry-gas molecules is proportional to the partial pressure of the dry gases. Thus,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{n}^{\mathrm{div}} & =\frac{\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}^{\mathrm{av}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}{\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}}{\mathrm{R}}(273+37) \\
& =\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right) \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}{\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}

$$

(NE 26-15)

$$
=\frac{(713 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}{\mathrm{R} \cdot(310 \mathrm{~K})}
$$

Now, what volume would these same dry gas molecules occupy after exhalation into a spirometer at ambient temperature ( $\mathrm{T}_{\text {ATPS }}$ )? We will assume that the ambient pressure is Pb . Rearranging the ideal gas law, we get

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}^{\mathrm{av}}=\frac{\mathrm{n}^{\mathrm{div}} \cdot \mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}}
$$

(NE 26-16)
Substituting into Equation NE 26-16 the value for $\mathrm{n}^{\text {div }}$ from Equation NE 26-14 yields

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}^{\mathrm{div}}=\underbrace{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right) \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}_{\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}}-\frac{\mathrm{RT}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}}
$$

(NE 26-17)
Canceling R and rearranging terms, we get

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}^{\mathrm{div}}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}}}-\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{ATPS}}}{\mathrm{~T}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}
$$

(NE 26-18)

For example, if Pb is 760 mm Hg and ambient temperature is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then the volume occupied by the dry molecules exhaled from the lungs is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta \mathrm{V}^{\mathrm{div}} & =\frac{(760-47)}{706} \cdot \frac{(273+25)}{(273+37)} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}} \\
& =\frac{713}{760} \cdot \frac{298 \mathrm{~K}}{310 \mathrm{~K}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}} \\
& =0.902 \cdot \Delta \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{BTPS}}
\end{aligned}
$$

In other words, if the dry gas molecules occupied 1 L in the lungs, they would occupy only 902 mL in the spirometer.

However, this volume of dry-gas molecules does not represent all of the gas that we exhaled ... we also exhaled water vapor. What volume does the water vapor occupy after we exhale it into the spirometer? The answer to this question may sound a bit strange, but the volume (or number) of water molecules exhaled from the lungs does not determine the volume (or number) of water molecules in the spirometer. The reason is that the partial pressure of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the spirometer-the gas phase of which is in equilibrium with liquid $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$-depends not on the amount of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ vapor that is exhaled but only on ambient temperature. Consider four examples:

If body temperature is higher than ambient temperature (i.e., $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{NO}}$ is higher in the body than in the spirometer), then some of the exhaled $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules condense into the liquid of the spirometer. This is the usual case. Once in the spirometer, the dry-gas molecules from the lungs are accompanied by fewer gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules than had accompanied them in the lungs!

If the body temperature were the same as ambient temperature, then the number of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules that accompanied the exhaled dry gas in the lungs would be the same as the number of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules that accompany this exhaled dry gas in the spirometer. In other words, $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {BTPS }}$ would be the same as $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {BTPS }}$.

If the body temperature were lower than ambient temperature, then the exhaled $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules would be joined in the gas phase of the spirometer by additional $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules evaporating from the spirometer's liquid water. In other words, once in the spirometer, the dry-gas molecules from the lungs would be accompanied by more gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules than they had been accompanied by in the lungs!

Finally, imagine that, instead of exhaling into the spirometer a volume $\Delta V$ of BTPS air-consisting of both dry air and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ vapor-we instead introduce into the spirometer only the dry air at body temperature contained within $\Delta V_{\text {BTPS. }}$. This dry air will be joined in the gas phase of the spirometer by $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules that evaporate from the spirometer's liquid water ... and the final $\Delta V$ in the spirometer will be the same as if we had exhaled BTPS (i.e., wet) air into the spirometer!

Thus, in computing the total change in spirometer volume ( $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}$ ) we do not need to consider the number of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules exhaled from the lungs; we only need to compute how many gaseous $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules must accompany the exhaled dry-gas molecules once these dry-gas molecules are in the friendly confines of the spirometer. We will approach this problem by computing the ratio of dry to total gas molecules contained in $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS. }}$. Within the volume $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS }}$-inside the spirometer-the ratio of number of gas molecules is the same as the ratio of their respective pressures:

(NE 26-20)
Because total pressure is Pb , and because the partial pressure of the dry gases is the difference between Pb and the vapor pressure of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{n}^{\text {env }}}{\mathrm{n}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {total }}}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}

(NE 26-21)
Because the volume occupied by the gases is proportional to the number of gas molecules,

$$
\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {dev }}}{\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {total }}}=\frac{\mathrm{n}^{\text {env }}}{\mathrm{n}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {total }}}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}

(NE 26-22)
Solving for the total $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS }}$, we get

\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {total }}=\mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {dev }} \times \frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}
$$

(NE 26-23)
Equation NE 26-23 tells us that, if we know the volume that the exhaled dry gases occupy once they are in the spirometer, we can easily compute the total volume occupied by these dry molecules and their obligated $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ molecules. Substituting into Equation NE 26-23 our expression for $\Delta V$ of the dry molecules at ATPS in Equation NE 26-18, we get

$$
\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\text {total }}=\frac{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {BTPS }}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}=\frac{\mathrm{T}_{\text {ATPS }}}{\mathrm{T}_{\text {BTPS }}} \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}_{\text {BTPS }} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}{\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}-\mathrm{P}_{\text {ATPS }}^{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)}
$$

(NE 26-24)

Canceling Pb terms yields

$$

(NE 26-25)
Thus, if Pb is 760 mm Hg and ambient temperature is $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then

If we wish to convert back from $\Delta V_{\text {ATPS }}$ to $\Delta V_{\text {BTPS }}$, then the comparable equations are

Up to this point, the discussion has been identical to that in $\bigcirc$ N26-12, where we asked what volume this dry gas (as well as its obligated water vapor) would occupy at ATPS. In this webnote, we instead ask what volume these exhaled dry gas molecules would occupy at standard temperature and standard pressure. The definitions are the following:

$$

(NE 26-38)
For example, if Pb is 760 mm Hg , then the volume occupied by the dry molecules exhaled from the lungs is

In other words, if the dry gas molecules occupied 1 L in the lungs, they would occupy only 826 mL in the spirometer.

capillaries at the mitochondria requires that right and left ventricular blood not mix. However, this sort of mixing is exactly what occurs in fish and amphibians, whose hearts have a common ventricle. In these animals, the aortic blood has $P_{O_{2}}$ and $P_{C O_{2}}$ values that are intermediate between the extreme values of venous blood returning from the systemic circulation and the blood returning from the gas exchange barrier. The result is less than optimal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ gradients at both the gas exchange barrier and the mitochondria.

In humans, the internal convective system may fail when diseased heart valves cause a decrease in cardiac output. Another example is the shunting of blood between the pulmonary and the systemic circulations, as may occur in newborns with congenital anomalies (e.g., atrial or ventricular septal defects). The result is the same sort of mixing of systemic venous and gas exchange barrier blood that occurs in amphibians and fish. Thus, patients with shunts cannot establish normal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ gradients in the pulmonary and peripheral capillaries and thus cannot generate normal flows of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

## Surface area amplification enhances diffusion

The passive flow of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across a barrier is proportional not only to the concentration gradient but also to the area of the barrier: (7) N26-9

$$
\text { Flow }=\Delta \mathrm{P} \times \text { Area }
$$

Indeed, higher animals have increased their ability to exchange $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with their environment by increasing the surface area across which gas exchange takes place. For example, mollusks (e.g., squid) and fish have gills, which they form by evaginating the gas exchange barrier, thus greatly amplifying its surface area. Higher land animals amplify their gas exchange barriers by invaginating them, forming lungs. In an amphibian such as the adult frog, the lungs are simple air sacs with a relatively small surface area. Not surprisingly, a large portion of their gas exchange must occur across the skin. The gas exchange barrier is considerably more sophisticated in reptiles, which line their lungs with alveoli or even subdivide them with alveoli-lined barriers. The net effect is to increase the surface-to-volume ratio of the lungs. Mammals increase the area available for diffusion even more, by developing highly complex lungs with bronchi and a large number of alveoli.

In humans, the lung surface is so large and so thin that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport across the alveolar wall is $\sim 3$-fold faster than necessary-at least when the person is resting at sea level. Nevertheless, this redundancy is extremely important during exercise (when cardiac output can increase markedly), for life at high altitude (where the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is low), and in old age (when lung function diminishes). A substantial decrease in surface area, or thickening of the barrier, can be deleterious. Examples are the surgical removal of a lung (which reduces the total surface for gas exchange by about half) and pulmonary edema (which increases the effective thickness of the barrier). Thus, if an individual with a thickened barrier loses a lung, the remaining surface area may not be large enough to sustain adequate rates of gas exchange.

## Respiratory pigments such as hemoglobin increase the carrying capacity of the blood for both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

In mammals, the external convective system (i.e., ventilatory apparatus), the internal convective system (i.e., circulatory system), and the barrier itself (i.e., alveolar wall) are so efficient that the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is not what limits the exchange of gases, at least not in healthy subjects at sea level.

Imagine what would happen if the mixed-venous blood flowing down a pulmonary capillary contained only water and salts. The diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the alveolar air space into the "blood" is so fast-and the solubility of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in saline is so low (see Box 26-2)-that before the blood could move $\sim 1 \%$ of the way down the capillary, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the blood would match the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the alveolar air (i.e., all of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that could move would have moved). For the remaining $\sim 99 \%$ of the capillary, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient across the barrier would be nil, and no more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would flow into the blood. As a result, at a normal cardiac output, the blood could never carry away enough $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the tissues to sustain life. The same would be true in reverse for the elimination of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Animals solve this problem with respiratory pigments, specialized metalloproteins that-via the metal-reversibly bind $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, greatly increasing the carrying capacity of blood for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. In some arthropods and mollusks, the pigment is hemocyanin, which coordinates two copper atoms. Polychaete worms and brachiopods use hemerythrins, which coordinate two iron atoms. However, the most common-and most efficient-respiratory pigments are the hemoglobins, which coordinate a porphyrin ring that contains iron. All vertebrates as well as numerous unrelated groups of animals use hemoglobin, which is the chief component of erythrocytes or red blood cells.

The presence of hemoglobin markedly improves the dynamics of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by blood passing through the lungs. Under normal conditions, hemoglobin reversibly binds $\sim 96 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that diffuses from the alveolar air spaces to the pulmonary-capillary blood, greatly increasing the carrying capacity of blood for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Hemoglobin also plays a key role in the transport or carriage of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ by reversibly binding $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and by acting as a powerful pH buffer. In anemia, the hemoglobin content of blood is reduced, thus lowering the carrying capacity of blood for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. An individual with anemia can compensate only if the systemic tissues extract more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from each liter of blood or if cardiac output increases. However, there are limits to the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that tissues can extract or to the level to which the heart can increase its output.

## Pathophysiology recapitulates phylogeny ... in reverse

It should be clear from the pathophysiological examples discussed that when a key component of the respiratory system fails in a higher organism, external respiration becomes more like that of an organism lower on the evolutionary ladder. For example, a failure of a mammal's air pump makes this individual behave more like a unicellular aquatic organism without cilia. A reduction in the surface area of the alveoli in a mammal creates the same problems faced by an amphibian with simple sack-like lungs. A major shunt in the circulatory system makes a mammal behave more like a fish.

# N26-9 Flow Versus Flux 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

On page 595 of the text, we state that the flow of a gas across the blood-gas barrier is proportional to (1) the driving force-in this case the partial-pressure gradient ( $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ ) of the gas-across the barrier, and (2) the area of the barrier. This concept is embodied in Equation 26-2 (shown here as Equation NE 26-6):

$$
\text { Flow }=\Delta \mathrm{P} \times \text { Area } \quad(\text { NE 26-6) }
$$

Note that flow has the units of mass per unit time, such as $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{s}$. The flow per unit area is known as the flux, which might have the units of $\mathrm{mL} /\left(\mathrm{cm}^{2} \mathrm{~s}\right)$. Thus, the area term does not appear in the equation that describes flux:

$$
\text { Flux }=\Delta \mathrm{P}
$$

(NE 26-7)
Equation NE 26-7 is a restatement of Fick's law, which we introduced in the text in Equation 5-13 and also Equation 20-4. For a more detailed discussion of Fick's law see (2) N20-2.

In the case of the lung, pulmonary specialists do not work with flux values, but with flow values because the surface area over which diffusion occurs is generally not known.

In severe anemia, a mammal faces the same problems as a lower life form with a less efficient respiratory pigment.

## ORGANIZATION OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM IN HUMANS

## Humans optimize each aspect of external respirationventilation, circulation, area amplification, gas carriage, local control, and central control

The human respiratory system (Fig. 26-4) has two important characteristics. First, it uses highly efficient convective systems (i.e., ventilatory and circulatory systems) for longdistance transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Second, it reserves diffusion exclusively for short-distance movements of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The key components of this respiratory system are the following:

1. An air pump. The external convective system consists of the upper respiratory tract and large pulmonary airways,
![bo07465312c5](bo07465312c5.jpg)

Figure 26-4 Respiratory apparatus in humans.
the thoracic cavity and associated skeletal elements, and the muscles of respiration. These components deliver air to and remove air from the alveolar air spaces-alveolar ventilation. Inspiration occurs when muscle contractions increase the volume of the thoracic cavity, thereby lowering intrathoracic pressure; this causes the alveoli to expand passively, which in turn lowers alveolar pressure. Air then flows from the environment to the alveoli, down a pressure gradient. A quiet expiration occurs when the muscles relax. We discuss the mechanics of ventilation in Chapter 27.
2. Mechanisms for carrying $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood. Red blood cells are highly specialized for transporting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to the peripheral tissues and for transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the opposite direction. They have extremely high levels of hemoglobin and other components that help to rapidly load and unload huge amounts of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In the pulmonary capillaries, hemoglobin binds $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, thereby enabling the blood to carry $\sim 65$-fold more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than saline. In the systemic capillaries, hemoglobin plays a key role in the carriage of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-produced by the mitochondria-to the lungs. Hemoglobin accomplishes this task by chemically reacting with some of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and by buffering the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$formed as carbonic anhydrase converts $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Thus, hemoglobin plays a central role in acid-base chemistry, as discussed in Chapter 28, as well as in the carriage of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, treated in Chapter 29.
3. A surface for gas exchange. The gas exchange barrier in humans consists of the alveoli, which provide a huge but extremely thin surface area for passive diffusion of gases between the alveolar air spaces and the pulmonary capillaries. We discuss the anatomy of the alveoli below in this chapter and explore pulmonary gas exchange in Chapter 30. A similar process of gas exchange occurs between the systemic capillaries and mitochondria.
4. A circulatory system. The internal convective system in humans consists of a four-chambered heart and separate systemic and pulmonary circulations. We discuss the flow of blood to the lungs-perfusion-in Chapter 31.
5. A mechanism for locally regulating the distribution of ventilation and perfusion. Efficient gas exchange requires that the ratio of ventilation to perfusion be uniform for all alveoli to the extent possible. However, neither the delivery of fresh air to the entire population of alveoli nor the delivery of mixed-venous blood to the entire population of pulmonary capillaries is uniform throughout the lungs. The lungs attempt to maximize the uniformity of ventilation-perfusion ratios by using sophisticated feedback control mechanisms to regulate local air flow and blood flow, as discussed in Chapter 31.
6. A mechanism for centrally regulating ventilation. Unlike the rhythmicity of the heart, which is intrinsic to that organ, that of the respiratory system is not intrinsic to the lungs or the chest wall. Instead, respiratory control centers in the central nervous system rhythmically stimulate the muscles of inspiration. Moreover, these respiratory centers appropriately modify the pattern of ventilation during exercise or other changes in physical or mental activity. Sensors for arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH are part of feedback loops that stabilize these three "blood gas" parameters. We discuss these subjects in Chapter 32.

Respiratory physiologists have agreed on a set of symbols to describe parameters that are important for pulmonary physiology and pulmonary function testing (Table 26-2).

## Conducting airways deliver fresh air to the alveolar spaces

We will discuss lung development on pages 1155-1156. In the embryo, each lung invaginates into a separate pleural sac, which reflects over the surface of the lung.

The parietal pleura, the wall of the sac that is farthest from the lung, contains blood vessels that are believed to produce an ultrafiltrate of the plasma called pleural fluid. About 10 mL of this fluid normally occupies the virtual space between the parietal and the visceral pleura. The visceral pleura lies directly on the lung and contains lymphatics that drain the fluid from the pleural space. When the production of pleural fluid exceeds its removal, the volume of pleural fluid increases (pleural effusion), limiting the expansion of the lung. Under normal circumstances, the pleural fluid probably lubricates the pleural space, facilitating physiological changes in lung size and shape.

The lungs themselves are divided into lobes, three in the right lung (i.e., upper, middle, and lower lobes) and two in the left (i.e., upper and lower lobes). The right lung, which is less encumbered than the left by the presence of the heart, makes up $\sim 55 \%$ of total lung mass and function.

We refer to the progressively bifurcating pulmonary airways by their generation number (Fig. 26-5): The zeroth generation is the trachea, the first-generation airways are
the right and left mainstem bronchi, and so on. Inasmuch as the right mainstem bronchus has a greater diameter than the left and is more nearly parallel with the trachea, inhaled foreign bodies more commonly lodge in the right lung than in the left. Humans have $\sim 23$ generations of airways. As generation number increases (i.e., as airways become smaller), the amount of cilia, the number of mucussecreting cells, the presence of submucosal glands, and the amount of cartilage in the airway walls all gradually decrease. The mucus is important for trapping small foreign particles. The cilia sweep the carpet of mucus-kept moist by secretions from the submucosal glands-up toward the pharynx, where swallowing eventually disposes of the mucus. The cartilage is important for preventing airway collapse, which is especially a problem during expiration (see Chapter 27). Airways maintain some cartilage to about the 10th generation, up to which point they are referred to as bronchi.

Beginning at about the 11th generation, the now cartilagefree airways are called bronchioles. Because they lack cartilage, bronchioles can maintain a patent lumen only because the pressure surrounding them may be more negative than the pressure inside and because of the outward pull (radial traction or tethering) of surrounding tissues. Thus, bronchioles are especially susceptible to collapse during expiration. Up until generation $\sim 16$, no alveoli are present, and the air cannot exchange with the pulmonary-capillary blood. The airways from the nose and lips down to the alveoli-free bronchioles are the conducting airways, which serve only to move air by convection (i.e., like water moving through a pipe) to those regions of the lung that participate in gas exchange. The most distal conducting airways are the terminal bronchioles (generation $\sim 16$ ). The aggregate volume of conducting airways, the anatomical dead space, amounts to $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$ in healthy young males and $>100 \mathrm{~mL}$ in females. The anatomical dead space is only a small fraction of the total lung capacity, which averages 5 to 6 L in adults, depending on the size and health of the individual.

## Alveolar air spaces are the site of gas exchange

Alveoli first appear budding off bronchioles at generation $\sim 17$. These respiratory bronchioles participate in gas exchange over at least part of their surface. Respiratory bronchioles extend from generation $\sim 17$ to generation $\sim 19$, the density of alveoli gradually increasing with generation number (see Fig. 26-5). Eventually, alveoli completely line the airways. These alveolar ducts (generations 20 to 22 ) finally terminate blindly as alveolar sacs (generation 23). The aggregation of all airways arising from a single terminal bronchiole (i.e., the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveolar sacs), along with their associated blood and lymphatic vessels, is a terminal respiratory unit or primary lobule.

The cross-sectional area of the trachea is $\sim 2.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. Unlike the situation in systemic arteries (see p. 447), in which the aggregate cross-sectional area of the branches always exceeds the cross-sectional area of the parent vessel, the aggregate cross-sectional area falls from the trachea through the first four generations of airways (Fig. 26-6). Because all of the air that passes through the trachea also passes through the two

![bo09465312c5](bo09465312c5.jpg)

Figure 26-6 Dependence of aggregate cross-sectional area and of linear velocity on generation number. At generation 3, the aggregate cross-sectional area has a minimum (not visible) where velocity has its maximum. (Data from Bouhuys A: The Physiology of Breathing. New York, Grune \& Stratton, 1977.)

mainstem bronchi and so on, the product of aggregate crosssectional area and linear velocity is the same for each generation of conducting airways. Thus, the linear velocity of air in the first four generations is higher than that in the trachea, which may be important during coughing (see p. 719). In succeeding generations, the aggregate crosssectional area rises, at first slowly and then very steeply. As a result, the linear velocity falls to very low values. For example the terminal bronchioles (generation 16) have an aggregate cross-sectional area of $\sim 180 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, so that the average linear velocity of the air is only $\left(2.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right) /\left(180 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}\right)$ $=1.4 \%$ of the value in the trachea.

As air moves into the respiratory bronchioles and further into the terminal respiratory unit, where linear velocity is minuscule, convection becomes less and less important for the movement of gas molecules, and diffusion dominates. Notice that the long-distance movement of gases from the nose and lips to the end of the generation-16 airways occurs by convection. However, the short-distance movement of gases from generation-17 airways to the farthest reaches of the alveolar ducts occurs by diffusion, as does the movement of gases across the gas exchange barrier $(\sim 0.6 \mu \mathrm{~m})$.

The alveolus is the fundamental unit of gas exchange. Alveoli are hemispheric structures with diameters that range from 75 to $300 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. The $\sim 300$ million alveoli have a combined surface area of 50 to $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ and an aggregate maximal volume of 5 to 6 L in the two lungs. Both the diameter and the surface area depend on the degree of lung inflation. The lungs have a relatively modest total volume (i.e., $\sim 5.5 \mathrm{~L}$ ), very little of which is invested in conducting airways (i.e., $\sim 0.15 \mathrm{~L}$ ). However, the alveolar area is tremendously amplified. For example, a sphere with a volume of 5.5 L would have a surface area of only $0.16 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, which is far less than $1 \%$ of the alveolar surface area.

The alveolar lining consists of two types of epithelial cells, type I and type II alveolar pneumocytes. The cuboidal type II cells exist in clusters and are responsible for elaborating pulmonary surfactant, which substantially eases the expansion of the lungs (see pp. 613-614). The type I cells are much thinner than the type II cells. Thus, even though the two cell types are present in about equal numbers, the type I cells cover $90 \%$ to $95 \%$ of the alveolar surface and represent the shortest route for gas diffusion. After an injury, type I cells slough and degenerate, whereas type II cells proliferate and line the alveolar space, re-establishing a continuous epithelial layer. Thus, the type II cells appear to serve as repair cells.

The pulmonary capillaries are usually sandwiched between two alveolar air spaces. In fact, the blood forms an almost uninterrupted sheet that flows like a twisted ribbon between abutting alveoli. At the type I cells, the alveolar wall (i.e., pneumocyte plus endothelial cell) is typically 0.15 to $0.30 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick. Small holes (pores of Kohn) $\rightarrow$ 825-10 perforate the septum separating two abutting alveoli. The function of these pores, which are surrounded by capillaries, is unknown.

The lung receives two blood supplies: the pulmonary arteries and the bronchial arteries (Fig. 26-7). The pulmonary arteries, by far the major blood supply to the lung, carry the relatively deoxygenated mixed-venous blood. After arising from the right ventricle, they bifurcate as they follow the bronchial tree, and their divisions ultimately form a
![bo10465312c5](bo10465312c5.jpg)

dense, richly anastomosing, hexagonal array of capillary segments that supply the alveoli of the terminal respiratory unit. The pulmonary capillaries have an average internal diameter of $\sim 8 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, and each segment of the capillary network is $\sim 10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length. The average erythrocyte spends $\sim 0.75$ second in the pulmonary capillaries as it traverses up to three alveoli. After gas exchange in the alveoli, the blood eventually collects in the pulmonary veins.

The bronchial arteries are branches of the aorta and thus carry freshly oxygenated blood. They supply the conducting airways. At the level of the respiratory bronchioles, capillaries derived from bronchial arteries anastomose with those derived from pulmonary arteries. Because capillaries of the bronchial circulation drain partially into pulmonary veins, there is some venous admixture of the partially deoxygenated blood from the bronchial circulation and the newly oxygenated blood (see p. 891). This mixing represents part of a small physiological shunt. A small amount of the bronchial blood drains into the azygos and accessory hemiazygos veins.

# N26-10 Pores of Kohn 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The so-called pores of Kohn are named after H.N. Kohn, who in 1893 described pores through the alveolar wall in lungs from patients with pneumonia. He thought that these pores were pathological. However, nearly a half-century earlier, others had described alveolar pores in normal lungs. Kohn's mentor later named the pores after his student, and the name stuck.

Modern ultrastructural findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pores of Kohn are fixation artifacts. If lungs are fixed by instilling the fixative into the trachea, one can observe small holes in the alveolar wall (Cordingley, 1972). However, if the lungs are fixed by perfusing the pulmonary blood vessels, the alveolar wall is continuous (i.e., no pores are to be seen).

Whether the pores are fixation artifacts or not, they are so small (about half the diameter of a pulmonary capillary) that it is unlikely that they play an important role in collateral ventilation; that is, the movement of air between adjacent alveoli.

For an excellent review, consult Mitzner's chapter in The Lung.

## The lungs play important nonrespiratory roles, including filtering the blood, serving as a reservoir for the left ventricle, and performing several biochemical conversions

Although their main function is to exchange $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the atmosphere and the blood, the lungs also play important roles that are not directly related to external respiration.

Olfaction Ventilation is essential for delivery of odorants to the olfactory epithelium (see pp. 354-356). Sniffing behavior, especially important for some animals, allows one to sample the chemicals in the air without the risk of bringing potentially noxious agents deep into the lungs.

Processing of Inhaled Air Before It Reaches the Alveoli Strictly speaking, the warming, moisturizing, and filtering of inhaled air in the conducting airways is a respiratory function. It is part of the cost of doing the business of ventilation. Warming of cool, inhaled air is important so that gas exchange in the alveoli takes place at body temperature. If the alveoli and the associated blood were substantially cooler than body temperature, the solubility of these alveolar gases in the cool pulmonary-capillary blood would be relatively high. As the blood later warmed, the solubility of these gases would decrease, resulting in air bubbles (i.e., emboli) that could lodge in small systemic vessels and cause infarction. Moisturizing is important to prevent the alveoli from becoming desiccated. Finally, filtering of large particles is important to prevent small airways from being clogged with debris that may also be toxic.

Warming, moisturizing, and filtering are all more efficient with nose breathing than with mouth breathing. The nose, including the nasal turbinates, has a huge surface area and a rich blood supply. Nasal hairs tend to filter out large particles (greater than $\sim 15 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter). The turbulence set up by these hairs-as well as the highly irregular surface topography of the nasal passages-increases the likelihood that particles larger than $\sim 10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter will impact and embed themselves in the mucus that coats the nasal mucosa. Moreover, air inspired through the nose makes a right-angle turn as it heads toward the trachea. The inertia of larger particles causes them to strike the posterior wall of the nasopharynx, which coincidentally is endowed with large amounts of lymphatic tissue that can mount an immunological attack on inspired microbes. Of the larger particles that manage to escape filtration in the upper airways, almost all will impact the mucus of the trachea and the bronchi.

Smaller particles ( 2 to $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter) also may impact a mucus layer. In addition, gravity may cause them to sediment from the slowly moving air in small airways and to become embedded in mucus. Particles with diameters below $\sim 0.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ tend to reach the alveoli suspended in the air as aerosols. The airways do not trap most ( $\sim 80 \%$ ) of these aerosols but expel them in the exhaled air.

The lung has a variety of strategies for dealing with particles that remain on the surface of the alveoli or penetrate into the interstitial space. Alveolar macrophages (on the surface) or interstitial macrophages may phagocytose these particles, enzymes may degrade them, or lymphatics may
carry them away. In addition, particles suspended in the fluid covering the alveolar surface may flow with this fluid up to terminal bronchioles, where they meet a layer of mucus that the cilia propel up to progressively larger airways. There, they join larger particles-which entered the mucus by impaction or sedimentation-on their journey to the oropharynx. Coughing and sneezing (see Box 32-4), reflexes triggered by airway irritation, accelerate the movement of particulates up the conducting airways.

Left Ventricular Reservoir The highly compliant pulmonary vessels of the prototypic $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human contain $\sim 440 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood (see Table 19-2), which is an important buffer for filling of the left ventricle. For example, if one clamps the pulmonary artery of an experimental animal so that no blood may enter the lungs, the left heart can suck enough blood from the pulmonary circulation to sustain cardiac output for about two beats.

Filtering Small Emboli from the Blood The mixed-venous blood contains microscopic emboli, small particles (e.g., blood clots, fat, air bubbles) capable of occluding blood vessels. If these emboli were to reach the systemic circulation and lodge in small vessels that feed tissues with no collateral circulation, the consequences-over time-could be catastrophic. Fortunately, the pulmonary vasculature can trap these emboli before they have a chance to reach the left heart. If the emboli are sufficiently few and small, the affected alveoli can recover their function. Keep in mind that alveolar cells do not need the circulation to provide them with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ or to remove their $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In addition, after a small pulmonary embolism, alveolar cells may obtain nutrients from anastomoses with the bronchial circulation. However, if pulmonary emboli are sufficiently large or frequent, they can cause serious symptoms or even death. A liability of the blood filtration function is that emboli made up of cancer cells may find the perfect breeding ground for support of metastatic disease.

Biochemical Reactions The entire cardiac output passes through the lungs, exposing the blood to the tremendous surface area of the pulmonary-capillary endothelium. It is apparently these cells that are responsible for executing biochemical reactions that selectively remove many agents from the circulation while leaving others unaffected (Table 26-3). Thus, the lung can be instrumental in determining which

signaling molecules in the mixed-venous blood reach the systemic arterial blood. The pulmonary endothelium also plays an important role in converting angiotensin I (a decapeptide) to angiotensin II (an octapeptide), a reaction that is catalyzed by angiotensin-converting enzyme (see p. 841).

## LUNG VOLUMES AND CAPACITIES

## The spirometer measures changes in lung volume

The maximal volume of all the airways in an adult-the nasopharynx, the trachea, and all airways down to the alveolar sacs-is typically 5 to 6 L . Respiratory physiologists have defined a series of lung "volumes" and "capacities" that, although not corresponding to a particular anatomical locus, are easy to measure with simple laboratory instruments and that convey useful information for clinical assessment.

A spirometer measures the volume of air inspired and expired and therefore the change in lung volume. Spirometers today are complex computers, many so small that they can easily be held in the palm of one hand. The subject blows against a predetermined resistance, and the device performs all the calculations and interpretations. Nevertheless, the principles of spirometric analysis are very much the same as those for the "old-fashioned" spirometer shown in Figure 26-8A, which is far easier to conceptualize. This simple

spirometer has a movable inverted bell that is partially submerged in water. An air tube extends from the subject's mouth, through the water, and emerges in the bell, just above water level. Thus, when the subject exhales, air enters the bell and lifts it. The change in bell elevation, which we can record on moving paper, is proportional to the volume of air that the subject exhales. Because air in the lungs is saturated with water vapor at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (body temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor, or BTPS), and the air in the spirometer is ambient temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor, or ATPS, we must apply a temperature correction to the spirometer reading (see Box 26-3).

The amount of air entering and leaving the lungs with each breath is the tidal volume ( $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ or TV ). During quiet respirations, the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ is $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$. The initial portion of the spirograph of Figure 26-8B illustrates changes in lung volume during quiet breathing. The product of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ and the frequency of breaths is total ventilation, given in liters (BTPS) per minute.

Because, with a typical Western diet, metabolism consumes more $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\sim 250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min})$ than it produces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ( $\sim 200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$; see pp. 1187-1188), the volume of air entering the body with each breath is slightly greater ( $\sim 1 \%$ ) than the volume leaving. In reporting changes in lung volume, respiratory physiologists have chosen to measure the volume leaving-the expired lung volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}\right)$.

## B SPIROGRAPHIC RECORD

![bo12465312c5](bo12465312c5.jpg)

At the end of a quiet inspiration, the additional volume of air that the subject could inhale with a maximal effort is known as the inspiratory reserve volume (IRV). The magnitude of IRV depends on several factors, including the following:

1. Current lung volume. The greater the lung volume after inspiration, the smaller the IRV.
2. Lung compliance. A decrease in compliance, a measure of how easy it is to inflate the lungs, will cause IRV to fall as well.
3. Muscle strength. If the respiratory muscles are weak, or if their innervation is compromised, IRV will decrease.
4. Comfort. Pain associated with injury or disease limits the desire or ability to make a maximal inspiratory effort.
5. Flexibility of the skeleton. Joint stiffness, caused by diseases such as arthritis and kyphoscoliosis (i.e., curvature of the spine), reduces the maximal volume to which one can inflate the lungs.
6. Posture. IRV falls when a subject is in a recumbent position, because it is more difficult for the diaphragm to move the abdominal contents.

After a quiet expiration, the additional volume of air that one can expire with a maximal effort is the expiratory reserve volume (ERV). The magnitude of the ERV depends on the same factors listed before and on the strength of abdominal and other muscles needed to produce a maximal expiratory effort.

Even after a maximal expiratory effort, a considerable amount of air remains inside the lungs-the residual volume (RV). Because a spirometer can measure only the air entering or leaving the lungs, it obviously is of no use in ascertaining the RV. However, we will see that other methods are available to measure RV. Is it a design flaw for the lungs to contain air that they cannot exhale? Would it not be better for the lungs to exhale all their air and to collapse completely during a maximal expiration? Total collapse would be detrimental for at least two reasons: (1) After an airway collapses, an unusually high pressure is required to reinflate it. By minimizing airway collapse, the presence of an RV optimizes energy expenditure. (2) Blood flow to the lungs and other parts of the body is continuous, even though ventilation is episodic. Thus, even after a maximal expiratory effort, the RV allows a continuous exchange of gases between mixedvenous blood and alveolar air. If the RV were extremely low, the composition of blood leaving the lungs would oscillate widely between a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at the peak of inspiration and a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at the nadir of expiration.

The four primary volumes that we have defined-TV, IRV, ERV, and RV—do not overlap (see Fig. 26-8B). The lung capacities are various combinations of these four primary volumes:

1. Total lung capacity (TLC) is the sum of all four volumes.
2. Functional residual capacity (FRC) is the sum of ERV and RV and is the amount of air remaining inside the respiratory system after a quiet expiration. Because FRC includes RV, we cannot measure it using only a spirometer.
3. Inspiratory capacity (IC) is the sum of IRV and TV. After a quiet expiration, the IC is the maximal amount of air that one could still inspire.
4. Vital capacity (VC) is the sum of IRV, TV, and ERV. In other words, VC is the maximal achievable TV and depends on the same factors discussed above for IRV and ERV. In patients with pulmonary disease, the physician may periodically monitor VC to follow the progress of the disease.

At the end of the spirographic record in Figure 26-8B, the subject made a maximal inspiratory effort and then exhaled as rapidly and completely as possible. The volume of air exhaled in 1 second under these conditions is the forced expiratory volume in 1 second $\left(\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right)$. In healthy young adults, $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is $\sim 80 \%$ of VC. $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ depends on all the factors that affect VC as well as on airway resistance. Thus, $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is a valuable measurement for monitoring a variety of pulmonary disorders and the effectiveness of treatment.

## The volume of distribution of helium or nitrogen in the lung is an estimate of the RV

Although we cannot use a spirometer to measure RV or any capacity containing RV (i.e., FRC or TLC), we can use two general approaches to measure RV, both based on the law of conservation of mass. In the first approach, we compute RV from the volume of distribution of either helium ( He ) or nitrogen $\left(\mathrm{N}_{2}\right)$. However, any nontoxic gas would do, as long as it does not rapidly cross the blood-gas barrier. In the second approach, discussed in the next section, we compute RV by the use of Boyle's law.

The principle underlying the volume of distribution approach is that the concentration of a substance is the ratio of mass (in moles) to volume (in liters). If the mass is constant, and if we can measure the mass and concentration, then we can calculate the volume of the physiological compartment in which the mass is distributed. In our case, we ask the subject to breathe a gas that cannot escape from the airways. From the experimentally determined mass and concentration of that gas, we calculate lung volume.

Helium-Dilution Technique We begin with a spirometer containing air with $10 \% \mathrm{He}$-this is the initial He concentration, $[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {initial }}=10 \%$ (Fig. 26-9A). We use He because it is poorly soluble in water and therefore diffuses slowly across the alveolar wall (see pp. 661-663). In this example, the initial spirometer volume, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}, \text { initial }}$, including all air up to the valve at the subject's mouth, is 2 L . The amount of He in the spirometer system at the outset of our experiment is thus $[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {initial }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}, \text { initial }}$, or $(10 \%) \times(2 \mathrm{~L})=0.2 \mathrm{~L}$.

We now open the valve at the mouth and allow the subject to breathe spirometer air until the He distributes evenly throughout the spirometer and airways. After equilibration, the final He concentration $\left([\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}\right)$ is the same in the airways as it is in the spirometer. The volume of the "system"the spirometer volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}\right)$ plus lung volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$-is fixed from the instant that we open the valve between the spirometer and the mouth. When the subject inhales, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}$ decreases by an equal amount. When the subject exhales, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ decreases and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}$ increases, but $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}+\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}\right)$ remains unchanged. Because the system does not lose He , the total He content after equilibration must be the same as it was at the outset. In our example, we assume that $[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}$ is $5 \%$.

B NITROGEN-WASHOUT TECHNIQUE
![bo14465312c5](bo14465312c5.jpg)

Figure 26-9 Volume-of-distribution and plethysmographic methods for measurement of lung volume. In $\mathbf{C}$, the spirometer is usually replaced in modern plethysmographs by an electronic pressure gauge. In such instruments, the change in lung volume is computed from the change in pressure inside the plethysmograph (see Fig. 27-11).

If the spirometer and lung volumes at the end of the experiment are the same as those at the beginning, (5) N26-11

$$
[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {initial }} \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}=[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }} \cdot\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}}+\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)
$$

Solving for lung volume, we get

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{S}} \cdot\left(\frac{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {initial }}}{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}}-1\right)
$$

If we now insert the values from our experiment,

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=2 \mathrm{~L} \cdot\left(\frac{10 \%}{5 \%}-1\right)=2 \mathrm{~L}
$$

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ corresponds to the lung volume at the instant we open the valve and allow He to begin equilibrating. If we wish to measure FRC, we open the valve just after the completion of a quiet expiration. If we open the valve after a maximal expiration, then the computed $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is RV. Because the subject rebreathes the air mixture in the spirometer until [He] stabilizes, the He-dilution approach is a closed-circuit method.
$\mathbf{N}_{2}$-Washout Method Imagine that you have a paper cup that contains a red soft drink. You plan to "empty" the cup but wish to know the "residual volume" of soft drink that will remain stuck to the inside of the cup $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\text {cup }}\right)$ after it is emptied. First, before emptying the cup, you determine the concentration of red dye in the soft drink; this is [red dye] ${ }_{\text {cup }}$. Now empty the cup. Although you do not yet know $\mathrm{V}_{\text {cup }}$, the product [red dye] ${ }_{\text {cup }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\text {cup }}$ is the mass of residual red dye that remains in the cup. Next, add hot water to the cup, swish it around inside the glass, and dump the now reddish water into a graduated cylinder. After repeating this exercise several times, you see that virtually all the red dye is now in the graduated cylinder. Finally, determine the volume of fluid in the cylinder $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\text {cylinder }}\right)$ and measure its red dye concentration. Because $[\text { red dye }]_{\text {cup }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\text {cup }}$ is the same as [red dye $]_{\text {cylinder }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\text {cylinder }}$, you can easily calculate the residual volume of the soft drink that had been in the glass. This is the principle behind the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout method.

Assume that the initial lung volume is $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and that the initial concentration of nitrogen gas in the lungs is $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }}$. Thus, the mass of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the lungs at the outset is $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }} \times$ $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. We now ask the subject to breathe through a mouthpiece equipped with a special valve (see Fig. 26-9B). During inspiration, the air comes from a reservoir of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$; the key point is that this inspired air contains no $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. During expiration, the exhaled air goes to a sack with an initial volume of zero. Each inspiration of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ dilutes the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the lungs. Each expiration sends a fraction of the remaining $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ into the sack. Thus, the $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ in the lungs falls stepwise with each breath until eventually the subject has washed out into the sack virtually all the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ that had initially been in the lungs. Also entering the sack are some of the inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and all expired $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The standard period for washing out of the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ with normal breathing is 7 minutes, after which the sack has a volume of $\mathrm{V}_{\text {sack }}$ and an $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ concentration of $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {sack }}$. Because
the mass of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ now in the sack is the same as that previously in the lungs,

$$
\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }} \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {sack }} \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\text {sack }}
$$

Thus, the lung volume is

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=\mathrm{V}_{\text {sack }} \cdot \frac{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {sack }}}{\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }}}
$$

To illustrate, consider an instance in which $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {initial }}$ is $75 \%$. If the volume of gas washed into the sack is 40 L , there is roughly a total ventilation of $6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ for 7 minutes, and $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]_{\text {sack }}$ is $3.75 \%$, then

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=40 \mathrm{~L} \cdot \frac{3.75 \%}{75 \%}=2 \mathrm{~L}
$$

What particular lung volume or capacity does $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ represent? The computed $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is the lung volume at the instant the subject begins to inhale the $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Therefore, if the subject had just finished a quiet expiration before beginning to inhale the $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would be FRC; if the subject had just finished a maximal expiratory effort, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would represent RV.

The key element in the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout method is the requirement that during the period of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ breathing, all $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ previously in the lungs-and no more-end up in the sack. In other words, we assume that $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ does not significantly diffuse between blood and alveolar air during our 7-minute experiment. Because $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ has a low water solubility, and therefore the amount dissolved in body fluids is very low at normal barometric pressure, the rate of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ diffusion across the alveolar wall is very low (see pp. 661-663). Thus, our assumption is very nearly correct. In principle, we could preload the lung with any nontoxic, water-insoluble gas (e.g., He), and then wash it out with any different gas (e.g., room air). Because the subject inhales from one reservoir and exhales into another in the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout method, it is an open-system technique.

## The plethysmograph, together with Boyle's law, is a tool for estimation of RV

We also can compute $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ from small changes in lung pressure and volume that occur as a subject attempts to inspire through an obstructed airway. This approach is based on Boyle's law, which states that if the temperature and number of gas molecules are constant, the product of pressure and volume is a constant:

$$
\mathrm{P} \cdot \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}}=\text { Constant }
$$

To take advantage of this relationship, we have the subject step inside an airtight box called a plethysmograph (from the Greek plethein [to be full]), which is similar to a telephone booth. The subject breathes through a tube that is connected to the outside world (see Fig. 26-9C). Attached to this tube is a gauge that registers pressure at the mouth and an electronically controlled shutter that can, on command, completely obstruct the tube. The Mead-type

# N26-11 Helium-Dilution Technique 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the text, we assumed that the spirometer volume $\left(V_{S}\right)$ at the time we opened the stopcock in Figure 26-9A was the same as the spirometer volume at the end of the experiment. We also implicitly assumed that the same was true of the lung volume $\left(V_{L}\right)$. However, this need not be true. At the instant we open the stopcock, the total volume of the system-that is, the sum of $V_{S}$ and $V_{L}$-is in principle a constant. As the subject inhales, the $V_{L}$ increases but $V_{S}$ decreases, and vice versa. If the spirometer volume at the end of the experiment $\left(V_{S, t r a l}\right)$ were different from the spirometer volume at the beginning $\left(V_{S, \text { intial }}\right)$, then Equation $26-3$ in the text would be replaced by the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {total }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\text {S,intial }}=[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {trial }} \cdot \underbrace{\left(\mathrm{V}_{\text {S,final }}+\mathrm{V}_{\text {L, final }}\right)}_{\text {Total volume }} \cdot \underbrace{(\text { NE 26-8) }} \\
& \text { of system }
\end{aligned}
$$

Here, $[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {intial }}$ is the initial concentration of helium in the spirometer and $[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}$ is the final concentration of helium in the spirometer and in the lung's airways. Thus, solving for final lung volume $\left(V_{L, t r a l}\right)$, we get

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}, \text { final }}=\frac{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {intial }} \times \mathrm{V}_{\text {S, intial }}}{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}}-\mathrm{V}_{\text {S, final }}
$$

If we use the above equation, it does not matter whether the initial and final spirometer volumes are the same. The computed $V_{L, t r a l}$ is the lung volume at the instant we take a reading of $V_{S, t r a l}$. For example, even if the lungs were at FRC at the instant that the stopcock was opened (i.e., at the beginning of the experiment), if the lungs were at RV at the time we measure $V_{L, t r a l}$, (i.e., at the end of the experiment) then Equation NE 26-9 will yield RV. In fact, $V_{L, t r a l}$ can be anywhere between the RV and TLC.

If, at the end of the experiment, the subject adjusts his or her lung volume to be the same as at the beginning, then the initial and final spirometer volumes will also be the same (i.e., $\left.V_{S, \text { intial }}=V_{S, t r a l}\right)$. In this case, Equation NE 26-9 simplifies to Equation 26-4 (shown here as Equation NE 26-10):

$$
V_{L}=V_{S} \cdot\left(\frac{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {initial }}}{[\mathrm{He}]_{\text {final }}}-1\right) \quad(\text { NE 26-10) }
$$

plethysmograph shown in Figure 26-9C has an attached spirometer. As the subject inhales, lung volume and the volume of the subject's body increase by the same amount, displacing an equal volume of air from the plethysmograph into the spirometer, which registers the increase in lung volume $\left(\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$.

As the experiment starts, the shutter is open, and the subject quietly exhales, so that $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is FRC. Because no air is flowing at the end of the expiration, the mouth and alveoli are both at barometric pressure, which is registered by the pressure gauge ( P ). We now close the shutter, and the subject makes a small inspiratory effort, typically only -50 mL , against the closed inlet tube. The subject's inspiratory effort will cause lung volume to increase to a new value, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}+\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (see graph in Fig. 26-9C). However, the number of gas molecules in the airways is unchanged, so this increase in volume must be accompanied by a decrease in airway pressure $(\Delta \mathrm{P})$ to a new value, $\mathrm{P}-\Delta \mathrm{P}$. Because no air is flowing at the peak of this inspiratory effort, the pressure measured by the gauge at the mouth is once again the same as the alveolar pressure. According to Boyle's law,

$$
\frac{\frac{\mathrm{P} \cdot \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{L}}}{\text { Initial }}}{\frac{\mathrm{PV}}{\text { product }}}=\frac{(\mathrm{P}-\Delta \mathrm{P}) \cdot\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}+\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)}{\frac{\mathrm{PV} \text { product }}{\text { at peak of }}}{\text { inspiratory effort }}
$$

Rearranging Equation 26-10 yields the initial lung volume:

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{P}-\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\Delta \mathrm{P}}
$$

As an example, assume that $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ at the peak of the inspiratory effort is 50 mL and that the corresponding pressure decrease in the airways is 12 mm Hg . If the initial pressure $(\mathrm{P})$ was 760 mm Hg ,

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=0.050 \mathrm{~L} \cdot \frac{(760-12) \mathrm{mmHg}}{12 \mathrm{mmHg}}=3.1 \mathrm{~L}
$$

What lung volume or capacity does 3.1 L represent? Because, in our example, the inspiratory effort against the closed shutter began after a quiet expiratory effort, the computed $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is FRC. If it had begun after a maximal expiration, the measured $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would be RV.

# CHAPTER 27 

## MECHANICS OF VENTILATION

Walter F. Boron

The field of pulmonary mechanics-the physics of the lungs, airways, and chest wall-deals with how the body moves air in and out of the lungs, producing a change in lung volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$. When we examine these mechanical properties while no air is flowing, we are studying static properties. The situation becomes more complicated under dynamic conditions, when the lungs are changing volume and air is flowing either in or out.

## STATIC PROPERTIES OF THE LUNG

The balance between the outward elastic recoil of the chest wall and the inward elastic recoil of the lungs generates a subatmospheric intrapleural pressure
The interaction between the lungs and the thoracic cage determines $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. The lungs have a tendency to collapse because of their elastic recoil, a static property represented by the inwardly directed arrows in Figure 27-1A. The chest wall also has an elastic recoil. However, this elastic recoil tends to pull the thoracic cage outward (see Fig. 27-1B). The stage is thus set for an interaction between the lungs and the chest wall: at equilibrium, the inward elastic recoil of the lungs exactly balances the outward elastic recoil of the chest wall (see Fig. 27-1C). This interaction between lungs and chest wall does not occur by direct attachment but via the intrapleural space between the visceral and parietal pleurae (see p. 597). This space is filled with a small amount of pleural fluid and is extremely thin ( 5 to $35 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ). Because the lungs and chest wall pull away from each other on opposite sides of the intrapleural space, the intrapleural pressure ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ ) is less than barometric pressure (PB); that is, the intrapleural space is a relative vacuum. Although the designation $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ implies that we are referring exclusively to the intrapleural space, this description is not entirely accurate. Indeed, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is probably similar to the pressure in several other regions of the chest cavity in addition to the intrapleural space:

1. The virtual space between the chest wall or diaphragm and the parietal pleura
2. The virtual space between the lung and the visceral pleura
3. The interstitial space that surrounds all pulmonary airways
4. Around the heart and vessels
5. Around and-to the extent that smooth-muscle tone can be neglected-inside the esophagus

It is helpful to think of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ as the intrathoracic pressurethe pressure everywhere in the thorax except in the lumens of blood vessels, lymphatics, or airways. ( $\mathbf{N 2 7 - 1}$

The vacuum is not uniform throughout the intrapleural space. When the subject is upright, the vacuum is greatest (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is least) near the apex of the lungs and progressively falls along the longitudinal axis to its lowest value near the bases of the lungs (Fig. 27-2). If a subject whose lungs are $\sim 30 \mathrm{~cm}$ tall has finished a quiet expiration, and if Pb is $760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is $\sim 753 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ near the apices of the lungs and $\sim 758 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ near the bases. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient is about what one would expect, given the density of the lungs. Note that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is subatmospheric throughout the chest cavity. Because respiratory physiologists historically measured these small pressures with water manometers rather than with less sensitive mercury manometers, it has become customary to express $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ in centimeters of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ relative to a Pb of $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is about $-10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at the apex and $-2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at the base of the lungs.

The reasons for the apex-to-base $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient are gravity and posture. When an individual stands vertically on the surface of the earth, gravity pulls the lungs downward and away from the apex of the thoracic cage. This force creates a greater vacuum (i.e., a lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ ) at the apex. Gravity also pushes the bases of the lungs into the thoracic cavity, reducing the vacuum there. Standing on one's head would invert these relationships. Lying on one's side would create a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient along a frontal-horizontal axis (i.e., from side to side), although the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient would be much smaller because the side-to-side dimension of the thorax (and therefore the gradient created by the weight of the lungs) is less than the longitudinal dimension. In outer space, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient would vanish. Thus, the local $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ depends on the position within the gravitational field.

For most of the remainder of this book, we ignore the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient and refer to an average $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of about $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ after a quiet expiration (see Fig. 27-2).

## Contraction of the diaphragm and selected intercostal muscles increases the volume of the thorax, producing an inspiration

We have seen that the opposing elastic recoils of the lungs and chest wall create a negative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ that keeps the lungs expanded. Any change in the balance between these elastic

# N27-1 Measurement of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Measuring $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is intrinsically difficult because the space between the visceral and parietal pleurae is very thin ( 5 to $35 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ). The approaches include use of a pleural needle, pleural catheter, esophageal balloon, pleural balloon, or rib capsule (embedded in a rib) in direct contact with pleural fluid.

Each of these methods reports a vertical gradient in pleural pressure, on the order of $0.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} / \mathrm{cm}$ in head-up dogs. This pressure gradient drives a downward viscous flow of pleural fluid, presumably along the flat surfaces of the ribs. According to a model, recirculation of pleural fluid would be achieved by an upward flow of fluid along the margins of adjacent lobes of the lungs (here the fluid-filled space is larger, which leads to a reduced resistance), energized by movements of the beating heart and ventilating lungs. Finally, a transverse flow of pleural fluid from these margins back to the flat portions of the ribs would complete the circuit.

recoils will cause $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ to change as well. For example, imagine a healthy person with a functional residual capacity (FRC) of 3 L and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. If that person now develops pulmonary fibrosis, which increases the elastic recoil of the lungs, FRC would decrease because a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ would no longer be adequate to keep the resting $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ at 3 L . Moreover, as the lungs shrink, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ would become more negative, causing chest volume to decrease as well. Under normal circumstances, the key elastic recoil is the one we control: the elastic recoil of the chest wall, which we change moment to moment by modulating the tension of the muscles of respiration.

The muscles of inspiration expand the chest, increasing the elastic recoil of the chest wall and making $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ more negative. Despite the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient from the apex to the base of the lungs when no air is flowing at FRC (see Fig. 27-2), the $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ during inspiration is similar throughout the thoracic cavity. Responding to this enhanced intrathoracic vacuum, the lungs expand passively. The increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is virtually the same as the increase in thoracic volume. The muscles that produce a quiet inspiration are called the primary muscles of inspiration and include the diaphragm and many intercostal muscles.

The most important component of the increase in chest volume is the rise in the chest cavity's rostral-caudal diameter, a result of the action of the diaphragm. Stimulated by the phrenic nerves (derived from cervical roots C3 to C5), the diaphragm contracts and moves downward into the abdomen $\sim 1 \mathrm{~cm}$ during quiet ventilation.

The external and internal intercostal muscles, innervated by segmental spinal nerves, span the space between adjacent ribs. The action of each such muscle depends partly on its orientation but especially-because of the shape of the rib cage-on its position along the rostral-caudal axis and around the dorsal-ventral circumference of the rib cage. Thus, not all external intercostals are inspiratory, and not all internal intercostals are expiratory. Inspiratory neurons preferentially stimulate the most rostral and dorsal external intercostals and the parasternal internal intercostals, both of which have inspiratory mechanical advantages. ( $\bigcirc$ N27-2 The contraction of these muscles has two consequences (Fig. 27-3A). First, the rib cage and the tissues between the ribs stiffen and are therefore better able to withstand the increasingly negative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$. Second, thoracic volume increases as (a) ribs 2 through 10 rotate upward and outward, increasing the transverse diameter (bucket-handle effect; see Fig. 27-3B) and (b) the upper ribs rotate the sternum upward and outward, increasing the anterior-posterior diameter (water pump-handle effect).

During a forced inspiration, the accessory (or secondary) muscles of inspiration also come into play:

1. Scalenes. These muscles lift the first two ribs.
2. Sternocleidomastoids. These muscles lift the sternum outward, contributing to the water pump-handle effect.
3. Neck and back muscles. These elevate the pectoral girdle (increasing the cross-sectional area of the thorax) and extend the back (increasing the rostral-caudal length).
4. Upper respiratory tract muscles. The actions of these muscles decrease airway resistance.

## Relaxation of the muscles of inspiration produces a quiet expiration

During a quiet inspiration, normal lungs store enough energy in their elastic recoil to fuel a quiet expiration, just as

stretching of a rubber band stores enough energy to fuel the return to initial length. Thus, a quiet expiration is normally passive, accomplished simply by relaxation of the muscles of inspiration. Thus, there are no primary muscles of expiration.

Expiration is not always entirely passive. One example is a forced expiration in an individual with normal airway resistance. Another is even a quiet expiration of a person with a disease that increases airway resistance (e.g., asthma, chronic bronchitis, emphysema). In either case, the accessory muscles of expiration help make $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ more positive:

1. Abdominal muscles (internal and external oblique, rectoabdominal, and transverse abdominal muscles). Contraction of these muscles (see Fig. 27-3C) increases intra-abdominal pressure and forces the diaphragm upward into the chest cavity, decreasing the rostral-caudal diameter of the thorax and increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$.
2. Intercostals. The most ventral and caudal external intercostals, the most dorsal and lateral of the caudal internal intercostals, and an intercostal-like muscle called the triangularis sterni all have an expiratory mechanical advantage. Expiratory neurons selectively stimulate these muscles so as to reduce both the anterior-posterior and the transverse diameters of the thorax. These actions are particularly important for coughing.
3. Neck and back muscles. Lowering of the pectoral girdle reduces the cross-sectional area of the thorax, whereas flexion of the trunk reduces the rostral-caudal diameter.

During a forced inspiration, the accessory muscles of inspiration use their energy mainly to increase $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (rather than to overcome resistance to airflow); the lungs store this extra energy in their elastic recoil. During a forced expiration, the accessory muscles of expiration use their energy mainly to overcome the resistance to airflow, as discussed below.

## An increase of the static compliance makes it easier to inflate the lungs

Imagine that a person experiences a puncture wound to the chest cavity, so that air enters the thorax from the atmosphere, raising $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ to the same level as P 8 . This condition is called a pneumothorax (from the Greek pneuma [air]). With no vacuum to counter their elastic recoil, alveoli will collapse-a condition known as atelectasis. The upper part of Figure 27-4A illustrates an extreme hypothetical case in which pressure is atmospheric throughout the thorax. Even though the lungs are collapsed, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is not zero because proximal airways collapse before smaller ones farther downstream, trapping air. The resulting minimal air volume is $\sim 10 \%$ of total lung capacity (TLC), typically $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$.

We now wish to re-expand the collapsed lungs to their original volume (i.e., FRC). What are the forces at work during such a re-expansion? The force responsible for distending an airway is the transmural pressure $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}\right)$-the radial pressure difference across an airway wall at any point along the tracheobronchial tree:

![bo22465312c5](bo22465312c5.jpg)

B STATIC PRESSURE-VOLUME DIAGRAM
![bo23465312c5](bo23465312c5.jpg)

Figure 27-4 Collapse and reinflation of the lungs. In $\mathbf{A}$, we assume that $P_{I P}$ rises to $P_{B}$, so that $P_{I P}$ falls to zero, collapsing the lungs.

$$
P_{T M}=P_{A W}-P_{I P}
$$

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is the pressure inside the airway, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is the pressure in the interstitial space surrounding the airway. A special case of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ is the transmural pressure across the alveolar wall-transpulmonary pressure $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)$ :

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}=\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}
$$

PA is alveolar pressure. When the glottis is open and no air is flowing, the lungs are under static conditions, and PA must be $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Static conditions: } \quad \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}=0-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}=-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}} \\
& \text { (glottis open) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, with the glottis open under static conditions, the pressure that inflates the alveoli (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ ) is simply the negative of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$. We can re-expand the lungs to FRC by any combination of an increase in PA and a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$, as long as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ ends up at $5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 27-4A, lower panels). Thus, it makes no difference whether we increase PA from 0 to +5 cm $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ fixed at zero (the principle behind positivepressure ventilation in an intensive care unit) or whether we decrease $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ from 0 to $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ with PA fixed at zero (the principle behind physiological ventilation). In both cases, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases by the same amount.

A clinician would treat the pneumothorax by inserting a chest tube through the wound into the thoracic cavity and gradually pumping out the intrathoracic air. The clinician might also insert a tube through the mouth and into the upper trachea (to ensure a patent airway), use a mechanical ventilator (to ensure gas exchange), and sedate the patient (to prevent the patient from fighting the ventilator). Between the inspiratory cycles of the ventilator, the lungs are under static conditions and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ depends only on $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$-that is, the difference between PA (which is set by the ventilator) and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$. As we remove air from the thorax, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ becomes more negative and the alveoli re-expand. We can characterize the elastic (or static) properties of the lungs by plotting $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ versus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases (see Fig. 27-4B, purple curve). How do we obtain the necessary data? In principle, we could determine $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ by using Equation 26-4. We could read off PA (needed to compute $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ ) directly from the ventilator. Finally, we could in principle measure $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ by using a pressure transducer at the tip of the chest tube. Most important, we must take our readings between inspiratory cycles of the ventilator-under static conditions.

During the reinflation, measured under static conditions, we can divide the effect on $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ into four stages, starting at the left end of the purple curve in Figure 27-4B:

Step 1: Stable $\mathbf{V}_{\mathbf{L}}$. In the lowest range of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ values, making $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ more negative has little or no effect on $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. For example, decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ from 0 to $-1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (i.e., increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ from 0 to $+1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ), we record no change in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. Why? As discussed below, it is very difficult-because of the surface tension created by the air-water interface-to pop open an airway that is completely collapsed. Until $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is large enough to overcome the collapsing effects of surface tension, a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ has no effect on $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$.

Step 2: Opening of airways. Decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ beyond about $-8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ produces $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases that are at first small, reflecting the popping open of proximal airways with the greatest compliance. Further decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ produces larger increases in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, reflecting the expansion of alreadyopen airways as well as recruitment of others.
Step 3: Linear expansion of open airways. After all the airways are already open, making $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ increasingly more negative inflates all airways further, causing $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ to increase in a roughly linear fashion.
Step 4: Limit of airway inflation. As $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ approaches TLC, decreases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ produce ever smaller increases in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, which reflects decreased airway and chest-wall compliance and the limits of muscle strength.

What would happen if, having inflated the lungs to TLC, we allowed $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ to increase to $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ once again? Obviously, the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would decrease. However, the lungs follow a different path during deflation (see Fig. 27-4B, red curve), creating a $\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}-\mathbf{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ loop. The difference between the inflation and the deflation paths-hysteresis-exists because a greater $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is required to open a previously closed airway, owing to a deficit of surfactant at the air-water interface, than to keep an open airway from closing, due to the abundance of surfactant. We will discuss surfactant in the next section. The horizontal dashed line in Figure 27-4B shows that inflating previously collapsed lungs to FRC requires a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $-12 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (purple point), whereas maintaining previously inflated lungs at FRC requires a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ slightly less negative than $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (red point). During normal ventilation, the lungs exhibit much less hysteresis, and the green $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ loop in Figure 27-4B lies close to the red deflation limb of our original loop. The changes in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Figure 27-4B reflect mainly changes in the volume of alveoli, with a small contribution from conducting airways.

We will now focus on just the red curve in Figure 27-4B, a portion of which is the middle curve in Figure 27-5. Here, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ when $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is at FRC. As the subject makes a normal inspiration with a tidal volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$ of $500 \mathrm{~mL}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$
![bo24465312c5](bo24465312c5.jpg)

Figure 27-5 Static pressure-volume curves for healthy and diseased lungs.
increases (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ decreases) by $2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The ratio of $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ to $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ (i.e., the slope of the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve) is the compliance, a measure of the distensibility of the lungs. In our example,

$$
C=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}}{\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}}=\frac{0.5 \mathrm{~L}}{(7.5-5.0) \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=0.2 \frac{\mathrm{~L}}{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}
$$

Because we made this measurement under conditions of zero airflow, $C$ is the static compliance. Static compliance, like $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, is mainly a property of the alveoli. The elastance of the lungs, which is a measure of their elastic recoil, is the reciprocal of the compliance $(E=1 / C)$. Lungs with a high compliance have a low elastic recoil, and vice versa.

Figure 27-5 also shows representative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ relationships for lungs of patients with pulmonary fibrosis (bottom curve) and emphysema (top curve). In pulmonary fibrosis, the disease process causes deposition of fibrous tissue, so that the lung is stiff and difficult to inflate. Patients with restrictive lung disease, by definition, have a decreased $C$ (i.e., a decreased slope of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ relationship in Fig. 27-5) at a given $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. The same $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ that produces a $500-\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increase in normal lungs produces a substantially smaller $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increase in fibrotic lungs. In other words, static compliance $\left(\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)$ is much less, or elastic recoil is much greater.

In emphysema, the situation is reversed. The disease process, a common consequence of cigarette smoking, destroys pulmonary tissue and makes the lungs floppy. An important part of the disease process is the destruction of the extracellular matrix, including elastin, by elastase released from macrophages. Normal mice that are exposed to cigarette smoke develop emphysema rapidly, whereas the disease does not develop in "smoker" mice lacking the macrophage elastase gene. The same increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ that produces a $500-\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increase in normal lungs produces a substantially larger $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increase in lungs with emphysema. In other words, static compliance is much greater (i.e., much less elastic recoil).

Because it requires work to inflate the lungs against their elastic recoil, one might think that a little emphysema might be a good thing. Although it is true that patients with emphysema exert less effort to inflate their lungs, the cigarette smoker pays a terrible price for this small advantage. The destruction of pulmonary architecture also makes emphysematous airways more prone to collapse during expiration, which drastically increases airway resistance.

Two additional points are worth noting. First, compliance (i.e., slope of the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve) decreases as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases from FRC to TLC (see Fig. 27-5). Second, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve is the amalgam of pressure-volume relationships of all alveoli. Different alveoli have different $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curves and may experience different intrapleural pressures, depending on their position within a gravitational field (see Fig. 27-2). This inhomogeneity of static parameters contributes to regional differences in ventilation (see pp. 687-689; Box 27-1).

## Surface tension at the air-water interface of the airways accounts for most of the elastic recoil of the lungs

What is the basis of the elastic recoil that determines the static compliance of the lungs? The elasticity of pulmonary

# BOX 27-1 Restrictive Pulmonary Disease 

Two major categories of pulmonary disease-restrictive and obstructive-can severely reduce total ventilation; that is, the amount of air entering and leaving the lungs per unit of time. We discuss obstructive diseases (which affect the resistance of the conducting airways) in Box 27-2.

Pulmonologists use the term restrictive lung disease in an inclusive sense to refer to any disorder that reduces FRC, vital capacity, or TLC (see Fig. 26-8B) and thereby makes the lungs difficult to inflate. Pure restrictive disease does not affect airway resistance. Restrictive disease can target the lung parenchyma or three extrapulmonary structures, as outlined in the next four paragraphs.

## Lung Parenchyma

Restrictive diseases of the lung parenchyma decrease the static compliance of the lung-mainly a property of the alveoli. To overcome increased elastic recoil, the patient must make extra effort to inhale. The patient compensates by making rapid but shallow inspirations. In newborns, an example is infant respiratory distress syndrome, caused by a deficiency in surfactant. Pulmonary edema is a buildup of fluid in the interstitial space between the alveolar and capillary walls and, eventually, the alveolar space. Interstitial inflammation of a variety of etiologies (e.g., infection, drugs, environmental exposure) can lead to the deposition of fibrous tissue and a group of diseases called diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.

## Pleura

A buildup in the intrapleural space of either air (pneumothorax) or fluid (pleural effusion) can restrict the expansion of a vast number of alveoli.

## Chest Wall

Rigidity of the chest wall makes it difficult to increase thoracic volume even if the neuromuscular system (see next) can generate normal forces. Ankylosing spondylitis is an inflammatory disorder of the axial skeleton that may reduce the bucket-handle rotation of the ribs during quiet inspirations and the flexion and extension of the trunk during forced inspirations and expirations. In kyphoscoliosis (angulation and rotation of the spine), deformation of the vertebrae and ribs may reduce ventilation. In both conditions, impairment of coughing predisposes to lung infections.

## Neuromuscular System

The central nervous system may fail to stimulate the respiratory muscles adequately, or the muscles may fail to respond appropriately to stimulation. In polio, the virus occasionally attacks respiratory control centers in the brainstem (see p. 702). Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig disease) leads to the destruction of premotor and motor neurons, including those to the muscles of respiration (see p. 700). Indeed, dyspnea on exertion is a common early symptom of ALS. Certain drug overdoses (e.g., barbiturate poisoning) may temporarily inhibit respiratory control centers in the brainstem. In the absence of supportive therapy (i.e., mechanical ventilation), the respiratory failure can be fatal. The pain that accompanies surgery or other injuries to the chest can also severely limit the ability to ventilate. Local paralysis of intercostal muscles allows the enhanced intrathoracic vacuum to suck in intercostal tissues during inspiration. This paradoxical movement reduces the efficiency of inspiration. Paradoxical movement may also occur with broken ribs, a condition known as flail chest.
cells and the extracellular matrix (e.g., elastin and collagen), what we might think of as the "anatomical" component of elastic recoil, generally accounts for a small part. The basis of most of the recoil was suggested in 1929 by von Neergaard, who excised lungs from cats and inflated them by applying positive pressure to the trachea under two conditions. When he filled the lungs with air, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve looked similar to the one we have seen before (Fig. 27-6A, blue curve). However, when he degassed the airways and reinflated them with saline, he found that (1) the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ relationship (see Fig. 27-6A, orange curve) exhibited far less hysteresis, and (2) the static compliance was substantially greater (i.e., much less pressure was required to inflate the lungs). These changes occurred because the saline-filled lungs lacked the air-water interface that generated surface tension in the air-filled lungs. It is this surface tension that is responsible for a large fraction of the lung's elastic recoil.

Surface tension is a measure of the force acting to pull a liquid's surface molecules together at an air-liquid interface (see Fig. 27-6B). Water molecules in the bulk liquid phase are equally attracted to surrounding water molecules in all directions, so that the net force acting on these "deep" water molecules is zero. However, water molecules at the surface are equally attracted to others in all directions but "up," where no molecules are available to pull surface water molecules toward the air phase. Thus, a net force pulls surface molecules away from the air-water interface toward the bulk water phase.

We can think of the surface water molecules as beads connected by an elastic band. The force that pulls a water molecule down into the bulk also creates a tension between the molecules that remain at the surface, in a direction that is parallel to the surface. If we try to overcome this tension and stretch the air-water interface (see Fig. 27-6C), thus increasing its area, we must apply force $(\mathcal{F})$ to bring water molecules from the bulk liquid (a low-energy state) to the surface (a high-energy state). If the body of water on which we tug has a length of $l$, then the surface tension $(T)$ is

$$
T=\frac{\mathcal{F}}{l}
$$

For a simple air-water interface at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the surface tension is $\sim 70$ dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$.

A drop of water falling through the air tends to form into a sphere because this shape has the smallest surface area and thus the lowest energy. Put differently, when the drop is spherical, it is impossible for any additional water molecules to leave the surface.

In the reverse scenario, a spherical air bubble surrounded by water (see Fig. 27-6D), unbalanced forces acting on surface water molecules cause them to dive into the bulk, which decreases the surface area and creates tension in the plane of the air-water interface. This surface tension acts like a belt tightening around one's waist. It tends to decrease the volume of compressible gas inside the bubble and increases

its pressure. At equilibrium, the tendency of increased pressure to expand the gas bubble balances the tendency of surface tension to collapse it. The Laplace equation describes this equilibrium: (5)N27-3

$$
P=\frac{2 T}{r}
$$

$P$ is the dependent variable, the surface tension $T$ is a constant for a particular interface, and the bubble radius $r$ is the independent variable. Therefore, the smaller the bubble's radius, the greater the pressure needed to keep the bubble inflated. See pages $455-457$ for a description of how Laplace's treatment applies to blood vessels.

Our bubble-in-water analysis is important for the lung because a thin layer of water covers the inner surface of the alveolus. Just as surface tension at the air-water interface of our gas bubble causes the bubble to constrict, it also causes alveoli and other airways to constrict, contributing greatly to elastic recoil.

The analogy between air bubbles and alveoli breaks down somewhat because an alveolus only approximates a part of a sphere. A second complicating factor is that not all alveoli are the same size; some may have a diameter that is three or four times larger than that of others. Third, alveoli are interconnected.

Figure 27-6E shows what would happen if two imaginary air bubbles in water were connected by a tube with a valve that allows us to make or break the connection between the bubbles. For both, assume that the surface tension $T$ is 70 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$. The valve is initially closed. The first bubble has a radius of 0.010 cm . The second is only half as wide. At equilibrium, the pressure required to keep the smaller bubble inflated is twice that necessary to keep the larger bubble inflated (see calculations in Fig. 27-6E). If we now open the valve between the two bubbles, air will flow from the smaller bubble to the larger bubble. To make matters worse for the smaller bubble, the smaller it becomes, the greater is the pressure needed to stabilize its shrinking radius. Because its pressure is less than required, air continues to flow out of the smaller bubble until it implodes completely.

In principle, the lung faces a similar problem. Smaller alveoli tend to collapse into larger ones. As we shall see, pulmonary surfactant minimizes this collapsing tendency by lowering surface tension. However, even without surfactant, the collapse of small alveoli could proceed only so far because each alveolus is tethered to adjacent alveoli, which help hold it open-the principle of interdependence.

Why would it matter if many smaller alveoli collapsed into a few larger alveoli? Such a collapse would reduce the total alveolar surface area available for diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see p. 661). Thus, from a teleological point of view, it is important for the lung to keep the alveoli as uniformly inflated as possible.

## Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of lipids-mainly dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine-and apoproteins

As noted above, surface tension accounts for most of the elastic recoil in normal lungs. However, if it were not for
pulmonary surfactant, total elastic recoil would be even higher, and the lungs would be far more difficult to inflate. During quiet breathing, surfactant reduces surface tension to $\sim 25$ dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$ or less, far below the value of 70 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$ that exists at a pure air-water interface.

The term surfactant means a surface-active agent. Because surfactants have both a hydrophilic region (strongly attracted to water) and a hydrophobic region (strongly repelled by water), they localize to the surface of an air-water interface. An example of a synthetic surfactant is dishwashing detergent. As a younger student, you may have done a simple experiment in which you filled a small-diameter cup with water and carefully floated a thin sewing needle-lengthwise-on the surface. The needle, like an insect that walks on water, is supported by surface tension, which pulls in the plane of the air-water interface. When you add a drop of liquid detergent to the surface of the water, the needle instantly sinks. Why? The detergent greatly reduces the surface tension.

Detergent molecules orient themselves so that their hydrophilic heads point toward (and interact with) the most superficial water molecules, whereas the hydrophobic tails point toward the air (Fig. 27-7). The hydrophilic surfactant heads pull strongly upward on the most superficial water molecules, greatly reducing the net force on these surface water molecules and minimizing their tendency to dive into the bulk water. What prevents surfactant at the air-surfactant interface from diving into the bulk water? The hydrophobic tails exert a counterforce, pulling the surfactant upward toward the air. The situation is not unlike that of a fishing line with a bobber at one end and a sinker at the other: as long as the bobber is sufficiently buoyant, it remains at the water's surface. Thus, unlike surface water molecules, which are subjected to a large net force pulling them into the bulk, surfactant experiences a much smaller net force. The greater the surface density of surfactant molecules at the air-water interface (i.e., the smaller the surface occupied by water molecules), the smaller the surface tension.

Pulmonary surfactant is a complex mixture of lipids and proteins. Type II alveolar cells (see p. 599), cuboidal epithelial cells that coexist with the much thinner type I cells, synthesize and secrete pulmonary surfactant. Clara cells in

Imagine a soap bubble that is perfectly spherical. At equilibrium, the tendency of the transmural pressure $(P)$ to expand the bubble exactly balances the tendency of the surface tension $(T)$ to collapse the bubble. An infinitesimally small change in the radius of the sphere (dr) would produce infinitesimally small changes in both the area of the sphere $(d A)$ and the volume of the sphere $(d V)$. The infinitesimally small amount of pressure $\times$ volume work done in expanding the volume would equal the tension $\times$ area work done in expanding the surface area:

Because the volume of a sphere is $(4 / 3) \pi r^{3}$,

$$
d V=d\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}\right)=4 \pi r^{2} d r
$$

Similarly, the area of a sphere is $4 \pi r^{2}$. Thus,

$$
d A=d \underbrace{(4 \pi r^{2})}_{\text {Volume }}=8 \pi r d r
$$

Substituting the expressions for $d V$ (see Equation NE 27-2) and $d A$ (see Equation NE 27-3) into Equation NE 27-1, we have

$$
P d V=P\left(4 \pi r^{2} d r\right)=T(8 \pi r d r)=T d A
$$

Rearranging and solving for $P$, we have

$$
P=\frac{2 T}{r}
$$

In our example of a soap bubble-and also in the hypothetical example of a perfectly spherical alveolus $-T$ is a constant, $r$ is the independent variable, and $P$ is the dependent variable. Thus, a sphere with a smaller radius must have a larger transmural pressure to remain in equilibrium.

The article by Prange discusses the limitations in applying Laplace's law to alveoli. As noted in the text on page 613, the alveoli are neither perfect spheres nor uniform spheres. Moreover, their interiors are interconnected, and individual alveoli often share walls with their adjacent neighbors (principle of interdependence).

the respiratory bronchioles manufacture at least some components of pulmonary surfactant. Lipids make up $\sim 90 \%$ of surfactant and are responsible for the surface-active properties. About half of the lipid is dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC). Figure 27-8 shows the synthesis and structure of DPPC (also known as dipalmitoyl lecithin), which contains two fully saturated 16-carbon fatty-acid chains (i.e., palmitates). The second most common lipids in pulmonary surfactant are phosphatidylcholine molecules with unsaturated fatty-acid chains. Compared with cell membranes, phosphatidylglycerol ( $\sim 11 \%$ of lipid) is overrepresented in surfactant.

Proteins account for the remaining $\sim 10 \%$ of pulmonary surfactant. Plasma proteins (mainly albumin) and secretory immunoglobulin A make up about half of the protein, and four apoproteins (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, and SP-D) make up the rest. SP-A and SP-D are water soluble and have collagen-like domains (Table 27-1). Both contribute to "innate immunity" by acting as opsonins to coat bacteria and viruses, thereby promoting phagocytosis by macrophages resident in the alveoli. In addition, SP-A $\bigcirc$ N27-4 may be important for feedback control that limits surfactant secretion. The two hydrophobic apoproteins, SP-B and SP-C, are intrinsic membrane proteins that greatly increase the rate at which surfactant enters the air-water interface and then spreads as a surface film. The hereditary absence of SP-B leads to respiratory distress that is fatal unless the newborn receives a lung transplant.

The lipid components of pulmonary surfactant enter type II cells from the bloodstream (Fig. 27-9A). Type II cells use the secretory pathway (see pp. 34-35) to synthesize the four apoproteins, all of which undergo substantial posttranslational modification. The final assembly of surfactant occurs in lamellar bodies, which are $\sim 1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter and consist of concentric layers of lipid and protein (see Fig. 27-9B). Some of the material in these lamellar bodies represents newly synthesized components, and some of it represents recycled surfactant components retrieved from the alveolar surface. Each hour, the normal lung secretes into

## N27-12 DPPC Synthesis near Birth

Contributed by Ervin Jones and Walter Boron<br>Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC)—also known as dipalmitoyl lecithin-is the major component of pulmonary surfactant. As outlined in Figure 27-8, the condensation of diacylglycerol with cytosine diphosphate choline ultimately leads to the production of DPPC. In the fetus, shortly before birth, an increase in plasma cortisol levels upregulates several enzymes that are important for the synthesis of DPPC, including fatty-acid synthase and phosphocholine transferase.

the alveolar space $\sim 10 \%$ of the material present in the lamellar bodies.

The secretion of pulmonary surfactant occurs by constitutive exocytosis (see p. 35). In the fetus, both synthesis and secretion are quite low until immediately before birth, when a surge in maternal glucocorticoid levels triggers these processes (see p. 1156). Infants born prematurely may thus lack sufficient levels of surfactant and may develop infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS; see p. 1156). In postnatal life, several stimuli enhance the surfactant secretion, including hyperinflation of the lungs (e.g., sighing and yawning), exercise, and pharmacological agents (e.g., $\beta$-adrenergic agonists, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ionophores).

After its secretion into the thin layer of water that covers the alveolar epithelium, freed from the physical constraints of confinement to a lamellar body, pulmonary surfactant undergoes major structural changes. In this aqueous layer, surfactant takes on the form of a meshwork known as tubular myelin (see Fig. 27-9B), which is rich in surfactant apoproteins. It is not clear whether surfactant normally passes through the tubular-myelin state before forming a surface film at the air-water interface. However, tubular myelin is not required; SP-A knockout mice lack tubular myelin but have a normal surface film.

Two mechanisms remove components of pulmonary surfactant from the surface of alveoli. Alveolar macrophages degrade some of the surfactant. Type II cells take up the rest, and either recycle or destroy it.

## Pulmonary surfactant reduces surface tension and increases compliance

The pulmonary surfactant present at the alveolar air-water interface has three major effects.

First, because surfactant reduces surface tension, it increases compliance, making it far easier to inflate the lungs. If surfactant suddenly disappeared from the lungs, mimicking the situation in IRDS, total elastic recoil would increase (i.e., compliance would decrease) twofold or more, causing small airways to collapse partially. The situation would be similar to that described by the fibrosis curve in Figure 27-5. Because the compliance of the lungs is far lower than normal, an infant with IRDS-compared with a normal infant-must produce far larger changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ (or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ ) to achieve the same increase in $\mathrm{V}_{1}$. Therefore, infants with low surfactant levels must expend tremendous effort to contract their inspiratory muscles and expand the lungs.

Second, by reducing surface tension, surfactant minimizes fluid accumulation in the alveolus. In the absence of surfactant, the large surface tension of the liquid layer between the air and the alveolar type I cells would cause the "air bubble" to collapse, drawing fluid into the alveolar space from the interstitium. The net effect would be to increase the thickness of the liquid layer and thereby impair gas diffusion. With normal levels of surfactant, the surface tension of the water layer is low, and the tendency to draw fluid from the interstitium to the alveolar space is balanced by the negative

Figure 27-10 Braking action of surfactant on inflation.
interstitial hydrostatic pressure (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{iP}}$ ), which favors fluid movement from the alveolar space into the interstitium.

Third, surfactant helps keep alveolar size relatively uniform during the respiratory cycle. Imagine that we startafter a quiet expiration-with two alveoli having the same radius (e.g., $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) and the same surface density of surfactant (to yield a surface tension of 20 dynes $/ \mathrm{cm}$ ), as indicated by the inner dashed circles of the two alveoli in Figure 27-10. However, either the conducting airway leading to the lower alveolus has a higher resistance or the lower alveolus itself has more fibrous tissue. Either way, the lower alveolus inflates more slowly during inspiration and-at any time-has a smaller volume than the upper one. This size difference has two negative consequences: (1) The total surface area of the two alveoli is less than if they had inflated equally, which impairs gas diffusion. (2) Because the final volume increase of the upper alveolus may be greater than that of the lower one, its ventilation may be greater. Such unevenness of ventilation impairs effective gas exchange (see p. 693).

Fortunately, surfactant helps alveoli dynamically adjust their rates of inflation and deflation, so that ventilation is more uniform among alveoli. During rapid inflation, the alveolar surface expands more rapidly than additional surfactant can reach the surface from a surfactant pool beneath the surface. Thus, surfactant on the surface is thought to break up like a flow of ice on the sea, with open areas of pure water between clusters of surfactant. With more exposed water at the surface, surface tension increases. Surface tension may double during inspiration, compared with the resting value at FRC. This effect would be exaggerated in
rapidly expanding alveoli, which would develop a higher surface tension more quickly than slowly expanding alveoli. This higher surface tension produces a greater elastic recoil that opposes further expansion. Thus, the dilution of surfactant tends to put more of a brake on rapidly expanding airways, slowing their expansion to more nearly match that of alveoli that tend to inflate more slowly. (5) N27-5

The opposite appears to happen during expiration, when the surface area of rapidly contracting alveoli falls more rapidly than surfactant can dive back down into the subsurface pool. The compression of surfactant causes surface tension to fall precipitously. Surface tension during expiration may fall to half the resting value at FRC. The more rapidly an alveolus shrinks, the more quickly its surface tension falls, the lower is its elastic recoil, and the greater is its tendency to re-expand. This action puts a brake on rapidly contracting alveoli, slowing their rate of shrinkage to more closely match that of slowly contracting alveoli. These changes in surfactant contribute to the small amount of hysteresis in a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{iP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ loop during quiet breathing (green loop in Fig. 27-4B).

## DYNAMIC PROPERTIES OF THE LUNG

When air is flowing-that is, under dynamic conditionsone must not only exert the force necessary to maintain the lung and chest wall at a certain volume (i.e., static component of force), but also exert an extra force to overcome the inertia and resistance of the tissues and air molecules (i.e., dynamic component of force).

## Airflow is proportional to the difference between alveolar and atmospheric pressure, but inversely proportional to airway resistance

The flow of air through tubes is governed by the same principles governing the flow of blood through blood vessels and the flow of electrical current through wires (see Equation 17-1). Airflow is proportional to driving pressure ( $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ ) but inversely proportional to total airway resistance $\left(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}\right)$ :

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}}=\frac{\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{PB}}{\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}}
$$

$\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ (units: $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s}$ ) is airflow; the dot above the V indicates the time derivative of volume. For the lung, the driving pressure is the difference between alveolar pressure ( PA ) and barometric pressure (PB). Thus, for a fixed resistance, more airflow requires a greater $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ (i.e., more effort). Viewed differently, to achieve a desired airflow, a greater resistance requires a greater $\Delta \mathrm{P}$.

When airflow is laminar-that is, when air molecules move smoothly in the same direction-we can apply Poiseuille's law, which states that the resistance (R) of a tube is proportional to the viscosity of the gas $(\eta)$ and length of the tube (l) but inversely proportional to the fourth power of the radius:

$$
\mathrm{R}=\frac{8}{\pi} \frac{\eta l}{r^{4}}
$$

# N27-5 Role of Surfactant in the "Static" Pressure-Volume Loop 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The classic static pressure-volume loop exhibits considerable hysteresis (see large loop formed by purple and red curves in Fig. 27-4). This hysteresis is due in large part to the movement of surfactant into the air-water interface as the lung inflates from RV to TLC, and to the movement of surfactant out of the air-water interface as the lung deflates from TLC to RV.

During normal, quiet breathing, the pressure-volume loop (see small green loop in Fig. 27-4B) lies near the deflation limb (red in Fig. 27-4B) of the "classic" loop. The quiet-breathing loop differs from the classic loop in three respects. First, the green quiet-breathing loop covers a much smaller range of pressures and volumes. Second, the green quiet-breathing loop exhibits very little hysteresis because relatively less surfactant moves into the air-water interface during inspiration and out of the air-water interface during expiration at these small $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ values. Third, at comparable lung volumes, the average compliance in the quiet-breathing loop (i.e., the slope of a line drawn between the two ends of the loop) is less than the static compliance of the classic loop's deflation limb. Again, this difference arises because during quiet breathing, less surfactant is present at the air-water interface, causing the lungs to be stiffer.

During quiet breathing, the pool of surfactant available to move into and out of the air-water interface with each $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ gradually decreases as the result of the catabolism of surfactant (see Fig. 27-9). As a result, the lungs gradually stiffen. In other words, the fall in compliance makes the lungs more difficult to inflate. In fact, some alveoli collapse, a condition termed atelectasis. This collapse is particularly prevalent in dependent regions of the lungs (e.g., the base of the lung in an upright individual), which reflects the relatively less negative $P_{i \mathrm{r}}$ near the base of the lung (see Fig 27-2) and thus the smaller degree of inflation. Fortunately, stretch receptors in the lung sense this atelectasis and trigger a large inspiratory effort to TLC-a sigh or a yawn (see Box 32-4). Sighing and, even more so, yawning are powerful stimuli for trafficking surfactant to the air-water interface, increasing compliance and reversing the atelectasis.

This equation is the same as Equation 17-11 for laminar blood flow. In general, changes in viscosity and length are not very important for the lung, although the resistance while breathing helium is greater than that while breathing nitrogen, the major component of air, because helium has a greater viscosity. However, the key aspect of Equation 27-8 is that airflow is extraordinarily sensitive to changes in airway radius. The fourth-power dependence of R on radius means that a $10 \%$ decrease in radius causes a $52 \%$ increase in R-that is, a $34 \%$ decrease in airflow. Although Poiseuille's law strictly applies only to laminar flow conditions, as discussed below, airflow is even more sensitive to changes in radius when airflow is not laminar.

In principle, it is possible to compute the total airway resistance of the tracheobronchial tree from anatomical measurements, applying Poiseuille's law when the flow is laminar and analogous expressions for airways in which the flow is not laminar. In 1915, Rohrer used this approach, along with painstaking measurements of the lengths and diameters of the airways of an autopsy specimen, to calculate the $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ of the tracheobronchial tree. However, it is not practical to compute $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ values, especially if we are interested in physiological or pathological changes in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$. Therefore, for both physiologists and physicians, it is important to measure $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ directly. Rearrangement of Equation 27-7 yields an expression from which we can compute $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$, provided that we know the driving pressure and the airflow that it produces:

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}=\frac{\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{PB}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}\left(\text { units: } \frac{\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}{\mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}}\right)
$$

We can measure airflow directly with a flowmeter (pneumotachometer) built into a tube through which the subject breathes. Measuring the driving pressure is more problematic because of the difficulty in measuring PA during breathing. In 1956, DuBois and colleagues met this challenge by cleverly using Boyle's law (5) N25-8 and a plethysmograph to measure PA (Fig. 27-11). For example, if the peak $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ during a quiet inspiration is $-0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$ (by convention, a negative value denotes inflow) and PA at the same instant is $-1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (from the plethysmograph), then

$$
\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}=\frac{\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{PB}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}}=\frac{-1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}{-0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}}=2 \frac{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}{\mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}}
$$

In normal individuals, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$ but can range from 0.6 to 2.3. Resistance values are higher in patients with respiratory disease and can exceed $10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$ in extreme cases.

The resistance that we measure in this way is the airway resistance, which represents $\sim 80 \%$ of total pulmonary resistance. The remaining $20 \%$ represents tissue resistancethat is, the friction of pulmonary and thoracic tissues as they slide past one another as the lungs expand or contract.

## In the lung, airflow is transitional in most of the tracheobronchial tree

We have seen that laminar airflow is governed by a relationship that is similar to Ohm's law. What happens when the airflow is not laminar? And can we predict whether the
airflow is likely to be laminar? The flow of a fluid down a tube is laminar when particles passing any particular point always have the same speed and direction. Because of their viscosity, real fluids move fastest down the midline of the tube, and velocity falls to zero as we approach the wall of the tube (Fig. 27-12A), as discussed for blood on page 416. If the average velocity of the fluid flowing down the tube passes a critical value, flow becomes turbulent; local irregular currents, called vortices, develop randomly, and they greatly increase resistance to flow. Under ideal laboratory conditions, airflow generally is laminar when the dimensionless Reynolds number (Re) is $<2000$ (see p. 416):

$$
R e=\frac{2 r \bar{v} \rho}{\eta}
$$

Here $r$ is the radius of the tube, $\bar{v}$ is the velocity of the gas averaged over the cross section of the tube, $\rho$ is the density of the gas, and $\eta$ is its viscosity. When Re exceeds $\sim 3000$, flow tends to be turbulent. Between Re values of 2000 and 3000, flow is unstable and may switch between laminar and turbulent.

Reynolds developed Equation 27-11 to predict turbulence when fluids flow through tubes that are long, straight, smooth, and unbranched. Pulmonary airways, however, are short, curved, bumpy, and bifurcated. The branches are especially problematic, because they set up small eddies (see Fig. 27-12B). Although these eddies resolve farther along the airways, the air soon encounters yet other bifurcations, which establish new eddies. This sort of airflow is termed transitional. Because of the complex geometry of pulmonary airways, the critical $R e$ in the lungs is far lower than the ideal value of 2000 . In fact, Re must be less than -1 for lung airflow to be laminar. Such low Re values and thus laminar flow are present only in the small airways that are distal to terminal bronchioles (see p. 597).

Airflow is transitional throughout most of the tracheobronchial tree. Only in the trachea, where the airway radius is large and linear air velocities may be extremely high (e.g., during exercise, coughing), is airflow truly turbulent (see Fig. 27-12C).

The distinction among laminar, transitional, and turbulent airflow is important because these patterns influence how much energy one must invest to produce airflow. When flow is laminar (see Equation 27-7), airflow is proportional to $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ and requires relatively little energy. When flow is transitional, one must apply more $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ to produce the same airflow because producing vortices requires extra energy. Thus, the "effective resistance" increases. When flow is turbulent, airflow is proportional not to $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ but to $\sqrt{\Delta \mathrm{P}}$. Thus, we must apply an even greater $\Delta \mathrm{P}$ to achieve a given flow (i.e., effective resistance is even greater).

## The smallest airways contribute only slightly to total airway resistance in healthy lungs

As discussed above, airway resistance for healthy individuals is $\sim 1.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$. Because effective resistance can increase markedly with increases in airflow-owing to transitional and turbulent airflow-it is customary to measure resistances at a fixed, relatively low flow of $\sim 0.5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$.

Figure 27-11 Measurement of PA during airflow. This plethysmograph is similar to the one in Figure 26-9 except that the spirometer is replaced by a sensitive device for measurement of the pressure inside the plethysmograph $\left(P_{\text {low }}\right)$. The subject breathes plethysmograph air through a tube that has an electronically controlled shutter as well as meters for measurement of airflow and pressure at the mouth. In $\mathbf{B}$, with the subject making an inspiratory effort against a closed shutter, pressure at the mouth equals PA. We obtain the calibration ratio $\Delta \mathrm{PA} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {low }}$, which allows us to convert future changes in the $\mathrm{P}_{\text {low }}$ to changes in PA. In C, the subject inspires through an open shutter. During the first moments of inspiration, the thorax expands before much air enters the lungs. Because alveoli expand without much of an increase in the number of gas molecules, PA must fall. Conversely, because the thorax encroaches on the plethysmograph air, which has hardly lost any gas molecules to the lungs, $\mathrm{P}_{\text {low }}$ must rise. From the calibration ratio $\Delta \mathrm{PA} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {low }}$, we calculate $\Delta \mathrm{PA}$ from $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {low }}$ during inspiration. PA at any point during the respiratory cycle is the sum of the known Ps and the measured $\Delta \mathrm{PA}$.

A striking feature is that the greatest aggregate resistance is in the pharynx-larynx and large airways (diameter $>2 \mathrm{~mm}$, or before about generation 8 ). Of the $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ of

## BOX 27-2 Obstructive Pulmonary Disease

Two major categories of pulmonary disease can markedly reduce total ventilation: the restrictive pulmonary diseases (see Box 27-1) and the obstructive pulmonary diseases, in which the pathological process causes an increase in airway resistance-primarily a property of the conducting airways (see p. 597).

The condition can be acute, as with the aspiration of a foreign body, the buildup of mucus in an airway lumen, or the constriction of the airway lumen due to the contraction of smooth muscle in asthma (see Box 27-3).

COPD is defined as an increase in airway resistance caused by chronic bronchitis (long-standing inflammation of the bronchi or bronchioles), emphysema (destruction of alveolar walls, producing a smaller number of large alveoli), or a combination of the two. In the United States, COPD is the fourth leading cause of death. The major risk factor is cigarette smoking, although the inherited absence of $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin (see Table 18-1) also predisposes to COPD. Inflammation leads to the infiltration of the walls of conducting airways by macrophages, activated T lymphocytes, and neutrophils as well as the infiltration of alveolar walls by activated lymphocytes. The release of neutrophil elastase and other proteases overwhelms natural antiproteases, such as $\alpha_{1}$-antitrypsin. Bronchitis increases airway resistance by narrowing the lumen. With its destruction of alveolar walls, emphysema increases the static compliance, which, by itself, would make it easier to inhale. However, the destruction of parenchyma also reduces the mechanical tethering (see p. 620) of conducting airways, leading to an exaggerated collapse of these airways during expiration (see p. 626) and thus to an increase in airway resistance.
$1.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$ in a normal subject, 0.6 is in the upper air passages, 0.6 is in the large airways, and only 0.3 is in the small airways.

Because $R$ increases with the fourth power of airway radius (see Equation 27-8), it might seem counterintuitive that the small airways have the lowest aggregate resistance. However, although each small airway has a high individual resistance, so many are aligned in parallel that their aggregate resistance is very low. N27-6 We see this same pattern of resistance in the vascular system, where capillaries make a smaller contribution than arterioles to aggregate resistance.

Table 27-2 also shows how $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ varies for a typical patient with moderately severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a condition in which emphysema or chronic bronchitis increases $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ (Box 27-2). COPD is a common and debilitating consequence of cigarette smoking, far more common than the lung cancer that receives so much attention in the lay press. Notice where the disease strikes. Even though COPD increases total airway resistance to $5.0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})-3.3$-fold greater than in our normal subject-pharynx-larynx resistance does not change at all, and large-airway resistance increases only modestly. Almost all of the increment in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is due to a nearly 12 -fold increase in the resistance of the smallest airways! According to Equation 27-8, we could produce a 12 -fold increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ by decreasing radius by about half.

# N27-6 Aggregate Resistance of Small Airways 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the text we point out that, although each small airway has a high individual resistance compared to each large airway, there are so many of these small airways aligned in parallel that their aggregate resistance is very low.

In Chapter 17, we introduce the concept of how to compute the aggregate resistance of a group of blood vessels (or resistors) arranged in parallel. We used Equation 17-3, which we reproduce here:

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{1}}+\frac{1}{R_{2}}+\frac{1}{R_{3}}+\ldots
$$

If we assume that each of $N$ parallel branches has the same resistance $R_{i}$ (i.e., $R_{i}=R_{1}=R_{2}=R_{3}=R_{4}=\ldots$ ), then the overall resistance is

$$
\frac{1}{R_{\text {total }}}=\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\frac{1}{R_{i}}+\frac{1}{R_{j}}+\ldots=\frac{N}{R_{i}}
$$

Thus,

$$
R_{\text {total }}=\frac{R_{i}}{N}
$$

As an example, let us compare the aggregate resistance at generations 10 and 16. At generation 10, the airway diameter may be $\sim 1.2 \mathrm{~mm}(r=0.6 \mathrm{~mm})$, whereas at generation 16 , the diameter might be $0.6 \mathrm{~mm}(r=0.3 \mathrm{~mm})$. Because the radius has fallen by a factor of 2 between generations 10 and 16, the fourth-power relationship between radius and resistance (see Equation 27-8) tells us that the unitary resistance of each airway must increase by a factor of 16. However, there are $2^{8}$-fold more airways at generation 16 than at generation 10. Thus, if we make the simplifying assumption that the airway length is the same for the two generations, we would conclude that the aggregate resistance falls to 16/64 or $25 \%$ of the initial value as we move from generation 10 to generation 16 .

## BOX 27-3 Asthma

Asthma is a very common condition, occurring in $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the American population. Asthma is primarily an inflammatory disorder; the familiar bronchospasm is secondary to the underlying inflammation. One hypothesis is that asthma represents the inappropriate activation of immune responses designed to combat parasites in the airways. When a susceptible person inhales a trigger (e.g., pollen), inflammatory cells rush into the airways, releasing a multitude of cytokines, leukotrienes, and other humoral substances (e.g., histamine) that induce bronchospasm.

The patient experiencing an acute asthma attack is usually easy to recognize. The classic presentation includes shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Triggers include allergens, heat or cold, a host of occupational irritants, and exercise. The patient can often identify the specific trigger. Spirometry can confirm the diagnosis; the most characteristic feature is a decreased $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$. Many asthmatic patients use peak flowmeters at home because the severity of symptoms does not always correlate with objective measurements of the disease's severity.

The type of treatment depends on the frequency and severity of the attacks. For patients with infrequent attacks that are not particularly severe, it is often possible to manage the disease with an inhaled $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic agonist, used only when needed. These medications, easily delivered by a metered-dose inhaler that can be carried around in one's pocket or purse, act on $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptors to oppose bronchoconstriction. A patient who requires such an agent more than one or two times a week should receive an inhaled corticosteroid on a regular basis to suppress inflammation. Inhaled corticosteroids generally lack the side effects of oral corticosteroids, but oral corticosteroids may be required in a patient with sustained and severe asthma. Many patients rely on regular dosing of long-acting $\beta$-agonist inhalers and inhaled corticosteroids to keep their asthma under control. Theophylline (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor that raises [cAMP]), see p. 51), once a mainstay of asthma therapy, is now used far less commonly. Inhaled anticholinergic agents are more useful in COPD patients than in asthmatic patients but can be beneficial in some individuals who cannot tolerate the side effects of $\beta$-adrenergic agonists (notably tachycardial. Smooth-muscle relaxants (e.g., cromakalim-related drugs; see p. 198) and other anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., leukotriene inhibitors) also play a role in asthma therapy.

Although small airways normally have a very low aggregate resistance, it is within these small airways that COPD has its greatest and earliest effects. Even a doubling of smallairway resistance from 0.3 to $0.6 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$ in the early stages of COPD would produce such a small increment in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ that it would be impossible to identify the COPD patient in a screening test based on resistance measurements. As discussed on pages 687-689, approaches that detect the nonuniformity of ventilation are more sensitive for detection of early airway disease. In addition to COPD, the other common cause of increased $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is asthma (Box 27-3).

Regardless of its cause, increased $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ greatly increases the energy required to move air into and out of the lungs. If the increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is severe enough, it can markedly limit
exercise. In extreme cases, even walking may be more exercise than the patient can manage. The reason is obvious from the pulmonary version of Ohm's law (see Equation 27-7). The maximal $\Delta \mathrm{P}\left(\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\max }\right)$ that we can generate between atmosphere and alveoli during inspiration, for example, depends on how low we can drive alveolar pressure using our muscles of inspiration. For a given $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\max }$, a 3.3 -fold increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ (COPD column in Table 27-2) translates to a 3.3 -fold reduction in maximal airflow $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\max }\right) . \quad$ N27-7

## Vagal tone, histamine, and reduced lung volume all increase airway resistance

Several factors can modulate $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$, including the autonomic nervous system (ANS), humoral factors, and changes in the volume of the lungs themselves. The vagus nerve, part of the parasympathetic division of the ANS, releases acetylcholine, which acts on an $\mathrm{M}_{3}$ muscarinic receptor on bronchial smooth muscle (see p. 341). The result is bronchoconstriction and therefore an increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$. The muscarinic antagonist atropine blocks this action. Irritants such as cigarette smoke cause a reflex bronchoconstriction (see pp. 717-718) in which the vagus nerve is the efferent limb.

Opposing the action of the vagus nerve is the sympathetic division of the ANS, which releases norepinephrine and dilates the bronchi and bronchioles, but reduces glandular secretions. However, these effects are weak because norepinephrine is a poor agonist of the $\beta_{2}$-adrenergic receptors that mediate this effect via cAMP (see pp. 342-343).

Humoral factors include epinephrine, released by the adrenal medulla. Circulating epinephrine is a far better $\beta_{2}$ agonist than is norepinephrine and therefore a more potent bronchodilator. Histamine constricts bronchioles and alveolar ducts and thus increases $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$. Far more potent is the bronchoconstrictor effect of the leukotrienes $\mathrm{LTC}_{4}$ and $\mathrm{LTD}_{4}$.

One of the most powerful determinants of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is lung volume. $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is extremely high at residual volume (RV) but decreases steeply as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases (Fig. 27-13A). One reason for this effect is obvious: all pulmonary airways-including the conducting airways, which account for virtually all of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$-expand at high $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, and resistance falls steeply as radius increases (see Equation 27-8). A second reason is the principle of interdependence (see p. 613)-alveoli tend to hold open their neighbors by exerting radial traction or mechanical tethering (see Fig. 27-13B). This principle is especially important for conducting airways, which have thicker walls than alveoli and thus a lower compliance. At high $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, alveoli dilate more than the adjacent bronchioles, pulling the bronchioles farther open by mechanical tethering. Patients with obstructive lung disease, by definition, have an increased $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ at a given $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (see Fig. 27-13A). However, because these patients tend to have a higher-than-normal FRC, they breathe at a higher $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, where airway resistance is-for them-relatively low.

## Intrapleural pressure has a static component $\left(-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)$ that determines lung volume and a dynamic component (PA) that determines airflow

In Equation 27-2, we defined transpulmonary pressure as the difference between alveolar and intrapleural pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}=\right.$

# N27-7 Effect of Increased Airway Resistance on Maximal Airflow 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Beginning on page 619 of the text, we presented an example in which COPD increased airway resistance $\left(R_{\text {cor }}\right)$ by a factor of 3.3 (from 1.5 to 5.0 respiratory resistance units of $\mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /$ [L/s]; see Table 27-2). If the maximal $\Delta P$ that the subject can generate between atmosphere and alveoli ( $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\text {max }}$ ) were to remain normal, then the maximal airflow ( $\dot{V}_{\text {max }}$; units: L/s) would also decrease by a factor of 3.3 :

$$
\dot{V}_{\max }=\frac{P A_{\text {cor }}}{R_{\text {cor }}} \quad(\text { NE 27-9) }
$$

Although the relationship between $\dot{V}_{\text {max }}$ and the maximal amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ taken up per minute ( $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { max }}$; see pp. 1213-1214) is not directly proportional, it is intuitively obvious that as $\dot{V}_{\text {max }}$ falls, $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { max }}$ must also fall ... and with it, the maximal amount of exercise that the individual can perform. Thus, if a healthy individual-running with maximal effort-were capable of jogging a kilometer in, say, 5 minutes, then a COPD patient might at best be able to walk that distance over a much longer time. With further increases in $R_{\text {min }}$, the maximal exercise capacity of the COPD patient would gradually decline, and with sufficiently severe disease, the patient might have difficulty even walking along a perfectly flat surface without aid of supplemental oxygen.

Figure 27-14 Static and dynamic components of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$.
$\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ ). What is the physiological significance of these three pressures, and how do we control them?
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is the parameter that the brain-through the muscles of respiration-directly controls. Rearranging the definition of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ in Equation 27-2 yields

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}=\left(-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)+\mathrm{PA}
$$

Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ has two components, $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ and PA , as summarized in Figure 27-14 and Table 27-3. As we will see in the next section, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ and PA literally flow from $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$.

Transpulmonary Pressure $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is a static parameter. It does not cause airflow. Rather, along with static compliance, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ determines $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. The curve in the lower left part of Figure 27-14-like the middle plot of Figure 27-5-describes how

TABLE 27-3 Static Versus Dynamic Properties of the Lungs

| PROPERTY | STATIC | DYNAMIC |
| :--: | :--: | :--: |
| Anatomical correlate | Alveoli | Conducting airways |
| Key "constant" | Static compliance, C | Airway resistance, $\mathrm{R}_{\text {avv }}$ |
| Key pressure | $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}=\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}\right)$ | PA |
| Key parameter | $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\left(\mathrm{C}=\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}} / \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)$ | $\dot{\mathrm{V}}\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}=\mathrm{PA} / \mathrm{R}_{\text {avv }}\right)$ |
| Pathology | Restrictive disease (e.g., fibrosis), caused by $\downarrow \mathrm{C}$ | Obstructive disease (e.g., COPD), caused by $\uparrow \mathrm{R}_{\text {avv }}$ |

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ depends on $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$. That is, this curve describes the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ required to overcome the elastic (i.e., static) forces that oppose lung expansion but makes no statement about $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$. We have already seen that the slope of this curve is static compliance (see p. 610), a property mainly of the alveoli, and that a decrease in C can produce restrictive lung disease (see p. 610). Note that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ not only determines $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ under static conditions, when there is no airflow, but also under dynamic conditions (i.e., during inspiration and expiration). However, the brain does not directly control $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$.

Alveolar Pressure PA is a dynamic parameter. It does not determine $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ directly. Instead, along with airway resistance, PA determines airflow. The curve in the lower right part of Figure 27-14 describes how $\dot{V}$ depends on PA. That is, this curve describes the PA required to overcome inertial and resistive (i.e., dynamic) forces that oppose airflow but makes no statement about $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. The slope of this plot is airway conductance, the reciprocal of $\mathrm{R}_{\text {avv }} \bigcirc$ N27-8 which is mainly a property of the conducting airways. An increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\text {avv }}$ can produce obstructive lung disease. When PA is zero, $\dot{V}$ must be zero, regardless of whether $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is at RV or TLC or anywhere in between. If the PA is positive and the glottis is open, air flows from alveoli to atmosphere, regardless of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. If PA

# N27-8 Airway Resistance 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In the lower right panel of Figure 27-14, we have assumed that airway resistance $\left(R_{a w}\right)$ is constant during a respiratory cycle, so that the $\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{V}$ curve is a straight line. However, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{aw}}$ changes with lung volume (see red and teal curves in Fig. 27-13.4) and, as discussed on pages 626-627, airway collapse during expiration causes $R_{a w}$ to be greater during expiration than during inspiration.

is negative, air flows in the opposite direction. As is the case with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$, the brain does not directly control PA.

## During inspiration, a sustained negative shift in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ causes PA to become transiently more negative

During a quiet respiratory cycle-an inspiration of 500 mL , followed by an expiration-the body first generates negative and then positive values of PA. The four large gray panels of Figure 27-15 show the idealized time courses of five key parameters. (T) N27-9 The uppermost panel is a record of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. The next panel is a pair of plots, $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$. The third shows the record of PA. The bottom panel shows a simultaneous record of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$.

On the right side of Figure 27-15 are the static $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve and the dynamic $\mathrm{PA}-\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ relationship (both copied from Fig. 27-14). On the left side is a series of four cartoons that represent snapshots of the key pressures (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$, and PA) at four points during the respiratory cycle:
a. Before inspiration begins. The lungs are under static conditions at a volume of FRC.
b. Halfway through inspiration. The lungs are under dynamic conditions at a volume of FRC $+250 \mathrm{~mL}$.
c. At the completion of inspiration. The lungs are once again under static conditions but at a volume of FRC +500 mL .
d. Halfway through expiration. The lungs are under dynamic conditions at a volume of FRC +250 mL .
a. At the end of expiration/ready for the next inspiration. The lungs are once again under static conditions at a volume of FRC.

The $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ record in the top gray panel of Figure 27-15 shows that $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ rises more or less exponentially during inspiration and similarly falls during expiration.

Knowing the time course of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, we obtained the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ values in the second gray panel of Figure 27-15 by reading them off the static $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ diagram to the right and plotted them as $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ (for consistency with Equation 27-12). As $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases during inspiration, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ increases (i.e., $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ becomes more negative). The opposite is true during expiration. Remember that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ (along with static compliance) determines $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ at any time.

The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ record in the second gray panel of Figure 27-15 shows that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is the same as $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ whenever the lungs are under static conditions (points $a, c$, and $a$ ). However, during inspiration, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ rapidly becomes more negative than $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ but then merges with $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ by the end of inspiration. The difference between $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ and $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is PA, which must be negative to produce airflow into the lungs. During expiration, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is more positive than $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$.

The PA record in the third gray panel of Figure 27-15 shows that PA is zero under static conditions (points $a, c$, and $a$ ). During inspiration, PA rapidly becomes negative but then relaxes to zero by the end of inspiration. The opposite is true during expiration. The PA values in this plot represent the differences between the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ and $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ plots in the preceding panel.

We computed $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ (bottom gray panel) from the relationship in Equation 27-7: $\dot{\mathrm{V}}=(\mathrm{PA}-\mathrm{PB}) / \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$. Remember that PA (along with $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ ) determines $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ at any time. Here, we assume that $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is fixed during the respiratory cycle
at $1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$. Thus, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ record has the same time course as PA.

The key message in Figure 27-15 is that during inspiration, the negative shift in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ has two effects. The body invests some of the energy represented by $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ into transiently making PA more negative (dynamic component). The result is that air flows into the lungs and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases; but this investment in PA is only transient. Throughout inspiration, the body invests an increasingly greater fraction of its energy in making $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ more positive (static component). The result is that the body maintains the new, higher $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. By the end of inspiration, the body invests all of the energy represented by $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ in maintaining $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and none in further expansion. The situation is not unlike that faced by Julius Caesar as he, with finite resources, conquered Gaul. At first, he invested all of his resources in expanding his territory at the expense of the feisty Belgians; but as the conquered territory grew, he was forced to invest an increasingly greater fraction of his resources in maintaining the newly conquered territory. In the end, he necessarily invested all of his resources in maintaining his territory and was unable to expand further.

## Dynamic compliance falls as respiratory frequency rises

In the preceding section, we examined pressure, volume, and flow changes during an idealized respiratory cycle of 5 seconds, which corresponds to a respiratory frequency of 12 breaths/min. The top curve in Figure 27-16A shows a normal $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ time course during an inspiration. As for any exponential process, the time constant ( $\tau$ ) (T) N27-10 is the interval required for $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ to be $\sim 63 \%$ complete. For healthy lungs, $\tau$ is $\sim 0.2$ second. Thus, for inspiration, the increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is $63 \%$ complete after 0.2 second, $86 \%$ complete after 0.4 second, $95 \%$ complete after 0.6 second, and so on. We will make the simplifying assumption that the time available for inspiration is half this time or 2.5 seconds, which represents $>12$ time constants! Thus, if the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ after infinite time were 500 mL , the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ measured 2.5 seconds after initiation of inspiration would also be $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ (see Fig. 27-16A, green point on top curve). In Figure 27-16B, we replot this value as the green point at a frequency of 12 breaths/min on the top curve (i.e., normal lungs).

For a respiratory frequency of 24 breaths/min, 1.25 seconds is available for inspiration. At the end of this time, the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is $\sim 499 \mathrm{~mL}$ (see Fig. 27-16B, blue point on the top curve).

If we further increase the respiratory frequency to 48 breaths/min, only 0.625 second is available for inspiration. At the end of this period, only slightly more than three time constants, the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is $\sim 478 \mathrm{~mL}$ (see Fig. 27-16B, red point on top curve). Thus, over a wide range of frequencies, $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is largely unchanged. Only when respiratory frequency approaches extremely high values does $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ begin to fall off.

The situation is very different for a subject with substantially increased airway resistance. If $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ increased 5 -fold, $\tau$ would also increase 5 -fold to 1 second. (T) N27-10 As a result, the trajectory of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ also would slow by a factor of 5 (see Fig. 27-16A, bottom curve). If we could wait long enough during an inspiration, these unhealthy lungs would

# N27-9 Model of the Respiratory Cycle 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The four large graphs with gray backgrounds in Figure 27-15 represent a hypothetical respiratory cycle. We generated the tracings using a rather simple computer model, making the following assumptions:

1. Throughout the respiratory cycle, the static compliance (C) was a constant $0.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.
2. Throughout the respiratory cycle, the resistance $(\mathrm{R})$ was a constant $1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$.
3. The initial lung volume $\left(V_{i}\right)$ was 3.2 L , corresponding to time zero in the graphs (i.e., point $a$ in the four panels).
4. During inspiration, the subject shifted $P_{i P}$ from $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to $-7.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ with an exponential time course (time constant $=0.01$ second). This value of $\tau$ for $P_{i P}$ results in a $\tau$ for $V_{i}$ of -0.2 seconds, consistent with the theoretical requirement that $\tau_{\mathrm{ic}}=\mathrm{R} \times \mathrm{C}=1 \times 0.2=0.2$ second. Thus, $P_{i P}$ is the prime mover, the parameter that our hypothetical subject controlled. A second consequence is that because (a) $P_{i P}$ changes by $2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and (b) the compliance is $0.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the total change in lung volume $\left(\Delta V_{i}\right)$ was 0.5 L .
5. Expiration was the reverse of inspiration, with $P_{i P}$ shifting from -7.5 to $-5.0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ with a time constant, once again, of 0.01 seconds. Again, the $\tau$ for $V_{i}$ was -0.2 seconds. In the actual modeling, we divided the inspiration and expiration into multiple 10 -ms intervals. Each interval had two phases, one in which we allowed the change in $P_{i P}$ to change the lung volume-but with no airflow-and a second in which we allowed air to flow as dictated by the alveolar pressure ( PA ) and airway resistance.

First phase. At time zero (point $a$ in the four panels), we imagined that we plugged the trachea with a cork and then allowed the subject to begin the inspiratory effort for a duration
of 10 ms . $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{iP}}$ became slightly more negative according to the aforementioned exponential time course. At the end of the 10-ms period, we computed the new value of $V_{i}$, knowing the current value of $P_{i P}$ and the compliance and also assuming that the air molecules inside the lung obeyed the ideal gas law ( $\mathrm{PA} \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{i}}=$ nRT). Keep in mind that because we plugged the trachea with a cork, the number of air molecules in the lung was fixed during the 10 -ms period of inspiratory effort. Thus, we could compute the new value of PA. From this new value of PA and the current value of $P_{i P}$, we could compute the $P_{i P}$ after 10 ms . Thus, at the end of the first phase, we have new values for $P_{i P}$, $V_{i}, P A$, and $P_{i P}$.

Second phase. Once we knew the new value of PA, we removed our hypothetical cork for 10 ms and allowed air to flow into the lung, governed by the equation $V_{i}=\Delta P / R$. Note that $\Delta P$ is the difference between Pb and PA . At the end of 10 ms , we replaced the cork (the flow of air is far from complete!). Knowing how many air molecules entered during the 10 -ms interval, and assuming that $P_{i P}$ has not changed, we can now recompute all the relevant parameters and start the first phase of the second cycle.

Thus, although we assumed the time course of the green $P_{i P}$-versus-time curve in the second gray panel of Figure 27-15, all of the other curves follow directly from the calculations and the assumed parameters. The time constant ( $\tau$ ) for $V_{i}$ that falls out of our computer simulation is -0.2 second. As we will see in $\mathbf{O}$ N27-10 the theoretical time constant for a change in lung volume is the product $R \times C$. In the model we have been discussing, $R \times C$ evaluates to a time constant of 0.2 seconds, which agrees well with our simulation. Note that the $\tau$ we assumed for the change in $P_{i P}$ was 0.01 second, which is considerably faster than the $\tau$ for the change in $V_{i}$ and thus is not rate limiting.

## N27-10 Calculating the Time Constant for a Change in Lung Volume

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

It should not be very surprising that the $\tau$ for the time course of $V_{i}$ is 0.2 second. Just as for electrical circuits, where the time constant of a resistor-capacitor network is $R \times C$, where $R$ is resistance and $C$ is capacitance, the time constant for inflating a lung is the product of the airway resistance and the static compliance:

$$
\tau=R \times C
$$

(NE 27-10)
For healthy human lungs, we might assume that $R$ is $\sim 1 \mathrm{~cm}$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$-on page 617 we pointed out that normal values for $R$ might range from 0.6 to $2.3 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$. We also might assume that $C$ is $-0.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Box 26-1). Thus, our predicted time constant is

$$
\tau=R \times C=\left(1 \frac{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \times \mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{~L}}\right) \times\left(0.2 \frac{\mathrm{~L}}{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)=0.2 \mathrm{~s}
$$

If $R$ increased 5 -fold from 1 to $5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} /(\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{s})$, the time constant would also quintuple:

$$
\tau=R \times C=\left(5 \frac{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \times \mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{~L}}\right) \times\left(0.2 \frac{\mathrm{~L}}{\mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)=1.0 \mathrm{~s}
$$

Note that the time constant that we have computed is a theoretical minimum. The actual $\tau$ can only be as small as $R \times C$ if the individual making an inspiratory or expiratory effort decides to change $P_{i P}$ (or is capable of changing $P_{i P}$ ) very rapidly compared to $R \times C$. If the person decides to inhale or exhale slowly, then of course the actual time course with which $V_{i}$ changes can be far larger than $R \times C$. As an extreme example, if an oboe player decides to exhale over a period of many tens of seconds, the time constant no longer depends on the mechanical properties of the lung, but on the activity of the cerebral cortex.

eventually achieve a $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 500 mL . The problem is that we cannot wait that long. Therefore, if the frequency is 12 breaths/min and inspiration terminates after only 2.5 seconds (i.e., only 2.5 time constants), the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would be only 459 mL (see Fig. 27-16B, green point on bottom curve). Thus, even at a relatively low frequency, the patient with increased $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ achieves a $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ that is well below normal.

For a respiratory frequency of 24 breaths/min, when only 1.25 seconds is available for inspiration, the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is only 357 mL (see Fig. 27-16B, blue point on bottom curve). At a respiratory frequency of 48 breaths/min, when only 0.625 second is available for inspiration, the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is only 232 mL
(see Fig. 27-16B, red point on bottom curve). Thus, the $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for the subject with increased $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ falls rapidly as frequency increases.

We can represent the change in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ during cyclic breathing by a parameter called dynamic compliance:

$$
\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}=\frac{\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}}{-\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}}
$$

Note that $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ is proportional to $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Figure 27-16B. Under truly static conditions (i.e., frequency of 0 ), $-\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ equals $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TN}}$ and dynamic compliance is the same as static compliance ( C or $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$ ) that we introduced in Equation 27-4. As frequency increases, $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ falls below $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$. The degree of divergence increases with resistance. For the normal lung in Figure 27-16B, $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and thus $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ fall by only $\sim 5 \%$ as frequency rises from 0 to 48 breaths/min. However, for the lung with a 5 -fold increased airway resistance, $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ falls by $>50 \%$ as frequency rises from 0 to 48 breaths/min.

The above pathological pattern is typical of asthma; $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is elevated, but $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$ is relatively normal. In emphysema, both $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$ are elevated (see Fig. 27-5, upper curve). Thus, a plot of $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ versus frequency would show that $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ is initially greater than $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$ at low respiratory frequencies, but it falls below $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$ as frequency increases. What do these frequency-dependent decreases in $\mathrm{C}_{\text {dynamic }}$ mean for a patient? The greater the respiratory frequency, the less time is available for inspiration or expiration, and the smaller the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ (see Fig. 27-16C). ( $\mathbf{N 2 7 - 1 1}$

This analysis greatly oversimplifies what happens in the lungs of real people. Although we have treated the lungs as if there were one value for $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ and one for $\mathrm{C}_{\text {static }}$, each conducting airway has its own airway resistance and each alveolar unit has its own static compliance, and these values vary with parameters such as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, posture, and hormonal status. As a result, some alveolar units have greater time constants than others. Airway disease may make some of these time constants substantially higher. As respiratory frequency increases, alveoli with relatively high time constants will have less time to undergo volume changes. As a result, these "slow" airways-compared with the "faster" airways-will make progressively smaller contributions to the overall ventilation of the lungs. At sufficiently high frequencies, very slow airways may drop out of the picture entirely.

## Transmural pressure differences cause airways to dilate during inspiration and to compress during expiration

We have noted three factors that modulate airway caliber: (1) the ANS, (2) humoral substances, and (3) $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (see Fig. 27-13). A fourth factor that modulates $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is flow of air through the conducting airway itself. Airflow alters the pressure difference across the walls of an airway, and this change in transmural pressure $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{TN}}\right)$ can cause the airway to dilate or to collapse. Figure 27-17A through C depicts the pressures along a single hypothetical airway, extending from the level of the alveolus to the lips, under three conditions: during inspiration (Fig. 27-17A), at rest (Fig. 27-17B), and during expiration (Fig. 27-17C). In all three cases, the lung is at the same volume, FRC; the only difference is whether air is

# N27-11 Implications of High-Frequency Breathing in a Patient with a High Time Constant 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As discussed in the text, a patient with increased airway resistance will require longer than normal to inflate the lungs by the expected $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ during an inspiratory effort (i.e., $\tau$ is increased, as in Fig. 27-16.4) and will require longer than normal to deflate the lungs to the FRC during an expiratory effort. As a consequence, as such a patient breathes with ever-increasing respiratory frequencies, the effective $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ will fall (see Fig. 27-16C). The effect on the ventilation of alveoli is even more severe.

As we shall see in Chapter 31, even in healthy lungs, not all of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ reaches the alveoli-a fixed amount ( $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$ per breath) is wasted ventilating the conducting airways (see pp. 675-676), which have no alveoli. Only the part of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ in excess of, say, 150 mL actually reaches the alveoli. Thus, as the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ gradually falls at increasing respiratory frequencies, the first volume to fall is the air ventilating the alveoli. The fall in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ in a patient with increased airway resistance (i.e., an increased $\tau \mathrm{l}$ can therefore cause alveolar ventilation to fall far more steeply than the total ventilation.

Figure 27-17 Dilation and collapse of airways with airflow. In all four panels, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is FRC. $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ is the transmural pressure across conducting airways. $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ and values in pale blue balloons represent pressures inside conducting airways (all in centimeters of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). Graphs at bottom show $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ profiles along airways (blue curve) from alveolus to mouth. $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is constant throughout the thorax (green curve). The upward (i.e., positive) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ arrows tend to expand the airways, whereas the downward (i.e., negative) $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ arrows tend to squeeze them.
flowing into the lung, not flowing at all, or flowing out of the lung. Because $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is at $\mathrm{FRC}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ (the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ for the alveoli) is $5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in all three cases.

Static Conditions First consider what happens under static conditions (see Fig. 27-17B). In the absence of airflow, the pressures inside all airways must be zero. Considering first the alveoli, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is $5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and the PA is zero, and thus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. We will ignore the effects of gravity on $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ and thus assume that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is uniform throughout the chest cavity. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ acts not only on alveoli but on all conducting airways within the thoracic cavity. For these, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ at any point is the difference between the pressure inside the airway ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ ) and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ (see Equation 27-1):

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}=0-\left(-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)=+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

In other words, a transmural pressure of $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ acts on all thoracic airways (but not the trachea in the neck, for example), tending to expand them to the extent that their compliance permits.

Inspiration Now consider what happens during a vigorous inspiration (see Fig. 27-17A). We first exhale to a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ below FRC and then vigorously inhale, so that the PA is $-15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at the instant that $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ passes through FRC.

Because the lung is at $\mathrm{FRC}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ needed to produce a PA of $-15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}} & =\left(-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)+\mathrm{PA} \\
& =-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\left(-15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right) \\
& =-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}
$$

This "inspiring" $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is just enough to produce the desired airflow and also to maintain the alveoli at precisely the same volume that they had under static conditions. But how does this exceptionally negative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ affect airways upstream from the alveoli? $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ gradually decays from $-15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the alveoli to zero at the lips. The farther we move from the alveoli, the less negative is $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$, and thus the greater is $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$.

As an illustration, consider a point about halfway up the airway's resistance profile, where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is $-8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}} & =\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}} \\
& =-8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}-\left(-20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right) \\
& =+12 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the transmural pressure opposing the elastic recoil at this point has increased from $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at rest (see Fig. 27-17B) to $+12 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ during this vigorous inspiration (see

Fig. 27-17A). Because $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ has increased, the airway will dilate. The tendency to dilate increases as we move from the alveoli to larger airways. As shown in the graph in the lower part of Figure 27-17A, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ (and thus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$, as indicated by the upward arrows) gradually increases. Note that the very positive $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ values that develop in the larger airways determine only the tendency to dilate. The extent to which an airway actually dilates also depends on its compliance. The amount of cartilage supporting the airways gradually increases from none for 11th-generation airways to a substantial amount for the mainstem bronchi. Because the increasing amount of cartilage in the larger airways decreases their compliance, they have an increasing ability to resist changes in caliber produced by a given change in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$.

Expiration As might be expected, conducting airways tend to collapse during expiration (see Fig. 27-17C). We first inhale to a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ above FRC and then exhale vigorously, so that PA is $+15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at the instant that $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ passes through FRC. Because the lung is at FRC, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ needed to produce a PA of $+15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}} & =\left(-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)+\mathrm{PA} \\
& =-5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}+\left(+15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right) \\
& =+10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}
$$

This $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ of $+10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is 5 less than the PA and thus maintains the alveoli at the same volume that prevailed under static conditions and during inspiration. What is the effect of this very positive $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ on the upstream airways? $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ must decrease gradually from $+15 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the alveoli to zero at the lips. The farther we move from the alveolus, the lower the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ and thus the lower the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$. At a point about halfway up the airway's resistance profile, where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is $+8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}} & =\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}} \\
& =+8 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}-\left(+10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right) \\
& =-2 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, at this point during a vigorous expiration, the transmural pressure opposing elastic recoil has fallen sharply from $+5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at rest (which tends to mildly inflate the airway) to $-2 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ during expiration (which actually tends to squeeze the airway). As we move from the alveoli to larger airways, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ gradually decreases. That is, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ gradually shifts from an ever-decreasing inflating force (positive values) to an ever-increasing squeezing force (negative values), as indicated by the change in the orientation of the arrows in the lower panel of Figure 27-17C. Fortunately, these larger airways-with the greatest collapsing tendencyhave the most cartilage and thus some resistance to the natural collapsing tendency that develops during expiration. In addition, mechanical tethering (see p. 620) helps all conducting airways surrounded by alveoli to resist collapse. Nevertheless, $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ is greater during expiration than it is during inspiration.

The problem of airway compression during expiration is exaggerated in patients with emphysema, a condition in which the alveolar walls break down. This process results in fewer and larger air spaces with fewer points of attachment and less mutual buttressing of air spaces. Although the
affected alveoli have an increased compliance and thus a larger diameter at the end of an inspiration, they are flimsy and exert less mechanical tethering on the conducting airways they surround. Thus, patients with emphysema have great difficulty exhaling because their conducting airways are less able to resist the tendency to collapse. However, these patients make their expirations easier in three ways. We could predict them all from our knowledge of dynamic respiratory mechanics:

1. They exhale slowly. A low $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ during expiration translates to a less positive PA and thus a less positive $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$, which minimizes the tendency to collapse.
2. They breathe at higher $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$. A high $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ maximizes the mechanical tethering that opposes airway collapse during expiration and thus minimizes $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ (see Fig. 27-13A).
3. They exhale through pursed lips. This maneuverknown as puffing-creates an artificial high resistance at the lips. Because the greatest pressure drop occurs at the location of the greatest resistance, puffing causes a greater share of the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ drop to occur across the lips than along collapsible, cartilage-free airways. Thus, puffing maintains relatively high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{AW}}$ values farther along the tracheobronchial tree (see Fig. 27-17D) and reduces collapsing tendencies throughout. The greatest collapsing tendencies are reserved for the largest airways that have the most cartilage (see p. 597). Of course, the patient pays a price for puffing: $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ and thus the ventilation of the alveoli are low.

## Because of airway collapse, expiratory flow rates become independent of effort at low lung volumes

Cartilage and mechanical tethering (see p. 620) oppose the tendency of conducting airways to collapse during expiration. Because tethering increases as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases, we expect airways to better resist collapse when $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is high. To see if this is true, we will examine how expiratory airflow varies with effort (i.e., PA) at different $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$.

Imagine that we make a maximal inspiration and then hold our breath with glottis open (Fig. 27-18A). Thus, PA is zero. In addition, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is $+30 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to maintain TLC. From Equation 27-12, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}=\left(-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}\right)+\mathrm{PA}=-30 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Now, starting from TLC, we make a maximal expiratory effort. Figure 27-18B summarizes the pressures in the alveoli and thorax at the instant we begin exhaling but before $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ has had time to change. $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$ is still $+30 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, but PA is now +40 cm $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (to produce a maximal expiration) and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is therefore $+10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. As $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ decreases during the course of the expiration, we will monitor $\dot{\mathrm{V}}, \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, and PA .

The top curve in Figure 27-18C shows how $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ changes as a function of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ when, starting from TLC, we make a maximal expiratory effort. Notice that $\dot{V}$ rises to its maximal value at a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ that is somewhat less than TLC and then gradually falls to zero as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ approaches RV. The data in this top curve, obtained with maximal expiratory effort (i.e., at maximal PA), will help us determine how expiratory flow varies with effort. To get the rest of the necessary data, we repeat our experiment by again inhaling to TLC and again exhaling to RV. However, with each trial, we exhale with less effort (i.e., at smaller PA)-efforts labeled as high, medium, and low in Figure 27-18C.

Figure 27-18 Dependence of airflow on effort. In $\mathbf{D}$, note that if airway resistance were fixed, increased effort (i.e., increased PA) would yield a proportionate increase in $\dot{V}_{L}$ as indicated by the red line. However, increased effort tends to narrow airways, raising resistance and tending to flatten the curves. As $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ decreases (e.g., 4 or 3 L ), airflow becomes independent of effort with increasingly low effort. $\mathrm{Ps}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TP}}$, and PA are all in centimeters of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

If we draw a vertical line upward from a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 5 L in Figure 27-18C, we see that, at this very high $\dot{V}_{L}, \dot{V}$ gets larger and larger as the effort increases from low to medium to high to maximal. Because these efforts correspond to increasing PA values, we can plot these four $\dot{V}$ data points (all obtained at a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 5 L ) versus PA in the top curve of Figure 27-18D. Because $\dot{V}$ increases continuously with the PA, flow is effort dependent at a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 5 L . If the airways were made of steel, this plot of $\dot{V}$ versus PA would be a straight line. Because the actual plot bends downward at higher values of PA (i.e., greater efforts), $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$ must have increased with effort (i.e., the airways collapsed somewhat).

Returning to Figure 27-18C, we see that an important characteristic of these data is that the $\dot{V}$-versus- $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ curve for maximal expiratory effort defines an envelope that none of the other three curves could penetrate. Thus, at a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 4 L , $\dot{V}$ is $\sim 7 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$, regardless of whether the expiratory effort is high or maximal (i.e., the two points overlie one another on the graph). At a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ of 3 L , the four curves have practically merged, so that $\dot{V}$ is $\sim 5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{s}$ regardless of effort. Thus, at lung volumes that are $<3 \mathrm{~L}$, it does not matter how much effort we make; the expiratory flow can never exceed a certain value defined by the envelope.

Shifting back to Figure 27-18D, we see that for the lower two $\dot{V}$-versus-PA plots, $\dot{V}$ increases with PA-up to a point. Further increases in effort (i.e., PA) are to no avail because they produce a proportional increase in $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$-expirationinduced airway collapse. Thus, the more positive values of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ not only produce more positive values of PA but also increase $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$, so that $\mathrm{PA} / \mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{AN}}$ and thus $\dot{V}$ remain constant.

At low lung volumes, flow becomes effort independent because the reduced mechanical tethering cannot oppose the tendency toward airway collapse that always exists during expiration. Moreover, at progressively lower $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, flow becomes effort independent earlier. In other words, particularly at low lung volumes, it simply does not pay to try any harder.

# ACID-BASE PHYSIOLOGY 

Walter F. Boron

Acid-base physiology is really the study of the proton, or hydrogen ion $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$. Although they are present in exceedingly low concentrations in most intracellular and extracellular fluids, protons nevertheless have a major impact on biochemical reactions and on a variety of physiological processes that are critical for the homeostasis of the entire body and individual cells. Not surprisingly, the body has evolved sophisticated systems to maintain $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$values within narrow and precise ranges in the blood plasma, intracellular fluid, and other compartments.

This chapter provides the introduction to acid-base physiology, including the chemistry of buffers, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer system, the competition between the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer system and other buffers, and the regulation of intracellular pH . In other chapters, we discuss how blood pH - and, by extension, the pH of extracellular fluidis under the dual control of the respiratory system, which regulates plasma $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ (see Chapter 31), and the kidneys, which regulate plasma $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$(see Chapter 39). In addition, we discuss the control of cerebrospinal fluid pH in Chapter 32.

## pH AND BUFFERS

## pH values vary enormously among different intracellular and extracellular compartments

According to Brønsted's definition, an acid $\bigcirc$ N28-1 is any chemical substance (e.g., $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}, \mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$) that can donate an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. A base is any chemical substance (e.g., $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COO}^{-}$, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ) that can accept an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The term alkali can be used interchangeably with base.
$\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$varies over a large range in biological solutions, from $>100 \mathrm{mM}$ in gastric secretions to $<10 \mathrm{nM}$ in pancreatic secretions. In 1909, the chemist Sørensen introduced the $\mathbf{p H}$ scale in an effort to simplify the notation in experiments in which he was examining the influence of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$ on enzymatic reactions. He based the pH scale on powers of 10: N28-2

$$
\mathrm{pH} \equiv-\log _{10}\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]
$$

Thus, when $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is $10^{-7} \mathrm{M}$, the pH is 7.0 . The higher the $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, the lower the pH (Table 28-1). It is worth remembering that a 10 -fold change in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$corresponds to a pH
shift of 1 , whereas a 2 -fold change in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$corresponds to a pH shift of $\sim 0.3$.

Even small changes in pH can have substantial physiological consequences because most biologically important molecules contain chemical groups that can either donate an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ (e.g., $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{COOH} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$) and thereby act as a weak acid, or accept an $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(e.g., $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$) and thus behave as a weak base. To the extent that these groups donate or accept protons, a pH shift causes a change in net electrical charge (or valence) that can, in turn, alter biological activity either directly (e.g., by altering the affinity for a charged ligand) or indirectly (e.g., by altering molecular conformation).
pH -sensitive molecules include a variety of enzymes, receptors and their ligands, ion channels, transporters, and structural proteins. For most proteins, pH sensitivity is modest. The activity of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{K}$ pump (see pp. 115-117), for example, falls by about half when the pH shifts by $\sim 1 \mathrm{pH}$ unit from the optimum pH , which is near the resting pH of the typical cell. However, the activity of phosphofructokinase, a key glycolytic enzyme (see p. 1176), falls by $\sim 90 \%$ when pH falls by only 0.1 . The overall impact of pH changes on cellular processes can be impressive. For example, cell proliferation in response to mitogenic activation is maximal at the normal, resting intracellular pH but may fall as much as $85 \%$ when intracellular pH falls by only 0.4 .

Table 28-2 lists the pH values in several body fluids. Because the pH of neutral water at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 6.81 , most major body compartments are alkaline.

## Buffers minimize the size of the pH changes produced by adding acid or alkali to a solution

A buffer is any substance that reversibly consumes or releases $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. In this way, buffers help to stabilize pH . Buffers do not prevent pH changes, they only help to minimize them.

Consider a hypothetical buffer B for which the protonated form $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)}$, with a valence of $n+1$, is in equilibrium with its deprotonated form $\mathrm{B}^{(n)}$, which has the valence of $n$ :

$$
\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{B}^{(n)}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Here, $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)}$ is a weak acid because it does not fully dissociate; $\mathrm{B}^{(n)}$ is its conjugate weak base. Conversely, $\mathrm{B}^{(n)}$ is a weak base and $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)}$ is its conjugate weak acid. The total buffer

Instead, a shell of water molecules surrounds a proton, forming an extended complex sometimes denoted as $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$(hydronium ion) or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}{ }^{+}$. Nevertheless, for practical purposes, we will treat the proton as if it were free. Also-as we do elsewhere in this book-we shall refer to concentrations of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$, and other ions. Bear in mind, however, that it is more precise to work with ion activities (i.e., the effective concentrations of ions in realistic, nonideal solutions).

## N28-2 Origin of the $p$ of pH

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Although the conventional wisdom is that the $p$ of pH stands for the power of 10, Norby's analysis of Sørensen's original papers reveals a far more accidental explanation.

Sørensen used $p$ and $q$ to represent two solutions in an electrometric experiment. He arbitrarily assigned the standard $q$ solution an $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$of $1 N$ (normal). That is, his standard solution had an $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$of $1 N$, which is $\mathrm{C}_{0}=10^{-9}$. His unknown, therefore, had an $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$of $\mathrm{C}_{0}=10^{-9}$. Using this approach, Sørensen proposed the nomenclature $p_{H}^{+}$... and nowadays, we use simply pH .

concentration, $[\mathrm{TB}]$, is the sum of the concentrations of the protonated and unprotonated forms:

$$
[\mathrm{TB}]=\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right]+\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}\right]
$$

The valence of the acidic (i.e., protonated) form can be positive, zero, or negative:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Weak acid } \\
& \frac{\text { (HB }{ }^{(n+1)}}{\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{NH}_{3} \quad+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \quad+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{HPO}_{4}^{2-} \quad+\mathrm{H}^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

In these examples, $\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$(ammonium), $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ (carbonic acid), and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{-}$("monobasic" inorganic phosphate) are all weak acids, whereas $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (ammonia), $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(bicarbonate), and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{PO}_{4}^{2-}$ ("dibasic" inorganic phosphate) are the respective conjugate weak bases. Each buffer reaction is governed by a dissociation constant, $K$

$$
K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right]}
$$

If we add to a physiological solution a small amount of HCl - which is a strong acid because it fully dissociates-the buffers in the solution consume almost all added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$:

$$
\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}+\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})} \rightarrow \mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}
$$

For each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$buffered, one $\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}$ is consumed. The tiny amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that is not buffered remains free in solution and is responsible for a decrease in pH .

If we instead titrate this same solution with a strong base such as $\mathrm{NaOH}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$derived from $\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}$ neutralizes almost all the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)} \rightarrow \mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

For each $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$buffered, one $\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}$ is formed. The tiny amount of added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that is not neutralized by the buffer equilibrates with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and is responsible for an increase in pH . (5) N28-3

A useful measure of the strength of a buffer is its buffering power $(\beta)$, which is the number of moles of strong base (e.g., NaOH ) that one must add to a liter of solution to increase pH by 1 pH unit. This value is equivalent to the amount of strong acid (e.g., HCl ) that one must add to decrease the pH by 1 pH unit. Thus, buffering power is

$$
\beta \equiv \frac{\frac{\text { moles/liter }}{\Delta[\text { Strong base }]}}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}}=\frac{\frac{\text { moles/liter }}{\Delta[\text { Strong acid }]}}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}}
$$

In the absence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the buffering power of whole blood (which contains erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets) is $\sim 25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit. This value is known as the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power ( $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }}$ ). In other words, we would have to add 25 mmol of NaOH to a liter of whole blood to increase the pH by 1 unit, assuming that $\beta$ is constant over this wide pH range. For blood plasma, which lacks the cellular elements of whole blood, $\mathrm{B}_{\text {non-HCO }}$ is only $\sim 5 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, which means that only about one fifth as much strong base would be needed to produce the same pH increase.

## According to the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, pH depends on the ratio $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right] /\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$

The most important physiological buffer pair is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The impressive strength of this buffer pair is due to the volatility of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which allows the lungs to maintain stable $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentrations in the blood plasma despite ongoing metabolic and buffer reactions that produce or consume $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Imagine that a beaker contains an aqueous solution of $145 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaCl}(\mathrm{pH}=6.81)$, but no buffers. We now expose this solution to an atmosphere containing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Fig. 28-1). The concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}\right)$ is governed by Henry's law (see Box 26-2):

$$
\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}=s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}
$$

At the temperature $\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and ionic strength of mammalian blood plasma, the solubility coefficient, $s$, is $\sim 0.03 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Because the alveolar air with which arterial blood equilibrates has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, or torr, $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ in arterial blood is

$$
\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{a}}=(0.03 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}) \cdot 40 \mathrm{mmHg}=1.2 \mathrm{mM}
$$

# N28-3 Buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

For each $\mathrm{H}^{+}$buffered in Equation 28-6, one $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{III}}$ is consumed. For each $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$buffered in Equation 28-7, one $\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{III}}$ is formed. Because almost all of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$is buffered, the change in the concentration of the unprotonated form of the buffer (i.e., $\Delta\left(B^{\mathrm{III}}\right)$ ) is a good index of the amount of strong acid or base added per liter of solution.

Figure 28-1 Interaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with water.

So far, the entry of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the atmosphere into the aqueous solution has had no effect on pH . The reason is that we have neither generated nor consumed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ itself is neither an acid nor a base. If we were considering dissolved $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, our analysis would end here because these gases do not further interact with simple aqueous solutions. The aqueous chemistry of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, however, is more complicated, because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reacts with the solvent (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) to form carbonic acid:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text { slow }} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}
$$

This $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ hydration reaction is very slow. (3) N28-4 In fact, it is far too slow to meet certain physiological needs. The enzyme carbonic anhydrase, (3) N18-3 present in erythrocytes and elsewhere, catalyzes a reaction that effectively bypasses this slow hydration reaction. Carbonic acid is a weak acid that rapidly dissociates into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \xrightarrow{\text { fast }} \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

This dissociation reaction is the first point at which pH falls. Note that the formation of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(the conjugate weak base of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) necessarily accompanies the formation of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ in a stoichiometry of $1: 1$. The observation that pH decreases, even though the above reaction produces the weak base $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, is sometimes confusing. A safe way to reason through such an apparent paradox is to focus always on the fate of the proton: if the reaction forms $\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{pH}$ falls. Thus, even though the dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ leads to generation of a weak base, pH falls because $\mathrm{H}^{+}$forms along with the weak base.

Unlike the hydration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the dissociation of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is extremely fast. Thus, in the absence of carbonic anhydrase, the slow $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ hydration reaction limits the speed at which increased $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ leads to the production of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can accept a proton to form its conjugate weak acid (i.e., $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ ) or release a second proton to form its conjugate weak base
(i.e., $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ ). Because this latter reaction generally is of only minor physiological significance for buffering in mammals, we will not discuss it further.

We may treat the hydration and dissociation reactions that occur when we expose water to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as if only one reaction were involved:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \\
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
\end{aligned}
$$

Moreover, we can define a dissociation constant for this pseudoequilibrium:

$$
K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]}
$$

In logarithmic form, this equation becomes (3) N28-5

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]}
$$

Finally, we may express $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in terms of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, recalling from Henry's law that $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]=s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ :

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

This is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, a logarithmic restatement of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrium in Equation 28-14. Its central message is that pH depends not on $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ per se, but on their ratio. Human arterial blood has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of $\sim 24 \mathrm{mM}$. If we assume that the pK governing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrium is 6.1 at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then
$\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{24 \mathrm{mM}}{(0.03 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mmHg}) \times 40 \mathrm{mmHg}}=7.40$ (28-17)
Thus, the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation correctly predicts the normal pH of arterial blood.

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$has a far higher buffering power in an open than in a closed system

The buffering power of a buffer pair such as $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ depends on three factors:

1. Total concentration of the buffer pair, [TB]. Other things being equal, $\beta$ is proportional to [TB].
2. The pH of the solution. The precise dependence on pH will become clear below.
3. Whether the system is open or closed. That is, can one member of the buffer pair equilibrate between the "system" (the solution in which the buffer is dissolved) and the "environment" (everything else)?

If neither member of the buffer pair can enter or leave the system, then $\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}$ can become $\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{k})}$, and vice versa, but [TB] is fixed. This is a closed system. An example of a closedsystem buffer is inorganic phosphate in a beaker of water, or a titratable group on a protein in blood plasma. In a closed system, the buffering power of a buffer pair is (3) N28-6

# N28-4 Out-of-Equilibrium $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Solutions 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

As described on page 629, adding $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to an aqueous solution initiates a series of two reactions that, in the end, produce $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and protons:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \xrightarrow{\text { Siver }} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \xrightarrow{\text { Foc }} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

In the absence of carbonic anhydrase (CA), the first reactionthe hydration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form carbonic acid-is extremely slow. The second is extremely fast. At equilibrium, the overall rate of the two forward reactions must be the same as the overall rate of the reverse reactions:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \leftarrow \xrightarrow{\text { Siver }} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \leftarrow \xrightarrow{\text { Foc }} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

The first of these reverse reactions is extremely rapid, whereas the second-the dehydration of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and water-is extremely slow in the absence of CA. As noted in the text, we can treat the system as if only one reaction were involved:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Moreover, we can describe this pseudoreaction by a single equilibrium constant. As shown by Equation 28-15, we can describe the equilibrium condition in logarithmic form by the following equation:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log _{10}\left(\frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}^{-}\right]}\right)
$$

In other words, considering only equilibrium conditions, it is impossible to change pH or $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ one at a time. If we change one of the three parameters (e.g., pH ), we must change at least one of the other two (i.e., $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ ). Unfortunately, there are many cases in which the addition of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ markedly enhances some process. For example, at identical values of intracellular pH , the activation of quiescent cells by mitogens is far more robust in the presence than in the absence of the physiological $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer. Which buffer component is critical in this case, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$? There are also many cases in which a stress such as respiratory acidosis or metabolic acidosis triggers a particular response. For example, respiratory acidosis stimulates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reabsorption by the kidney-a metabolic compensation to a respiratory acidosis, as discussed beginning on pages 641-642 in the text. Again, we can ask which altered parameter signals the kidney to increase its reabsorption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ , the rise in $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ or the fall in pH ?

In the 1990s, the laboratory of Walter Boron realized that it could exploit the slow equilibrium $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to create $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solutions that are temporarily out of equilibrium. eFigure 28-1A illustrates how one can make an out-of-equilibrium (OOE) "pure" $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ solution that contains a physiological level of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, has a physiological pH , but contains virtually no $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The approach is to use a dual syringe pump to rapidly mix the contents of two syringes, each flowing at the same rate. One syringe contains a double dose of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (e.g., $10 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) at a pH that is so low (e.g., pH 5.40 ) that, given a pK of $\sim 6.1$, very little $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is present. The other syringe contains a well-buffered, relatively alkaline solution that contains no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The pH of this second solution is chosen so that at the instant of mixing at the T connection, the solution has a pH of 7.40 . Of course, the $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$
after mixing is $5 \%$ (which corresponds to a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 37 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), and the $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is virtually zero. The solutions flow so rapidly that they reach the cell of interest before any significant re-equilibration of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Moreover, a suction device continuously removes the solution. As a result, the cells are continuously exposed to a freshly generated OOE solution.
eFigure 28-1B illustrates how one could make the opposite solution-a "pure" $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solution that has a physiological $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and pH but virtually no $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$. The OOE approach can be used to make solutions with virtually any combination of $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, and pH -at least for moderate pH values. At extremely alkaline pH values, the reaction $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{OH}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$generates $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$so fast that it effectively short-circuits the OOE approach. Conversely, at extremely acid pH values, the rapid reaction $\mathrm{H}^{+}+$ $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ creates relatively high levels of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ so that even the uncatalyzed reaction $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is high enough to short-circuit the OOE approach. Nevertheless, at almost any pH of interest to physiologists, OOE technology allows one to change $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right],\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, and pH one at a time.

Work on renal proximal tubules with OOE solutions has shown that proximal tubules have the ability to sense rapid shifts in the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration of the basolateral (i.e., blood-side) solution that surrounds the outside of the tubule. This work suggests that the tubule has a sensor for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that is independent of any changes in pH or $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The tubule uses this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-sensing mechanism in its response to respiratory acidosis (see pp. 637-638). This metabolic compensation involves a rapid increase in the rate at which it transports $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from the tubule lumen to the blood, and thus a partial correction of the acidosis.

Work on neurons cultured from the hippocampus suggests that certain neurons can detect rapid decreases in the extracellular $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$concentration $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \mathrm{L}\right)$, independent of any changes in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{c}}$ or $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{c}}$. The cell may use this detection system to stabilize intracellular pH ( pH ) during extracellular metabolic acidosis, which would otherwise lower pH .

## N28-5 Derivation of the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As shown in Equation 28-13,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \\
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
\end{aligned}
$$

We can define a dissociation constant for this pseudoequilibrium:

$$
K^{\prime}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]}
$$

(NE 28-5)
Factoring out $\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right]$, we can define an apparent equilibrium constant:

$$
\begin{aligned}
K^{\prime}\left[H_{2} O\right] & =K=\frac{\left[H^{+}\right]\left[H C O_{2}^{-}\right]}{\left[C O_{2}\right]} \\
K & =\frac{\left[H^{+}\right]\left[H C O_{2}^{-}\right]}{\left[C O_{2}\right]}
\end{aligned}
$$

(NE 28-6)

The equation immediately above is Equation 28-14 in the text. $K$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is $\sim 10^{-6.1} \mathrm{M}$ or $10^{-3.1} \mathrm{mM}$. Taking the log (to the base 10) of each side of this equation, and remembering that $\log (a \times$ $b)=\log (a)+\log (b)$, we have

$$
\log K=\log \left[H^{+}\right]+\log \frac{\left[H C O_{2}^{-}\right]}{\left[C O_{2}\right]}
$$

(NE 28-7)
Remembering that $\log \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=-\mathrm{pH}$ and $\log K=-\mathrm{pK}$, we may insert these expressions into Equation NE 28-7 and rearrange to obtain

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]}
$$

(NE 28-8)
This expression is the same as Equation 28-15 in the text. Finally, we may express $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in terms of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, recalling from Henry's law that $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]=s \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ :

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{s \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

This is the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, a logarithmic restatement of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrium in Equation NE 28-5 above.

# N28-6 Derivation of Expressions for Buffering Power in Closed and Open Systems 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

How does buffering power, in either a closed or open system, depend on pH ?

## Closed System

We start with a restatement of Equation 28-8, in which we define buffering power as the amount of strong base that we need to add (per liter of solution) in order to increase the pH by 1 pH unit. In differential form, this definition becomes the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
p H & =p K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{s \times P_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

(NE 28-10)
Second, because the change in the concentration of the unprotonated form of the buffer, $\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]$, is very nearly the same as the amount of strong base added (see Equation 28-7), Equation NE 28-10 becomes

$$
\beta=\frac{d[\text { Strong Base }]}{d \mathrm{pH}}=\frac{d\left[\mathrm{~B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]}{d \mathrm{pH}}
$$

(NE 28-11)
The third step is to combine Equation 28-3, reproduced below,

$$
K=\frac{\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]}{\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{o}+1)}\right]}
$$

(NE 28-12)
and Equation 28-5, reproduced below,

$$
[\mathrm{TB}]=\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{o}+1)}\right]+\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]
$$

(NE 28-13)
to obtain an expression that describes how $\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]$ depends on the concentration of total buffer, [TB], and $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$:

$$
\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]=[\mathrm{TB}] \frac{K}{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+K}
$$

(NE 28-14)
Finally, we obtain the closed-system buffering power by taking the derivative of $\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]$ in Equation NE 28-14 with respect
to pH . If we hold [TB] constant while taking this derivative (i.e., if we assume that the buffer can neither enter nor leave the system), we obtain the following expression for $\beta_{\text {closed }}$ :

$$
\beta_{\text {closed }}=\left(\frac{d\left[\mathrm{~B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]}{d \mathrm{pH}}\right)_{\mathrm{TB}}=2.3[\mathrm{TB}] \frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] K}{\left[\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]+K\right]^{2}}
$$

(NE 28-15)

## Open System

How does $\beta_{\text {open }}$ depend on $P_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH ? The first two steps of this derivation are the same as for the open system, except that we recognize that, for the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer pair, $\left[\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{o})}\right]$ is $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$:

$$
\beta=\frac{d[\text { Strong Base Added }]}{d \mathrm{pH}}=\frac{d\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{d \mathrm{pH}}
$$

(NE 28-16)
For the open system, the third step is to rearrange the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see Equation 28-16, reproduced below),

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K+\log \frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

(NE 28-17)
and rearrange it to solve for $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$:

$$
\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]=s \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \times 10^{(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{p} K)}
$$

(NE 28-18)
If we take the derivative of $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$in the above equation with respect to pH , holding $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ constant, the result is $\beta_{\text {open }}$ :

$$
\beta_{\text {open }}=2.3 \times s \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \times 10^{(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{p} K)}
$$

(NE 28-19)
Because Equation NE 28-18 tells us that everything after "2.3" in the above equation is, in fact, " $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$," we obtain the final expression for $\beta_{\text {open }}$ :

$$
\beta_{\text {open }}=2.3 \times\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]
$$

(NE 28-20)
This is Equation 28-20 in the text.

B MULTIPLE BUFFERS
![bo52465312c5](bo52465312c5.jpg)

Figure 28-2 Buffering power in a closed system. In $\mathbf{B}$, the solution contains nine buffers, each at a concentration of 12.6 mM and with pK values evenly spaced 0.5 pH unit apart.

$$
\beta_{\text {closed }}=2.3\left[\mathrm{TB}\right] \frac{\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \cdot K}{\left(\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}+K\right]\right)^{2}}
$$

Two aspects of Equation 28-18 are of interest. First, at a given $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right], \beta_{\text {closed }}$ is proportional to [TB]. Second, at a given [TB], $\beta_{\text {closed }}$ has a bell-shaped dependence on pH (green curve in Fig. 28-2A). $\beta_{\text {closed }}$ is maximal when $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]=K$ (i.e., when $\mathrm{pH}=\mathrm{p} K$ ). Most non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers in biological fluids behave as if they are in a closed system. Although many fluids are actually mixtures of several non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ buffers, the total $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ in such a mixture is the sum of their $\beta_{\text {closed }}$ values, each described by Equation 28-18. The red curve in Figure 28-2B shows how total $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ varies with pH for a solution containing a mixture of nine buffers (including the one described by the green curve), each present at a [TB] of 12.6 mM , with pK values evenly spaced at intervals of 0.5 pH unit. In this example, total $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is remarkably stable over a broad pH range and has a peak value that is the same as that of whole blood: $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit. Indeed, whole blood is a complex mixture of many non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. The most important of these are titratable groups on hemoglobin and, to a far lesser extent, other proteins. Even less important than the "other proteins" are small molecules such as inorganic phosphate. The [TB] values for these many buffers are not identical, and the $\mathrm{p} K$ values are not evenly spaced. Nevertheless, the buffering power of whole blood is nearly constant near the physiological pH .

The other physiologically important condition under which a buffer can function is in an open system. Here, one buffer species (e.g., $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) equilibrates between the system and the environment. A laboratory example is a solution containing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in which dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibrates with gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the atmosphere (see Fig. 28-1). A physiological example is blood plasma, in which dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibrates with gaseous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the alveoli. In either case, $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ is fixed during buffering reactions. However, the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}-\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]+\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$-can vary widely. Because total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can rise to very high values, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in an open system can be an extremely powerful buffer. Consider, for example, a liter of a solution having a pH of 7.4 , a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\left(1.2 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 24 mM -
but no other buffers (Fig. 28-3, stage 1). What happens when we add 10 mmol of HCl ? Available $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$neutralizes almost all of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, forming nearly $10 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ and then nearly $10 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ plus nearly $10 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 28-3, stage 2A). The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that forms does not accumulate, but evolves to the atmosphere so that $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ is constant. What is the final pH ? If $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ remains at 1.2 mM in our open system, and if $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$decreases by almost exactly 10 mM (i.e., the amount of added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$), from 24 to 14 mM , the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation predicts a fall in pH from 7.40 to 7.17 , corresponding to an increase in free $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$of

$$
\begin{aligned}
\Delta\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] & =\left(10^{-7.17}-10^{-7.40}\right) \mathrm{M} \\
& =0.000,068 \mathrm{mM}-0.000,040 \mathrm{mM} \\
& =0.000,028 \mathrm{mM}
\end{aligned}
$$

Even though we have added 10 millimoles of HCl to 1 L , $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$increased by only 28 nanomolar (see Fig. 28-3, stage 3A). Therefore, the open-system buffer has neutralized $9.999,972 \mathrm{mmol}$ of the added $10 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}^{+}$. The buffering provided by $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in an open system $\left(\beta_{\text {open }}\right)$ is so powerful because only depletion of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$limits neutralization of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The buildup of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is not a limiting factor because the atmosphere is an infinite sink for newly produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

The opposite acid-base disturbance occurs when we add a strong base such as NaOH . Here, the buffering reactions are just the reverse of those in the previous example. If we add 10 mmol of NaOH to 1 L of solution, almost all added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$combines with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$derived from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that enters from the atmosphere (see Fig. 28-3, stage 2B). One $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ion forms for each $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$neutralized. Buffering power in this open system is far higher than that in a closed system because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ availability does not limit neutralization of added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. Only the buildup of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$limits neutralization of more $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. In this example, even though we added 10 millimoles NaOH , free $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$decreased by only 12 nanomolars (see Fig. 28-3, stage 3B) as pH rose from 7.40 to 7.55 .

Whether $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$neutralizes an acid or a base, the open-system buffering power is $\bigcirc$ N28-6

$$
\beta_{\text {open }}=2.3 \cdot\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]
$$

Figure 28-3 Buffering of strong acids and bases by $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in an open system.

Notice that $\beta_{\text {open }}$ does not have a maximum. Because $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is proportional to $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right], \beta_{\text {open }}$ rises exponentially with pH when $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is fixed (Fig. 28-4, blue curve). In normal arterial blood (i.e., $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]=24 \mathrm{mM}$ ), $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is $\sim 55 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit. As we have already noted, the buffering power of all non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers ( $\beta_{\text {open }-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$) in whole blood is $\sim 25 \mathrm{mM} /$ pH unit. Thus, in whole blood, $\beta_{\text {open }}$ represents more than two thirds of the total buffering power. The relative contribution of $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is far more striking in interstitial fluid, which lacks the cellular elements of blood and also has a lower protein concentration.
$\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$does not necessarily behave as an opensystem buffer. In the previous example, we could have added NaOH to a $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solution in a capped syringe. In such a closed system, not only does accumulation of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ limit neutralization of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, but the availability of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is limiting as well. Indeed, for fluid having the composition of normal arterial blood, the closed-system $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power is only $2.6 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit (see Fig. 28-4, black curve), $<5 \%$ of the $\beta_{\text {open }}$ value of $55 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit.

Figure 28-4 Buffering power of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$system. At pH 7.4 on the blue curve, the solution has the same composition as does arterial blood plasma: a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 24 mM . If the system is "open" (i.e., $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibrates with atmosphere), $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is $\sim 55 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit at pH 7.40 and rises exponentially with pH (see Equation 28-20). If the system is closed, $\beta_{\text {closed }}$ is only $\sim 2.6 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit at pH 7.4 and is maximal at the pK of the buffer (see Equation 28-18).

think that the only reason the closed-system buffering power was so low in this example is that the pH of 7.4 was 1.3 pH units above the pK . However, even if pH were equal to the pK of 6.1 , the closed-system $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power in our example would be only $\sim 14 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, about one quarter of the open-system value at pH 7.4 . A physiological example in which the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$system is "poorly open" is ischemia, wherein a lack of blood flow minimizes the equilibration of tissue $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with blood $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, ischemic tissues are especially susceptible to large pH shifts.

## ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY WHEN $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ IS THE ONLY BUFFER

In this section, we consider buffering by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ when these are the only buffers present in the solution. We defer to the following section the more complex example in which both $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers are present in the same solution.

## In the absence of other buffers, doubling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes pH to fall by 0.3 but causes almost no change in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$

Figure 28-5 represents 1 L of a solution with the same $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$composition as arterial blood plasma but no buffers other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. What are the consequences of increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the gas phase? The resulting increase in $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ causes the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrium to shift toward formation of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This disturbance is an example of a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ titration, because we initiated it by altering $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. More specifically, it is a respiratory acidosis-"acidosis" because pH falls, and "respiratory" because pulmonary problems (Table 28-3) are the most common causes of an increase in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of arterial blood (see p. 680).

In the absence of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, how far pH falls during respiratory acidosis depends on the initial pH and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, as well as on the final $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. For example, doubling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 mm Hg (see Fig. 28-5, stage 1) to 80 mm Hg causes $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ to double to 2.4 mM (see Fig. 28-5, stage 2A). At this point, the 1-L system is far out of equilibrium and can

No change |

return to equilibrium only if some $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ( X mmol ) combines with $\mathrm{X}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $\mathrm{XH}^{+}$and $\mathrm{X} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Thus, according to Equation 28-14, the following must be true at equilibrium:

Solving this equation for X yields an extremely small value, nearly 40 nmol , or $0.000,040 \mathrm{mmol} . \mathrm{X}$ represents the flux of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that passes through the reaction sequence $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ $+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to re-establish the equilibrium. $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the atmosphere replenishes the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ consumed in this reaction, so that $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ remains at 2.4 mM after the new equilibrium is achieved (see Fig. 28-5, stage 3A). The reason that the flux X is so small is that, with no other buffers present, every $\mathrm{H}^{+}$formed remains free in solution. Thus, only a minuscule amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$need be formed before $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$nearly doubles from 40 to nearly 80 nM . However, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$undergoes only a tiny fractional increase, from 24 to $24.000,040 \mathrm{mM}$. The doubling of the denominator in Equation 28-21 is matched by a doubling of the numerator, nearly all of which is due to the near-doubling of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. The final pH in this example of respiratory acidosis is

$$
\mathrm{pH}=-\log (80 \mathrm{nM})=7.10
$$

Another way of arriving at the same answer is to insert the final values for $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ into the HendersonHasselbalch equation:
$\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{24.000,040 \mathrm{mM}}{(0.03 \mathrm{nM} / \mathrm{mmHg}) \cdot(80 \mathrm{mmHg})}=7.10$
(28-23)
The opposite acid-base disturbance, in which $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls, is respiratory alkalosis. In a solution containing no buffers other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reducing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by half, from 40 to 20 mm Hg , would cause all of the aforementioned reactions to shift in the opposite direction, so that pH would rise by
0.3 , from 7.4 to 7.7 . We could produce respiratory alkalosis in a beaker by lowering the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the gas phase. In humans, hyperventilation (see Table 28-3) lowers alveolar and thus arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see p. 680).

Thus, in the absence of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, doubling $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ causes pH to fall by 0.3 , whereas halving $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ causes pH to rise by 0.3 (see Table 28-1). Remember, the log of 2 is 0.3 .

## In the absence of other buffers, doubling $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ causes pH to rise by 0.3

What would happen if we doubled $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, rather than $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ? If we start with 1 L of solution that has the ionic composition of arterial blood (see Fig. 28-5, stage 1), adding 24 mmol of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(e.g., $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ) drives the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ equilibrium toward $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see Fig. 28-5, stage 2B). The new equilibrium is achieved when X mmol of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$combines with $\mathrm{XH}^{+}$to produce $\mathrm{XCO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{XH}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Because the system is open to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the generation of X mmol $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ causes no change in $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$; the newly formed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ simply evolves into the atmosphere. Thus, according to Equation 28-14, the following must be true at equilibrium:

Solving this equation yields an X of nearly $0.000,020 \mathrm{mM}$. Thus, in the absence of other buffers, an initial doubling of $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$from 24 to 48 mM causes $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$to fall by nearly half, from 40 to 20 nM . Although $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$also decreases by 20 nM , its fractional change from 48 to $47.999,980 \mathrm{mM}$ is insignificant. The final pH is:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=-\log (20 \mathrm{nM})=7.70
$$

The Henderson-Hasselbalch equation yields the same result:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=6.1+\log \frac{47.999,980 \mathrm{mM}}{(0.03 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mmHg}) \cdot(40 \mathrm{mmHg})}=7.70
$$

Thus, in the absence of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, doubling $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$causes pH to increase by $\sim 0.3$. Rather than adding $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, we could produce an identical effect by adding the same amount of strong base (e.g., NaOH ), as we did in Figure 28-3, stages 2B and 3B, or by removing the same amount of strong acid (e.g., HCl ). Although the removal of HCl from a solution in a beaker may seem artificial, the removal of gastric HCl from the body occurs during vomiting (see Table 28-3). O28-7 We also could add a weak base (e.g., $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ ) or remove any weak acid (e.g., lactic acid) other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$. However, to produce the same alkali load, we would have to add/remove more of a weak base/acid than for a strong base/acid. All of these maneuvers, carried out at a fixed $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, are examples of metabolic alkalosis-"alkalosis" because the pH increases, and "metabolic" because derangements in metabolism are common clinical causes.

The opposite acid-base disturbance-in which we remove $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or another alkali, or add an acid other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$-is metabolic acidosis. If we start with a solution having the ionic composition of arterial blood, removing half of the initial $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or removing 12 mM NaOH or adding 12 mM HCl would cause all of the aforementioned reactions to shift in the opposite direction, so that pH would fall by 0.3 , from 7.4 to 7.1 . Common causes of metabolic acidosis in humans are renal failure and metabolic problems (see Table 28-3).

We saw in Equation 28-26 that the pH of a $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ solution does not depend on $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ per se, but on their ratio. Because it is the kidney that controls $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$in the blood plasma (see Chapter 39), and because it is the lung that controls $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Chapter 31), the pH of blood plasma is under the dual control of both organ systems, a concept embodied by a whimsical variant of the HendersonHasselbalch equation:

$$
\mathrm{pH}=\text { Constant }+\frac{\text { Kidney }}{\text { Lungs }}
$$

## ACID-BASE CHEMISTRY IN THE PRESENCE OF $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$AND NON- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ BUFFERS-THE DÄVENPORT DIAGRAM

So far, our discussion has focused on simple systems in which the only pH buffers are either (1) one or more non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers or (2) $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Under these circumstances, it is relatively easy to predict the effects of acid-base disturbances. Real biological systems, however, are mixtures of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and many non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. Thus, to understand the effects of respiratory and metabolic acid-base disturbances in a biological system, we must consider multiple competing equilibria-one for $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(described by Equation 28-16) and one for each of the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers (each described by its version of Equation 28-5). Obtaining a precise solution to such clinically relevant problems is impossible. One approach is to use a computer to make
increasingly more precise approximations of the correct answer. Another, more intuitive approach is to use a graphical method to estimate the final pH . The Davenport diagram is the best such tool.

## The Davenport diagram is a graphical tool for interpreting acid-base disturbances in blood

What happens to the pH of blood-a complex mixture that includes many non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers-when $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ doubles? We simplify matters by lumping together the actions of all non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, so that $\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{(n)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)}$ represents the reactions of all non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. When we raise $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, almost all of the newly formed $\mathrm{H}^{+}$reacts with $\mathrm{B}^{(n)}$ to form $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)}$ so that the free $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$rises only slightly.
![bo56465312c5](bo56465312c5.jpg)

In this simplified approach, the final pH depends on two competing buffer reactions-one involving $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and the other involving $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)} / \mathrm{B}^{(n)}$. Computing the final pH requires solving two simultaneous equations, one for each buffer reaction.

The $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Buffer The first of the two equations that we must solve simultaneously is a rearrangement of the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation (see Equation 28-16):

$$
\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]=s \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \cdot 10^{\left(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{p} K_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)}
$$

For a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg , the equation requires that $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$be 24 mM when pH is 7.40 -as in normal arterial blood plasma. If pH decreases by 0.3 at this same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, Equation 28-29 states that $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$must fall by half to 12 mM . Conversely, if pH increases by $0.3,\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$must double to 48 mM . The blue column of Table 28-4 lists the $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$values that Equation 28-29 predicts for various pH

# N28-7 Metabolic Alkalosis Caused by Vomiting 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Because the stomach secretes HCl into the lumen of the stomach, vomiting necessarily results in a net loss of HCl , N28-9 and this by itself causes some degree of metabolic alkalosis (see p. 635). In addition, the loss of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$leads to volume contraction, that is, a decrease in effective circulating volume (see pp. 554-555). The body's multipronged response to this volume contraction (see p. 838) includes a stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis, the end point of which is increased retention of NaCl and the osmotically obligated $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. However, at the level of the renal proximal tubule, the increased levels of systemic [angiotensin II] lead not only to an increase in NaCl reabsorption, but also to an increase in $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption. Moreover, at the level of the distal nephron, the increased levels of aldosterone lead not only to an increase in NaCl reabsorption, but also to an increase in $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ reabsorption. The result is that the hormonal stimuli that represent the appropriate response to volume depletion lead, as a side effect, to a metabolic alkalosis. The proper treatment of this contraction alkalosis is not to infuse the patient with $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, but rather to
replenish the lost volume by delivering "normal saline" intravenously. With effective circulating volume returned to normal, the stimulus to the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis is removed, and the acid-base disturbance resolves.
It is interesting to note that although volume depletion causes the kidney not only to retain NaCl but also to retain $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ inappropriately, the converse is not true. That is, respiratory or metabolic acidosis cause the kidney to retain $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ but to decrease the reabsorption of NaCl , so as to maintain a constant effective circulating volume.

What this all teaches us is that the defense of effective circulating volume trumps everything (including acid-base homeostasis). However, the body's mechanisms for regulating acid-base balance are far more sophisticated than those for regulating effective circulating volume. Thus, the response to acidosis or alkalosis is precise and appropriate-and does not involve inappropriate changes in effective circulating volume that would otherwise lead to hyper- or hypotension!

## N28-9 Equivalency of Adding $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, Adding $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, and Removing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$

## Contributed by Walter Boron

Imagine that we start with 1 L of an aqueous solution at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This solution mimics blood plasma, $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2} / 24 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at pH 7.4 , and the system is "open" for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can freely enter and leave the aqueous solution so as to keep $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ constant). Moreover, this solution contains a non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer $\left(\mathrm{HB}^{2(+) \rightleftharpoons} \mathrm{H}^{+}\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{B}^{50}$ ) with a buffering power of $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit.

## Add $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$

If we were to add 1 mmol of $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ to this 1 L of solution, then $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would instantly increase by 1 mM . Of course, over time, subsequent reactions cause $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$to gradually fall as the added $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrates with the pre-existing $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer according to the overall reactions:

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

(NE 28-25)
Furthermore, because the consumption of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$goes hand in hand with the consumption of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the pH will gradually rise, which in turn upsets the equilibrium of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers:

$$
\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{59}
$$

(NE 28-26)
Thus, the rise in pH causes the $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+)} / \mathrm{B}^{59}$ equilibrium to shift to the right, thereby increasing $\left[\mathrm{B}^{59}\right]$. As a result, the final $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ would be $<1 \mathrm{mM}$. However, the changes in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and $\left[\mathrm{B}^{59}\right]$ would sum to very nearly 1 mM (i.e., the amount of $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ originally added):

$$
\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]+\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{59}\right] \cong 1 \mathrm{mM}
$$

(NE 28-27)
The reason why we use "approximately equal" in the above equation is that a tiny amount of the added $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$causes the pH to rise (i.e., it is not reflected in the $\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{59}\right]$ ).

## Add NaOH

Imagine that instead of adding $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, we add 1 mmol of NaOH to our 1 L of solution. We can imagine that virtually all of the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$would react with the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form an equivalent amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

(NE 28-28)
(Note: this reaction is equivalent to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$.) Thus, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would rise by very nearly 1 mM . The reason we say "very nearly" is that a tiny fraction of the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$would equilibrate with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, causing pH to rise:

$$
\mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}
$$

(NE 28-29)
This consumption of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$would cause pH to rise, which in turn would cause the $\mathrm{HB}^{(n+)} / \mathrm{B}^{59}$ equilibrium to shift to the right:

$$
\mathrm{HB}^{(n+1)} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{59}
$$

(NE 28-30)
As a result $\left[\mathrm{B}^{59}\right]$ would rise by a tiny amount. At the same time, however, the reaction $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$is out of equilibrium because the $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that we formed in Equation NE 28-28 yields an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$far too high for the prevailing $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. Thus, Equation NE 28-28 would partially reverse, releasing more $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to react with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, and leading to the formation of still more $\mathrm{B}^{59}$. This reversal of Equation NE 28-28 (the secondary fall in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$) would continue until eventually the reactions in both Equation NE 28-28 and Equation NE 28-30 are in equilibrium. This process is illustrated by the panels on the right side of Figure 28-7. As a result, the final $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would be less than the -1 mM that we predicted in Equation NE 28-28. However, the changes in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$

# N28-9 Equivalency of Adding $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, Adding $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, and Removing $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-cont'd 

and $\left[\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}\right]$ would sum to very nearly 1 mM (i.e., the amount of NaOH added):

$$
\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]+\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{NH}}\right] \cong 1 \mathrm{mM}
$$

(NE 28-31)
In fact, the values of $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and $\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}\right]$ in Equation NE 28-31 (i.e., the example in which we added $1 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{NaOH}$ ) are precisely the same as in Equation NE 28-27 (i.e., the example in which we added $1 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ ).

Two provisos here. First, the reaction in Equation NE 28-28 would be very slow in the absence of added carbonic anhydrase. N18-3 Nevertheless, even in the absence of carbonic anhydrase, this reaction would eventually come to equilibrium, and we could imagine that $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would eventually rise by very nearly 1 mM . Second, in this thought experiment, we are "imagining" that the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$initially reacts only with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to form $\sim 1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and that some of this $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$then dissociates to yield some $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$. In fact, a sizeable amount of the $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that we originally added will also react instantly with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(according to Equation NE 28-29), in turn leading to the formation of $\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}$ in Equation NE 28-30.

## Remove HCl

Finally, imagine that we magically remove 1 mmol of HCl from a liter of our $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solution. In real life, we could remove this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$either by consuming it in a chemical (or biochemical) reaction or by transporting it out of some biological compartment (e.g., the cytosol). We could imagine that the HCl that we remove causes the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$equilibrium to shift, thereby causing $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$to rise by very nearly 1 mM :

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}
$$

(NE 28-32)
The consumed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would come from the atmosphere. A small amount of the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$that we removed would lower pH :

$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

(NE 28-33)
However, the reaction in Equation NE 28-32 would be badly out of equilibrium because the rise in $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would be out of proportion to the fall in $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. Thus, the reaction in Equation NE 28-32 would begin to reverse, consuming some of the $\sim 1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that we initially formed. Moreover, the $\mathrm{HB}^{\text {int } / / / \mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}$ reaction would also be out of equilibrium because $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$has fallen without any change in $\left[\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}\right]$ or $\left[\mathrm{HB}^{\text {int } / \mathrm{I}}\right]$. As a result, the following will occur:

$$
\mathrm{HB}^{\text {int }+1} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}
$$

(NE 28-34)
In fact, the reaction in Equation NE 28-32 would continue to reverse, releasing some $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$as well as an equal amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ for consumption in Equation NE 28-34. Eventually, the reactions in Equations NE 28-32 through NE 28-34 would be in equilibrium. At this point,

$$
\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]+\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{\mathrm{NH}}\right] \cong 1 \mathrm{mM}
$$

(NE 28-35)
In fact, the values of $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and $\Delta\left[\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}\right]$ in Equation NE 28-35 (i.e., this example in which we removed 1 mmol HCl ) are precisely the same as in Equation NE 28-27 (i.e., the example in which we added 1 mmol NaHCO ) and in Equation NE 28-31 (i.e., the example in which we added 1 mmol NaOH ).

## Summary

Thus, regardless of whether we add 1 mmol of $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$, add 1 mmol of NaOH , or remove 1 mmol of $\mathrm{HCl} \ldots$ in the end, the result is the same. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and the $\mathrm{HB}^{\text {int } / / / \mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}}$ buffer systems will both wind up being in equilibrium, and in each example, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$will increase by the same amount, $\left[\mathrm{B}^{\text {int }}\right]$ will increase by the same amount, and pH will increase by the same amount.

Figure 28-6 Davenport diagram. In $\mathbf{A}$, the three isopleths are $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ titration curves. In $\mathbf{B}$, the solution contains nine buffers, each at a concentration of 12.6 mM and with pK values evenly spaced 0.5 pH unit apart, as in Figure 28-2B. In C, the red arrow represents the transition from a normal acid-base status for blood ("Start") to respiratory acidosis (point A) produced by raising $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to 80 mm Hg . Point B represents respiratory alkalosis produced by lowering $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to 20 mm Hg . In D, the labeled points represent the results of respiratory acidosis when $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}}$ is zero (point $A_{1}$ ), $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ (point $A$ ), and infinity (point $A_{2}$ ).
values when $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg . Plotting these $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$values against pH yields the blue curve labeled " $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ " in Figure 28-6A. This curve, which is known as a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isobar or isopleth (from the Greek isos [equal] + plethein [to be full]) represents all possible combinations of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$) and pH at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg . Table 28-4 also summarizes $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$values prevailing at $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values of 20 and 80 mm Hg . Note that at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 20 (orange column), representing respiratory alkalosis, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$values are half those for a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 at the same pH . At a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 80 (green column), representing respiratory acidosis, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$values are twice those at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 . Each of the isopleths in Figure 28-6A rises exponentially with pH . The slope of each isopleth also rises
exponentially with pH and represents $\beta_{\text {open }}$ for $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. At a particular pH , an isopleth representing a higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (i.e., a higher $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$) has a steeper slope, as Equation 28-20 predicts.

Non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$Buffers The second of the two equations that we must solve simultaneously describes the lumped reaction of all non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. To understand the origin of this equation, we begin with the green curve (surrounded by black curves) in Figure 28-6B, the titration curve of a single non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer with a pK of 7 and total buffer concentration of 12.6 mM (as for the green curve in Fig. 28-2B). At a pH of $10,\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(p+1)}\right]$ for this single buffer is extremely low

because almost all of the " B " is in the form $\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}$. As we lower pH by successively adding small amounts of $\mathrm{HCl},\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right]$ gradually rises-most steeply when pH equals pK . Indeed, at any pH , the slope of this curve is the negative of $\beta$ for this single buffer. The black curves in Figure 28-6B are the titration curves for eight other buffers, each present at a $[\mathrm{TB}]$ of 12.6 mM , with pK values evenly spaced at intervals of 0.5 pH unit on either side of 7 . The red curve in Figure 28-6B is the sum of the titration curves for all nine buffers. ( $\mathrm{N} 28-8$ Its slope-the negative of the total buffering power of all nine buffers-is remarkably constant over a broad pH range. (The red curve in Figure 28-2B shows how $\beta$, the slope of the red curve here in Figure 28-6B, varies with pH .) The red curve in Figure 28-6B represents the second of the two equations that we must solve simultaneously.

Solving the Problem Figure 28-6C is a Davenport diagram, a combination of the three $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isopleths in Figure 28-6A and the linear part of the red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration curve in Figure 28-6B. The red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line (representing $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$for whole blood, $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit) intersects with the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isopleth for a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 at the point labeled "Start," which represents the initial conditions for arterial blood. At this intersection, both $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers are simultaneously in equilibrium.

We are now in a position to answer the question raised at the beginning of this section: What will be the final pH when we increase the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of whole blood from 40 to 80 mm Hg ? The final equilibrium conditions for this case of respiratory acidosis must be described by a point that lies simultaneously on the red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line and the green isopleth for 80 mm Hg . Obtaining the answer using the Davenport diagram requires a three-step process:

Step 1: Identify the point at the intersection of the initial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth and the initial non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line (see Fig. 28-6C, "Start").
Step 2: Identify the isopleth describing the final $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ( 80 mm Hg in this case).
Step 3: Follow the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line to its intersection with the final $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth. In Figure 28-6C, this intersection occurs at point A , which corresponds to a pH of 7.19 and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 29.25 mM .

As discussed above, in the absence of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, this same doubling of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes a larger pH decrease, from 7.4 to 7.1 .

By following three similar steps, we can use the Davenport diagram to predict the final pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$under conditions of a respiratory alkalosis. For example, what would be the effect of decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by half, from 40 to 20 mm Hg ?

In Figure 28-6C follow the red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line from "Start" to its intersection with the orange isopleth for a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 20 mm Hg (point B ), which corresponds to a pH of 7.60 and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 19 mM . If the solution had not contained non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers, halving the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would have caused a larger pH increase, from 7.4 to 7.7 .

## The amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$formed or consumed during "respiratory" acid-base disturbances increases with $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$

Although it is reasonable to focus on $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ during respiratory acid-base disturbances, it would be wrong to assume that $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is constant. For example, in Figure 28-6C, where $\beta_{\text {non- } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$is $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 80 mm Hg causes $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$to increase from 24 to 29.25 mM . Thus, in each liter of solution, $5.25 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ combines with $5.25 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to form $5.25 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(which we see as the $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$value between "Start" and point A ) and $5.25 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}^{+}$. Nearly all of this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$disappears as nearly 5.25 mmol of the deprotonated non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers $\left(\mathrm{B}^{(\mathrm{n})}\right)$ consumes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to form nearly 5.25 mmol of their conjugate weak acids $\left(\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right)$. Thus, the flux through the reaction sequence in Equation 28-28 is nearly 5.25 mmol for each liter of solution.

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}-\frac{5.25 \mathrm{mM}}{\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \\
& \text { Thus, the non- } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \text {buffers drive the conversion of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { to } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \text {. These buffers minimize the increase in free } \left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] \text {that a given flux of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { can produce. Thus, with a } \\
& \text { high } \beta_{\text {non-HCO } 3} \text {, a large amount of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { must "flux" through } \\
& \text { Equation 28-30 before the free concentrations of } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \text {and } \mathrm{H}^{+} \text {rise sufficiently to satisfy the } \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \text {equilibrium } \\
& \text { (see Equation 28-14). }
\end{aligned}
$$

$\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$varies with the hemoglobin content of blood. Thus, patients with anemia have a low $\beta_{\text {non- } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$, whereas patients with polycythemia have a high $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$.

Figure 28-6D illustrates the importance of $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$. If $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$is zero, the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line is horizontal, and doubling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 80 mm Hg does not change $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$significantly (see Fig. 28-6D, point $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ ); this verifies our earlier conclusion (see Fig. 28-5, stage 3A). Simultaneously, pH falls by 0.3 , which corresponds to a near-doubling of $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$. Thus, doubling $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ leads to a doubling of the product $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, so that the ratio $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$-the equilibrium constant, $K$-is unchanged (Table 28-5, top row). Figure 28-6D also shows what happens if $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }_{3}^{-}}$

# N28-8 Davenport Diagram-Constructing the Non-HCO3 ${ }_{3}^{-}$Buffer Line 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer line (the red line in Fig. 28-6B, $C$ ) describes the buffering power of all buffers other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\left(\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}\right)$. In whole blood-here we refer to the line as the blood buffer line-hundreds of buffer groups may contribute to the overall non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power. Each of these buffer groups has its own pK and concentration, and thus its own bell-shaped curvelike the nine small curves in Figure 28-28-describing the pH dependence of its buffering power. Each of these buffer groups also has its own titration curve, as shown in Fig. 28-6B, and the sum of these titration curves (the red curve in this figure) is the combined titration curve of these buffers (i.e., $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ ). Notice that this red curve is nearly a straight line over the physiological pH range. In other words, in the physiological range, the slope of the red line is nearly constant, which is another way of stating that the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power is nearly constant over this pH range-as illustrated in Figure 28-28.

We already know from Equation 28-8 (reproduced below as Equation NE 28-21) that we can define buffering power in terms of the amount of strong acid added to the solution:

$$
\beta_{\text {Non-HCO3 }} \equiv-\frac{\frac{\text { moles } / \mathrm{L}}{\Delta[\text { Strong Acid }]}}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}}
$$

From the perspective of the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers that are at work during respiratory acidosis, $\Delta$ [strong acid] is the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ formed from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ as a result of the increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see arrow from "Start" to point A in Fig. 28-6C). Because respiratory acidosis produces $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in a $1: 1$ ratio, the amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$formed during respiratory acidosis-that is $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {total }}-\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {total }}=\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$-is the same as the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$added ( $\Delta$ [strong acid]). Thus, we can replace $\Delta$ [strong acid] in Equation NE 28-21 with $\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$and therefore somewhat paradoxically express the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power in terms of $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$:

$$
\beta_{\text {Non-HCO3 }} \equiv-\frac{\Delta[\text { Strong Acid }]}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}} \cong-\frac{\Delta\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\Delta \mathrm{pH}}=\frac{\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {total }}-\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{pH}_{\text {init }}}
$$

( $\mathrm{HES}_{28-22}$ )
$\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {tot }}$ and $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {init }}$ represent initial values (before increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-that is, the point labeled "Start" in Fig. 28-6C), and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ and pH represent final values (after increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-that is, point A in Fig. 28-6C). The equation describing the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer line is simply a rearrangement of Equation NE 28-22:

$$
\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]=\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {init }}-\beta_{\text {Non-HCO3 }}\left(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{pH}_{\text {init }}\right) \quad(\text { NE 28-23) }
$$

This equation describes a line whose slope is negative $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$. For whole blood, $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, so that the slope of the line is $\sim 25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit in Figure 28-6C. Note that because we assumed that the buffering power of the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ buffers is constant over the pH range of interest, and because this buffering power is represented by the slope of the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ buffer curve in Figure 28-6C, the function describing this buffering power must be a straight line (i.e., a function with a constant slope).

We are now in a position to understand why, in Figure 28-6C, the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer line (see Equation NE 28-23) shares the same $y$-axis as the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isopleth (e.g., the blue curve in Fig. 28-6C), which is described by Equation 28-29, reproduced here:

$$
\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]=s \times P_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \times 10^{\left(\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{pK}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)} \quad(\text { NE 28-24) }
$$

In both the case of the line describing the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power (see Equation NE 28-23) and the exponential curve describing the open-system $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ buffering power (see Equation NE 28-24), the dependent variable is $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$.

The non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer line passes through the point describing the initial conditions $\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\text {init }} \cdot \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {tot }}$ ). In Figure 28-6C, $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {init }}$ is 7.40 and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{\text {tot }}$ is 24 mM , as indicated by the point labeled "Start." Because these initial conditions for the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers can change, we will see below in the text that the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer line can translate up and down on the Davenport diagram in metabolic alkalosis and metabolic acidosis. However, as long as $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is constant, the slope of the line is always the same.

has the normal value of $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit. Here, point A is the same as point A in Figure 28-6C, and it shows that $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$increases by 5.25 mM , or $17 \%$ (see Table 28-5, middle row). Finally, if $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }}$ were $\infty$, the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ titration line would be vertical, and doubling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would not change pH at all (point $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ in Fig. 28-6D). In this case, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$would double, so that the doubling of the product $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$would match the doubling of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Table 28-5, bottom row).

## Adding or removing an acid or base-at a constant $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-produces a "metabolic" acid-base disturbance

Above, we examined the effect of adding HCl in the absence of other buffers (see Fig. 28-3). Predicting the pH change for such an acid-base disturbance was straightforward because the titration of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ consumed all buffered $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. The situation is more complex when the solution also contains non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers (Fig. 28-7, stage 1). When we add 10 mmol of HCl to 1 L of solution, the open-system $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer pair neutralizes most of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers handle some, and a minute amount of added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$remains free and lowers pH (see Fig. 28-7, stage 2A). Because the system is open, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed during buffering of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$escapes to the atmosphere. If this buffering reaction were occurring in the blood, the newly formed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would escape first into the alveolar air, and then into the atmosphere.

How much of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}(\Delta[$ strong acid $]=10 \mathrm{mM})$ follows each of the three pathways in this example of metabolic acidosis? Answering this question requires dealing with two competing equilibria, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering reactions. As for respiratory acid-base disturbances, we cannot precisely solve the equations governing metabolic acid-base disturbances. However, we can use the Davenport diagram on the left of Figure 28-7 to obtain a graphical estimate of the final pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$ through a four-step process:

Step 1: Identify the point describing the initial conditions (see Fig. 28-7, "Start" in graph on left).
Step 2: Following the black arrow labeled "2," move downward (in the direction of decreased $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$) by 10 mM the concentration of added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-to the point labeled with an asterisk. In this maneuver, we assume that the reaction $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ has initially consumed all of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Of course, if this were true, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$reaction would be far out of equilibrium and the pH would not have changed at all. Also, the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers would not have had a chance to participate in the buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.
Step 3: Through the asterisk, draw a line (see Fig. 28-7, black line in left graph) that is parallel to the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line.
Step 4: Following the black arrow labeled " 4 ," move to the intersection of the new black line and the original $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth. This intersection occurs at point C , which corresponds to a pH of 7.26 and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 17.4 mM . This maneuver tracks the reaction $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers consume nearly all of this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in the reaction $\mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{B}^{(0)} \rightarrow \mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}$. As a result, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right],\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right]$ all rise and the system equilibrates.

As a shortcut, we could bypass the two black arrows and simply follow the red arrow along the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isopleth from "Start" to point C.

We now can return to the question of how much of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$follows each of the three pathways in Figure 28-7, stage 2A. Because $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$decreased by $24-17.4=6.6 \mathrm{mM}$, the amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$buffered by $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$must have been 6.6 mmol in each liter. Almost all of the remaining $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ that we added, nearly 3.4 mmol , must have been buffered by non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. A tiny amount of the added $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, $\sim 0.000,015 \mathrm{mmol}$, must have remained unbuffered and was responsible for decreasing pH from 7.40 to 7.26 (see Fig. 28-7, stage 3A).

Figure 28-7 also shows what would happen if we added 10 mmol of a strong base such as NaOH to our 1-L solution. The open-system $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffer pair neutralizes most of the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers handle some, and a minute amount of added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$remains unbuffered, thus raising pH (see Fig. 28-7, stage 2B). The Davenport diagram on the right of Figure 28-7 shows how much of the added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$follows each of the three pathways in this example of metabolic alkalosis. The approach is similar to the one we used above for metabolic acidosis, except that in this case, we generate a new black line that is displaced 10 mM above the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line. We follow the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth to its intersection with this black line at point D , which corresponds to a final pH of 7.51 and an $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$of 31.1 mM . Thus, $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$rose by $31.1-24.0=7.1 \mathrm{mM}$. This is the amount of added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffered. Non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers must have buffered almost all of the remaining $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that we added, $\sim 2.9 \mathrm{mmol}$ in each liter. The unbuffered $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$, which was responsible for the pH increase, must have been in the nanomolar range (see Fig. 28-7, stage 3B, and Box 28-1).

During metabolic disturbances, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$makes a greater contribution to total buffering when pH and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ are high and when $\beta_{\text {non-HCO }}$ is low
In Figure 28-7, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$neutralized 7.1 mmol of the 10 mmol of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$added to $1 \mathrm{~L}(\Delta \mathrm{pH}=+0.11)$ but only

## BOX 28-1 Strong Ion Difference

Some clinicians assess acid-base disorders in terms of a virtual parameter termed strong-ion difference (SID). Unlike weak acids and bases, the so-called strong cations and strong anions are fully dissociated at physiological pH . In blood,

$$
\mathrm{SID}=\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]+\left[\mathrm{Mg}^{2+}\right]-\left[\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right]
$$

Three major limitations to the SID approach are that (1) proteins and physiological processes generally depend on pH , not SID; (2) cells and the body closely regulate pH but have no known mechanism for directly sensing or regulating SID; and (3) SID neither is uniquely related to pH nor has a causal role in changing pH . Because the SID approach provides no new mechanistic insight, we focus on the classical pH /buffer approach.

Figure 28-7 Metabolic acidosis and alkalosis in the presence of non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers. The red arrows in the Davenport diagrams represent the transition to metabolic acidosis (point C) and metabolic alkalosis (point D). This example differs from Figure 28-3, in which the solution contained no buffers other than $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$.

6.6 mmol of the added 10 mmol of $\mathrm{H}^{+}(\Delta \mathrm{pH}=-0.14)$. The reason for this difference is that the buffering power of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in an open system increases exponentially with pH (see Fig. 28-4, blue curve). In the Davenport diagram, this pH dependence of $\beta_{\text {open }}$ appears as the slope of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ isopleth, which increases exponentially with pH . Thus, adding alkali will always cause a smaller pH change than adding an equivalent amount of acid. In our example of metabolic alkalosis (see right side of Fig. 28-7), the mean $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is $(7.1 \mathrm{mM}) /(0.11 \mathrm{pH}$ unit $)=65 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit in the pH range 7.40 to 7.51 (Table 28-6). On the other hand, in our example of metabolic acidosis (see left side of Fig. 28-7), the mean $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is $(6.6 \mathrm{mM}) /(0.14 \mathrm{pH}$ unit $)=47 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit in the pH range 7.26 to 7.40 , substantially less than in the more alkaline range. Because $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit over the entire pH range, $\beta_{\text {total }}$ is greater in the alkaline pH range.

We have already seen that $\beta_{\text {open }}$ is proportional to $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$(see Equation 28-20) and that-at a fixed $\mathrm{pH}-$ $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Equation 28-29). Thus, other things being equal, the contribution of $\beta_{\text {open }}$ to total buffering increases with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Patients with a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ due to respiratory failure will, therefore, have a higher buffering power than normal individuals at the same pH .

Because $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers compete for added $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$or $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, the contribution of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$to total buffering also depends on $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$. Figure 28-8 illustrates the effects of adding 10 mmol NaOH to our standard $1-\mathrm{L}$ $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$solution at $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ values of $0,25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, and $\infty$. We saw in Figure 28-3, stage 3B, that adding 10 mmol of NaOH to a $1-\mathrm{L}$ solution containing $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ but no other buffers causes $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$to increase from 24 to 34 mM , and pH to increase from 7.40 to 7.55 . To use a Davenport diagram to solve the same problem (see Fig. 28-8A), we generate a non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line with slope of zero (because $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}=0$ ) through the "Start" point. We also draw a black line with the same slope, but displaced 10 mM higher. Following the blue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=40$ isopleth from "Start" to the point where the isopleth intersects with the black line at point $\mathrm{D}_{1}$, we see that-as expected-the final pH is 7.55 and the final $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is 34 mM . Thus, $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ must buffer virtually all 10 mmol of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$added to 1 L . Because the total buffering power is simply $\beta_{\text {open }}$, the pH increase must be rather large, 0.15 .

When $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is $25 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit, as in the Davenport diagram in the upper right of Figure 28-7 (replotted in Fig. 28-8B), $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can buffer only 7.1 mmol because the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers neutralize 2.9 mmol . With the increased total buffering power, the pH increase is only 0.11 .

Finally, when $\beta_{\text {non-HCO3 }}$ is $\infty$, the black line lies right on top of the vertical non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line (see Fig. 28-8C). Thus, neither $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$nor pH changes at all. However,

$\left[\mathrm{HB}^{(\mathrm{n}+1)}\right]$ increases by 10 mM because the infinitely powerful non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffers do all of the buffering.

This set of three examples-for $\beta_{\text {non- } \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}}$values of 0,25 , and $\infty$-is comparable to the set that we discussed above for respiratory acidosis in Figure 28-6D.

## A metabolic change can compensate for a respiratory disturbance

Thus far, we have considered what happens during primary respiratory and metabolic acid-base disturbances. When challenged by such acid or alkaline loads in the blood plasma, the body compensates by altering $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, returning pH toward its initial value and minimizing the magnitude of the overall pH change.

In Figure 28-9A we revisit an example, originally introduced in Figure 28-6C, in which we produced a primary respiratory acidosis by increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 80 mm Hg (red arrow in Fig. 28-9A between "Start" and point A at pH 7.19). If the high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ persists, the only way we can restore pH toward its initial value of 7.40 is to add an alkali (e.g., $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$) or remove an acid (e.g., $\mathrm{H}^{+}$), all of which are equivalent. ( $\mathrm{N28-9}$ Adding 10 mmol of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to 1 L , for example, superimposes a metabolic alkalosis on the primary respiratory acidosis-a metabolic compensation to respiratory acidosis.

The Davenport diagram predicts the consequences of adding 10 mmol of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to 1 L . We start by generating a black line that is parallel to the red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line, but displaced upward by 10 mM . Point $\mathrm{A}_{1}$, the intersection of the black line and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth for 80 mm Hg , represents a final pH of 7.29 , still lower than the normal 7.40 , but much higher than the 7.19 prevailing before compensation.

If we add an additional $14 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{OH}^{-}$, for a total addition of $24 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{OH}^{-}$to $1 \mathrm{~L}, \mathrm{pH}$ returns to exactly its initial value of 7.40 (point $\mathrm{A}_{2}$ in Fig. 28-9A). In other words, we can perfectly compensate for doubling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 ("Start") to 80 mm Hg (point A) by adding an amount of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$equivalent to the amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that was present (i.e., 24 mM ) at "Start." Perfect compensation of respiratory acidosis is an example of isohydric hypercapnia (i.e., same pH at a higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{pH} & =6.1+\log \frac{\frac{\text { Doubled }\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]}{48 \mathrm{mM}}}{(0.03 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{mmHg}) \times 80 \mathrm{mmHg}} \\
& =7.4
\end{aligned}
$$

The kidneys are responsible for the metabolic compensation to a primary respiratory acidosis. They acutely sense high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and may also chronically sense low blood pH . The response is to increase both the secretion of acid into the urine and the transport of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the blood (see pp. 832-833), thereby raising plasma pH - a compensatory metabolic alkalosis. The renal compensation to a substantial respiratory acidosis is not perfect, so that pH remains below the normal value of 7.40 .

The kidneys can also perform a metabolic compensation to a respiratory alkalosis. In Figure 28-9B we revisit a second example, originally introduced in Figure 28-6C, in which we produced a primary respiratory alkalosis by decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 20 mm Hg (red arrow in Fig. 28-9B between "Start" and point B at pH 7.60 ). We can compensate for most of this respiratory alkalosis by adding 10 mmol of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to each liter of solution or by removing $10 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ or NaOH , all of which produce the same effect. We generate a black line that is parallel to the red non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line but is displaced downward by 10 mM . Point $\mathrm{B}_{1}(\mathrm{pH} 7.44$ ), at the intersection of the black line and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth for 20 mm Hg , represents a partial compensation.

![bo66465312c5](bo66465312c5.jpg)

Figure 28-10 Respiratory compensation to primary metabolic acid-base disturbances.

If we add an additional $2 \mathrm{mmol} \mathrm{H}^{+}$, for a total addition of 12 mmol of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$to each liter, pH returns to exactly its initial value of 7.40 (point $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ in Fig. 28-9B). Why is this amount so much less than the 24 mmol of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$that we added to each liter to compensate perfectly for a doubling of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ? When we halve $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, we need only add an amount of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$equivalent to half the amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that was present $(24 / 2=12 \mathrm{mM})$ at "Start."

In response to a primary respiratory alkalosis, the kidneys secrete less acid into the urine and transport less $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$into the blood (see pp. 833-834), thereby lowering plasma $\mathrm{pH}-\mathrm{a}$ compensatory metabolic acidosis.

## A respiratory change can compensate for a metabolic disturbance

Just as metabolic changes can compensate for respiratory disturbances, respiratory changes can compensate for metabolic ones. In Figure 28-10A we return to an example originally introduced on the left side of Figure 28-7, in which we produced a primary metabolic acidosis by adding 10 mmol of HCl to 1 L of arterial blood (red arrow in Fig. 28-10A between "Start" and point C at pH 7.26). Other than removing the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(or adding $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to neutralize the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$), the only way we can restore pH toward the initial value of 7.40 is to lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. That is, we can superimpose a respiratory alkalosis on the primary metabolic acidosis-a respiratory compensation to a metabolic acidosis. For example, we can compensate for most of the metabolic acidosis by reducing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 30 mm Hg . Starting at C , follow the black line from the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth for 40 mm Hg to the new isopleth for 30 mm Hg at point $\mathrm{C}_{1}(\mathrm{pH} 7.34$ ). This maneuver represents a partial compensation.

If we reduce $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by an additional 6.6 mm Hg to 23.4 mm Hg , we produce a perfect compensation, which we represent in Figure 28-10A by following the black line from C until we reach pH 7.40 at point $\mathrm{C}_{2}$, which is on the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ isopleth for 23.4 mm Hg . Perfect compensation requires that we reduce $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by a fraction (i.e., $[40-23.4] / 40 \cong 0.42$ )
that is identical to the ratio of added HCl to the original $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$(i.e., $10 / 24 \cong 0.42$ ).

Not surprisingly, the respiratory system is responsible for the respiratory compensation to a primary metabolic acidosis. The low plasma pH or $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$stimulates the peripheral chemoreceptors (see p. 710) and, if sufficiently long-standing, also the central chemoreceptors (see pp. 713715). The result is an increase in alveolar ventilation, which lowers $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see pp. 679-680) and thus provides the respiratory compensation.

The body achieves a respiratory compensation to a primary metabolic alkalosis in just the opposite manner. In Figure 28-10B, we revisit an example originally presented on the right side of Figure 28-7, in which we produce a primary metabolic alkalosis by adding 10 mmol of NaOH to 1 L (red arrow in Fig. 28-10B between "Start" and point D at pH 7.51). If we now increase $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to 50 mm Hg , we partially compensate for the metabolic alkalosis by moving from D to $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ ( pH 7.44 ). If we raise $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by an additional 6.7 mm Hg to $\sim 56.7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the compensation is perfect, and pH returns to $7.40\left(\mathrm{D}_{2}\right)$.

In response to a primary metabolic alkalosis, the respiratory system decreases alveolar ventilation and thereby raises $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The compensatory respiratory acidosis is the least "perfect" of the four types of compensation we have discussed. The reason is that one can decrease alveolar ventilation-and thus oxygenation-only so far before compromising one's very existence.

In a real person, each of the four primary acid-base disturbances-points A, B, C, and D in Figures 28-9 and 28-10-occurs in the extracellular fluid. In each case, the body's first and almost instantaneous response is to use extracellular buffers to neutralize part of the acid or alkaline load. In addition, cells rapidly take up some of the acid or alkaline load and thus participate in the buffering, as discussed below. Furthermore, renal tubule cells may respond to a metabolic acidosis of extrarenal origin (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) by increasing acid secretion into the urine, or to a metabolic alkalosis (e.g., $\mathrm{NaHCO}_{3}$ therapy) by

decreasing acid secretion-examples of metabolic compensation to a metabolic disturbance. Points C and D in Figure 28-10 include the effects of the actual acid or alkaline load, extracellular and intracellular buffering, and any renal (i.e., "metabolic") response.

## Position on a Davenport diagram defines the nature of an acid-base disturbance

The only tools needed for characterizing acid-base status (i.e., $\mathrm{pH},\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ) are a Davenport diagram and electrodes for measuring pH and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. From these last two parameters, we can compute $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$using the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation. The acid-base status of blood plasma-or of any aqueous solution-must fall into one of five major categories:

1. Normal. For arterial blood, pH is $7.40,\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$is 24 mM , and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg . This point was labeled "Start" in the previous figures and is the central point in Figure 28-11A through $D$.
2. One of the four primary (or uncompensated) acid-base disturbances. The coordinates for pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$fall either (a) on the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$titration line, but off the $40-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ isopleth for uncompensated respiratory acidosis (point A, Fig. 28-11A) or alkalosis (point B); or (b) on the $40-\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ isopleth, but off the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$
titration line for an uncompensated metabolic acidosis (point C) or alkalosis (point D).
3. A partially compensated disturbance. The coordinates for pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$fall in any of the four colored regions of Figure 28-11B. For example, point $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ in the blue region represents a partially compensated respiratory acidosis. In a subject for whom a respiratory acidosis has existed for longer than a few hours, increased renal $\mathrm{H}^{+}$excretion has probably already begun producing a metabolic compensation. Depending on the extent of the original acidosis and the degree of compensation, point $\mathrm{A}_{1}$ could lie anywhere in the blue region. We can reach similar conclusions for the other three disturbances/ compensations.
4. A perfectly compensated disturbance. The point falls on the vertical line through pH 7.4 . As indicated by point $\mathrm{A}_{2} \mathrm{D}_{2}$ in Figure 28-11C, a perfect compensation following respiratory acidosis is indistinguishable from that following metabolic alkalosis. In either case, the final outcome is isohydric hypercapnia. Similarly, point $\mathrm{B}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{2}$ represents a perfect compensation following either metabolic acidosis or respiratory alkalosis (isohydric hypocapnia).
5. A compound respiratory/metabolic disturbance. The point falls in one of the two colored regions in Figure 28-11D. For example, points $\mathrm{A}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{C}_{3}$ represent a respiratory acidosis complicated by metabolic acidosis, and

vice versa. The second disturbance causes the pH to move even further away from "normal," as might occur in an individual with both respiratory and renal failure (see Table 28-3). Of course, it is impossible to determine if one of the two compounding disturbances developed before the other.

## pH REGULATION OF INTRACELLULAR FLUID

Clinicians focus on the acid-base status of blood plasma, the fluid compartment whose acid-base status is easiest to assess. However, the number of biochemical reactions and other processes that occur outside a cell pales in comparison to the number of those that occur inside. It stands to reason that the most important biological fluid for pH regulation is the cytosol. It is possible to monitor intracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$ continuously in isolated cells and tissues using pH -sensitive dyes or microelectrodes. Moreover, using magnetic resonance techniques, one can monitor pH , in living humans (e.g., in skeletal muscle). The pH of cells both influences, and is influenced by, extracellular pH .

## Ion transporters at the plasma membrane closely regulate the pH inside of cells

Figure 28-12A shows a hypothetical cell with three acid-base transporters: an electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter (NBCn1; see p. 122) a Na-H exchanger (NHE1; pp. 124125), and a $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ or anion exchanger (AE2; see p. 124). We will use NBCn1 and NHE1 as prototypic acid extruders, transporters that tend to raise intracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$. Both use the energy of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$gradient to either import $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$or export $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from the cytosol. We will take the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$

exchanger AE2 as the prototypic acid loader, a transporter that tends to lower $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$. AE2, driven by the steep out-to-in $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$gradient, moves $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out of the cell. The intracellular acid loading produced by $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange is a chronic acid load because it tends to acidify the cell as long as the transporter is active. In our example, the chronic acid extrusion via NBCn1 and NHE1 balances the chronic acid loading via AE2, producing a steady state. Several other acid extruders and acid loaders may contribute to pH , regulation (see p. 127), and each cell type has a characteristic complement of such transporters.

Imagine that we use a micropipette to inject HCl into the cell in Figure 28-12A. This injection of an acute acid load-a one-time-only introduction of a fixed quantity of acidcauses an immediate fall in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (see Fig. 28-12B, black curve), an example of intracellular metabolic acidosis. If we add HCl to a beaker, the pH remains low indefinitely. However, when we acutely acid-load a cell, $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ spontaneously recovers to the initial value. This $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ recovery cannot be due to passive $\mathrm{H}^{+}$efflux out of the cell, inasmuch as the electrochemical gradient for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(see p. 127) usually favors $\mathrm{H}^{+}$influx. Hence, the $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ recovery reflects the active transport of acid from the cell-a metabolic compensation to a metabolic acid load. 0 N28-10

During the recovery of $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ from the acid load in Figure 28-12B, NBCn1 and NHE1not only must extrude the quantity of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$previously injected into the cell (the acute acid load), they also must counteract whatever acid loading AE2 continues to impose on the cell (the chronic acid load).

Acid-extrusion rates tend to be greatest at low $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ values and fall off as pH , rises (see Fig. 28-12C, black curve). As discussed below, low pH , also inhibits AE2 and thus acid loading. The response to low $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ therefore involves two feedback loops operating in push-pull fashion, stimulating acid extrusion and inhibiting acid loading.

In addition to $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$, hormones, growth factors, oncogenes, cell volume, and extracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ all can modulate these transporters. The $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ effect is especially important. In general, a low $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ slows the rate of $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ recovery from acute acid loads and reduces the final steady-state $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (see Fig. 28-12B, red curve), whereas a high $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ does the opposite (blue curve). The underlying cause of these $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ effects is a shift of the pH , dependence of acid extrusion (see Fig. 28-12C, red and blue curves) and, as we shall see, changes in acid loading.

Cells also spontaneously recover from acute alkaline loads. If we inject a cell with potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) (see Fig. 28-12D), pH , rapidly increases but then slowly recovers to its initial value (see Fig. 28-12E, black curve), which reflects stimulation of acid loading and inhibition of acid extrusion. The injection of $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$represents a metabolic alkalosis, whereas increased $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange represents a metabolic compensation. (○) N28-10 The $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger is most active at high pH , values (see Fig. 28-12F). As discussed previously, increases in pH , generally inhibit acid extruders. Thus, the response to alkaline loads-like the response to acid loads-includes dual feedback loops operating in push-pull fashion, stimulating acid loading and inhibiting acid extrusion. During the $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ recovery from an acute alkaline load, $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange not only must neutralize the alkali previously injected into the cell (the acute
alkali load), but also must counteract the alkalinizing effect of acid extruders such as the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter.

Like acid extruders, $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers are under the control of hormones and growth factors with a $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ sensitivity that is opposite to that of the acid extruders (i.e., low $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ enhances $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange). In general, an extracellular metabolic acidosis, with its simultaneous fall in both $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$(see Table 28-3), stimulates acid loading via $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange (see Fig. 28-12F, red curve). During the recovery from acute alkali loads, metabolic acidosis therefore causes pH , to fall more rapidly and to reach a lower steady-state value (see Fig. 28-12E, red curve).

## Indirect interactions between $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$make it appear as if cells have a K-H exchanger

Clinicians have long known that extracellular acidosis leads to a release of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from cells, and thus hyperkalemia (see p. 795). Conversely, hyperkalemia leads to the exit of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ from cells, resulting in extracellular acidosis. These observations, which one can duplicate in single, isolated cells, led to the suggestion that cells generally have K-H exchangers. It is true that specialized cells in the stomach (see pp. 865-866) and kidney (see pp. 827-828) do have an ATP-driven pump that extrudes $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in exchange for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$. Moreover, the $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter described in certain cells could mimic a K-H exchanger. Nevertheless, the effects that long ago led to the $\mathrm{K}-\mathrm{H}$-exchange hypothesis probably reflect indirect interactions of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$.

One example of apparent K-H exchange is that hyperkalemia causes an intracellular alkalosis. Not only is this effect not due to a $1: 1$ exchange of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$, it is not even due to the increase in $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ per se. Instead, the high $\left[\mathrm{K}^{+}\right]_{\mathrm{o}}$ depolarizes the cell, and this positive shift in membrane voltage can promote events such as the net uptake of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$via the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter (see p. 122) and thus a rise in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$-a depolarization-induced alkalinization. Depolarization also can indirectly stimulate other transporters that alkalinize the cell. We discuss the converse example of acidemia causing hyperkalemia on page 795: Extracellular acidosis lowers pH , and inhibits transporters responsible for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$uptake, which leads to net $\mathrm{K}^{+}$release from cells. Although we have no evidence that a K-H exchanger exists in humans, imagining that it exists is sometimes a helpful tool for quickly predicting interactions of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in a clinical setting.

## Changes in intracellular pH are often a sign of changes in extracellular $\mathrm{pH}_{\text {, }}$ and vice versa

By definition, acid extrusion (e.g., $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransport) equals acid loading (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange) in the steady state. Disturbing this balance shifts $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$. For example, extracellular metabolic acidosis inhibits acid extrusion and stimulates acid loading, thus lowering steady-state $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$. This intracellular acidosis is not instantaneous, but develops over a minute or two. Conversely, extracellular metabolic alkalosis leads to a slow increase in steady-state $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. Generally, a change in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ shifts $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ in the same direction, but $\Delta \mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is usually only $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ of $\Delta \mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$. In other words, an extracellular metabolic acidosis causes a net transfer of acid from the extracellular to the intracellular space, and an

# N28-10 Acid Extruders and Acid Loaders in a Cell 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Of the acid extruders that can produce pH , recovery, the most widely distributed is the NHE1 isoform of the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger. However, mechanisms that mediate $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$uptake often coexist with the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger in the same cell and are sometimes far more powerful than the $\mathrm{Na}-\mathrm{H}$ exchanger. These $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$transporters include the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-driven $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (or NDCBE, illustrated in Fig. 5-14, no. 17) and the $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometries of 1:2 (NBCe1 and NBCe2, the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters) and 1:1 (NBCn1, the electroneutral $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter). Note that the electrogenic $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter that operates with an $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometry of 1:3 (see Fig. 5-14, no. 19) mediates net $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$efflux-which reflects the ionic and electrical gradients that govern its thermodynamic properties-and functions as an acid loader. However, the $\mathrm{Na} /$ $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}: \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$stoichiometries of 1:2 and 1:1 both mediate the net uptake of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and function as acid extruders.

Other transporters that extrude acid from cells include the V-type H pump and the H-K exchange pump.

Other transport processes that acid-load cells include the passive influx of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$as well as the efflux of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$either through channels (e.g., gamma-aminobutyric acid or glycineactivated $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels) or through the $\mathrm{K} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporter.

For a more detailed discussion of these transporters, see page 127 .

Figure 28-13 Response of cell to extracellular respiratory acidosis.
extracellular metabolic alkalosis has the opposite effect. Thus, cells participate in buffering extracellular acid and alkali loads.

Extracellular respiratory acidosis generally affects $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ in three phases. First, the increase in extracellular $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ creates an inwardly directed gradient for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This dissolved gas rapidly enters the cell (Fig. 28-13A) and produces $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. This intracellular respiratory acidosis manifests itself as a rapid fall in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (see Fig. 28-13B, phase A in lower panel). Carbonic anhydrase (1) 978-3 greatly accelerates the formation of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, so that $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ can complete its decline in just a few seconds.

The cell recovers from this acid load, but only feebly (see Fig. 28-13B, phase B in lower panel) because the decrease in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ inhibits acid extrusion and stimulates acid loading. Over a period of minutes, pH , may recover only partially if at all.

Finally, the extracellular respiratory acidosis stimulates the kidneys to upregulate acid-base transporters and thus stimulate urinary acid secretion (see p. 832). The net effect, over a period of hours or days, is an extracellular metabolic compensation that causes $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ to increase gradually (see Fig. 28-13B, phase C in upper panel). As $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ rises, it gradually relieves the inhibition of NBCn1 and NHE1 and other acid extruders and cancels the stimulation of $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchange and other acid loaders. Thus, intracellular pH recovers in parallel with extracellular pH , albeit by only $20 \%$ to $60 \%$ as
much as $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ (see Fig. 28-13B, phase C in lower panel). The pH , recovery represents an intracellular metabolic compensation to the intracellular respiratory acidosis.

Not all cell types have the same resting $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. Moreover, different cell types often have very different complements of acid-base transporters and very different ways of regulating these transporters. Nevertheless, the example in Figure 28-13 illustrates that the fate of $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ is closely intertwined with that of interstitial fluid, and thus blood plasma. During respiratory acid-base disturbances, the lungs generate the insult, and virtually every other cell in the body must defend itself against it. In the case of metabolic acidbase disturbances, however, some cells may generate the insult, whereas the others attempt to defend themselves against it. From a teleological perspective, one can imagine that the primary reason that the body regulates the pH of the blood plasma and extracellular fluids is to allow the cells to properly regulate their $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$. The primary reason why the clinical assessment of blood acid-base parameters can be useful is that these parameters tend to parallel cellular acidbase status.

# TRANSPORT OF OXYGEN AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN THE BLOOD 

Walter F. Boron

## CARRIAGE OF $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

## The amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in blood is far too small to meet the metabolic demands of the body

Blood carries oxygen in two forms. More than $98 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ normally binds to hemoglobin within the erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells or RBCs (see pp. 434-435). A tiny fraction physically dissolves in the aqueous phases of both blood plasma and the cytoplasm of blood cells (predominantly RBCs). What is the significance of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that is bound to hemoglobin?

Imagine that we expose a liter of blood plasma, initially free of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, to an atmosphere having the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ as alveolar air -100 mm Hg . Oxygen will move from the atmosphere to the plasma until an equilibrium is established, at which time the concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}\right)$ in the blood obeys Henry's law (see p. 593):

$$
\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}=k_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cdot \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}
$$

If we express $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in units of mm Hg at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ in units of ( mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas)/( dL of blood), then the solubility $\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $\sim 0.003 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} /(\mathrm{dL}$ of blood $\cdot \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$. For arterial blood,

$$
\begin{aligned}
{\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }} } & =\frac{0.003 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{100 \mathrm{~mL} \text { blood } \cdot \mathrm{mmHg}} \cdot 100 \mathrm{mmHg} \\
& =0.3 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / 100 \mathrm{~mL} \text { blood }
\end{aligned}
$$

Is such an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-carrying capacity adequate for supplying $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the systemic tissues? If these tissues could extract all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in arterial blood so that no $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ remained in venous blood, and if cardiac output (see p. 414) were $5000 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, then-according to the Fick principle (see p. 423)-the delivery of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues would be

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \overbrace{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}^{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\overbrace{\frac{5000 \mathrm{~mL} \text { blood }}{m \mathrm{~m}}}^{\text {Blood flow }} \cdot \overbrace{\frac{0.3 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{100 \mathrm{~mL} \text { blood }}}^{\text {O2 }} \\
& =15 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, the average $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human at rest consumes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at the rate of $\sim 250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ could supply the body's metabolic demands only if cardiac output increased by a factor of $250 / 15$, or nearly 17 -fold! Thus, the body cannot rely on dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as a mechanism for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carriage.

## Hemoglobin consists of two $\alpha$ and two $\beta$ subunits, each of which has an iron-containing "heme" and a polypeptide "globin"

Normal adult hemoglobin (Hb) is a tetramer having a molecular weight of $\sim 68 \mathrm{kDa}$, each monomer consisting of a heme and a globin (Fig. 29-1A). The heme is a porphyrin compound coordinated to a single iron atom. The globin is a polypeptide, either an $\alpha$ chain ( 141 amino acids) or a $\beta$ chain ( 146 amino acids). The homology between the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains is sufficient that they have similar conformations, a series of seven helices enveloping a single heme. Thus, the complete Hb molecule has the stoichiometry $[\alpha(\text { heme })]_{2}[\beta(\text { heme })]_{2}$ and can bind as many as four $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules, one for each iron atom. The erythroblasts (see pp. 431-433) that synthesize Hb closely coordinate the production of $\alpha$ chains, $\beta$ chains, and heme.

Heme is a general term for a metal ion chelated to a porphyrin ring. In the case of Hb , the metal is iron in the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ or ferrous state (see Fig. 29-1B). The porphyrin consists of four linked pyrrole rings that, through their nitrogen atoms, coordinate a single, centrally located $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$. Because the ironporphyrin complex is rich in conjugated double bonds, it absorbs photons of relatively low energy (i.e., light in the visible range). The interaction among $\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$, and porphyrin causes the complex to have a red color when fully saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (e.g., arterial blood) and a purple color when devoid of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (e.g., venous blood).

Hb can bind $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ only when the iron is in the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ state. The $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ in Hb can become oxidized to ferric iron $\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}\right)$, either spontaneously or under the influence of compounds such as nitrites or sulfonamides. The result of such an oxidation is methemoglobin (metHb), which is incapable of binding $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Inside the RBC , a heme-containing enzyme methemoglobin reductase uses the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) to reduce metHb back to Hb , so that only about $1.5 \%$ of total Hb is in the metHb state. In the rare case in which a genetic defect results in a deficiency of this enzyme, N29-1 metHb may

# N29-1 Methemoglobinemia 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

An increase in the amount of Hb with its iron in the oxidized or $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ (i.e., ferric) state is known as methemoglobinemia. As discussed on pages 647-648, the problem that arises is that, with $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in the porphyrin ring of $\mathrm{Hb}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$ cannot bind, and there is a consequent reduction in the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carrying capacity of the blood. The $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ (i.e., ferrous) iron of Hb spontaneously oxidizes to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, and a family of methemoglobin reductase enzymes normally returns the Hb to the ferrous state.

Methemoglobinemia can arise in three ways:

1. Mutant $M$ forms of Hb. Normally the globin moiety of Hb cradles the porphyrin ring in such a way as to limit the accessibility of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. In M forms of Hb (at least eight of which have been identified), point mutations in the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ globin chains allow the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to approach the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ more closely and to oxidize—rather than to bind to-the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$.
This action shifts the balance between the normally slow rate of oxidation and reductase activity toward the formation of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$.
2. Genetic deficiency (autosomal recessive) of one or both of the splice variants of methemoglobin reductase enzymes. The enzyme is reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH)-cytochrome b5 reductase (cytb5: E.C.1.6.2.2). Two splice variants, differing in the N -terminal region, are present: (a) a soluble form with 275 amino acids, and (b) a membrane-bound form with 300 amino acids. The membrane-bound form is present mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondrial outer membrane, where it is
important for a variety of reactions (i.e., synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, P-450-mediated drug metabolism). A deficiency in the soluble form of RBCs-usually caused by missense mutations that reduce enzyme stability-causes type I methemoglobinemia, which is usually not severe. A deficiency in the membrane-bound form causes type II methemoglobinemia, which can cause severe mental retardation and neurological problems. The type I disease can be treated with the reducing agents ascorbic acid and methylene blue, either singly or together.
3. Toxin-induced oxidation of the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ in Hb . Oxidation of the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ of Hb to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ can occur by three routes: (a) direct oxidation, promoted under hypoxic conditions; (b) indirect oxidation in the presence of bound $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, a mechanism that is important in the methemoglobinemia produced by nitrite; and (c) drug-induced oxidation, in which drug metabolites of compounds (e.g., aminobenzenes and nitrobenzenes) promote the oxidation.

represent $25 \%$ or more of the total Hb . Such a deficiency results in a decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-carrying capacity, leading to tissue hypoxia.

The environment provided by the globin portion of Hb is crucial for the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-heme interaction. To be useful, this interaction must be fully reversible under physiological conditions, allowing repetitive capture and release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The interaction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with free $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ normally produces $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$, the simplest example of which is rust. Even with isolated heme, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ irreversibly oxidizes $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ to $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$. However, when heme is part of Hb , interactions with $\sim 20$ amino acids cradle the heme in the globin, so that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ loosely and reversibly binds to $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$. The crucial residue is a histidine that bonds to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ and donates negative charge that stabilizes the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ complex. This histidine is also crucial for transmitting, to the rest of the Hb tetramer, the information that an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule is or is not bound to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$. When all four hemes are devoid of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, each of the four histidines pulls its $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ above the plane of its porphyrin ring by $\sim 0.06 \mathrm{~nm}$ (the blue conformation in Fig. 29-1C), distorting the porphyrin ring. Thus, the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$-histidine bond is under strain in deoxyhemoglobin, a strain that it transmits to the rest of the $\alpha$ or $\beta$ subunit, and thence to the rest of the Hb molecule. The various components of the Hb tetramer are so tightly
interlinked, as if by a snugly fitting system of levers and joints, that no one subunit can leave this tensed (T) state unless they all leave it together. Because the shape of the heme in the T state sterically inhibits the approach of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, empty Hb has a very low affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

When one $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to one of the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ atoms, the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ tends to move down into the plane of the porphyrin ring. If the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$ actually could move, it would flatten the ring and relieve the strain on the $\mathrm{Fe}^{2+}$-histidine bond. When enough $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules bind, enough energy builds up and all four subunits of the Hb simultaneously snap into the relaxed (R) state, whether or not they are bound to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. In this R state, with its flattened heme, the Hb molecule has an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity that is $\sim 150$-fold greater than that in the T state. Thus, when $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is zero, all Hb molecules are in the T state and have a low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity. When $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is very high, all Hb molecules are in the R state and have a high $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity. At intermediate $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values, an equilibrium exists between Hb molecules in the T and R states.

Myoglobin (Mb) is another heme-containing, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-binding protein that is specific for muscle (see p. 249). The globin portion of Mb arose in a gene duplication event from a primordial globin. Additional duplications along the non-Mb branch of the globin family led first to the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ chains of

# BOX 29-1 Forms of Hemoglobin 

The normal adult form of hemoglobin $\left(\alpha_{1} \beta_{1}\right)$, known as HbA, is only one of several normal forms that are present in prenatal or postnatal life. Some of these other hemoglobins contain naturally occurring $\alpha$-like chains (e.g., $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ ) or $\beta$-like chains (e.g., $\beta, \gamma, \delta$, and $\varepsilon$ ), whereas others reflect posttranslational modifications. Three genes for $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-like chains (all encoding 141 amino acids) cluster on chromosome 16: At the $5^{\prime}$ end of the cluster is one gene for a $\zeta$ chain, followed by two for the $\alpha$ chain. Pseudogenes for $\zeta$ and $\alpha$ are also present. Five genes for $\beta$-like chains (all encoding 146 amino acids) are clustered on chromosome 11: Starting at the $5^{\prime}$ end is one for $\varepsilon$, followed by two for $\gamma$ ( $\gamma_{2}$, encoding for glycine at position $136, \gamma_{4}$, for alanine), and one each for $\delta$ and $\beta$. A pseudogene for $\beta$ is also present. A locus control region regulates the expression of these $\beta$-like chains during development (see pp. 80-81).

The four prenatal hemoglobins (Table 29-1) consist of various combinations of two $\alpha$-like chains (e.g., $\alpha$ and $\zeta$ ) and two $\beta$-like chains (e.g., $\varepsilon$ and $\gamma$ ). Very early in life, when erythropoiesis occurs in the yolk sac, the hemoglobin products are the three embryonic hemoglobins. When erythropoiesis shifts to the liver and spleen at $\sim 10$ weeks' gestation, the hemoglobin product is fetal hemoglobin, or HbF ( $\alpha_{1} \gamma_{2}$ ). Erythrocytes containing HbF have a higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity than those containing HbA , owing to special properties of $\gamma$ chains. The newborn's blood contains both HbA and HbF ; the latter gradually falls by 1 year of age to the minute levels that are characteristic of the adult (rarely $>1 \%$ to $2 \%$ of total hemoglobin). With severe stress to the erythroid system-such as marked hemolysis (see p. 429), bone marrow failure, or recovery from bone marrow transplantation-immature erythroid precursors may be forced to mature before they have differentiated sufficiently to produce HbA. In these conditions, circulating levels of HbF may increase considerably. In some hereditary cases, normal HbF persists in the adult, with no clinically significant consequences.

Even adult blood contains several normal minor-component hemoglobins (Table 29-2), which account for $5 \%$ to $10 \%$ of the total blood hemoglobin. In $\mathrm{HbA}_{1}$ ( $\sim 2.5 \%$ of total hemoglobin), $\delta$ chains replace the $\beta$ chains of HbA . Although the physiological significance of $\mathrm{HbA}_{2}$ is unknown, the $\delta$ chains reduce the sickling of sickle hemoglobin (see below). Three other minor-component hemoglobins are the result of the nonenzymatic glycosylation of $\mathrm{HbA}, \mathrm{HbA}_{1 \alpha}, \mathrm{HbA}_{1 \varepsilon}$, and $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \gamma}$ form when intracellular glucose-8-phosphate reacts with the terminal amino groups of the $\beta$ chains of HbA . In poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, a disease characterized by decreased insulin or insulin sensitivity (see Box 51-5), blood glucose concentrations rise and, with them, intracellular concentrations of glucose-6-phosphate. As a result, glycosylated hemoglobins may represent $10 \%$ or more of the total hemoglobin. Because hemoglobin glycosylation is irreversible, and because the RBC has a mean lifetime of 120 days, levels of these glycosylated hemoglobins are clinically useful for assessing the long-term control of blood glucose levels in diabetics.

Numerous abnormal hemoglobins exist, most of which are caused by single-amino-acid substitutions on one of the polypeptide chains. One of the most clinically important is HbS , or sickle hemoglobin, in which a valine replaces the glutamate normally present at position 6 of the $\beta$ chain. Although oxygenated HbS has a normal solubility, deoxygenated HbS is only about half as soluble as deoxygenated HbA. As a result, in low- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ environments, HbS can crystallize into long fibers, giving the cells a sickle-like appearance. The sickled erythrocytes may disrupt blood flow in small vessels, causing many of the acute symptoms of "sickle cell crisis," including pain, renal dysfunction, retinal bleeding, and aseptic necrosis of bone. In addition, sickle cells are prone to hemolysis (mean lifetime, <20 days), which leads to a chronic hemolytic anemia.

Hb , and then to other $\alpha$-like and $\beta$-like chains (Box 29-1). Mb functions as a monomer, homologous to either an $\alpha$ or a $\beta$ chain of Hb . Although capable of binding only a single $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule, Mb has a much higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity than Hb . In the capillaries, Hb can thus hand off $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to an Mb inside a muscle cell; this Mb then transfers its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the next Mb , and so on, which speeds diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ through the muscle cell. Because of the low solubility of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, this action is essential: There is insufficient dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, by itself, to establish an intracellular $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gradient large enough to deliver adequate $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to mitochondria.

## The $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve has a sigmoidal shape because of cooperativity among the four subunits of the Hb molecule

Imagine that we expose whole blood (see pp. 429-431) to a gas phase with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ that we can set at any one of several values (Fig. 29-2). For example, we could incubate the blood with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg , typical of mixed-venous blood, and centrifuge a sample to separate plasma from erythrocytes, as one would for determining hematocrit (see pp. 102 and 429). Next, we could individually determine the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the plasma (i.e., dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ) and packed RBCs. If we know how much water is inside the RBCs, we can subtract the amount

Figure 29-3 Normal $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve. The $y$-axis on the right shows $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. For the red curve $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right.$ content of Hb$)$, we assume $15 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Hb} / \mathrm{dL}$ of blood and an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ capacity of $1.35 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{g} \mathrm{Hb}$. The brown curve is the sum of the red and purple curves. The $y$-axis on the left, which pertains only to the red curve, gives the percentage of Hb saturation or $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.
of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissolved in this water from the total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, arriving at the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to Hb .

Repeating this exercise over a range of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values, we obtain the red curve in Figure 29-3. The right-hand y-axis gives the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to Hb in the units $\left(\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right) /(\mathrm{dL}$ blood). The left-hand $y$-axis gives the same data in terms of percent $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathbf{S}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}\right.$ or "Sat"). To compute $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, we need to know the maximal amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that can bind to Hb at extremely high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values. Expressed in terms of grams of

Hb protein, this $\mathbf{O}_{2}$ capacity is $\sim 1.39 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{g} \mathrm{Hb}$ —assuming that no metHb is present. In real life, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ capacity may be closer to $1.35 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{g} \mathrm{Hb}$ because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ cannot bind to Hb that either is in the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ state (e.g., MetHb) or, as discussed below, is bound to carbon monoxide. We can translate this $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ capacity to a value for the maximal amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that can bind to Hb in 100 mL of blood. If the Hb content is $15 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Hb} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood (i.e., normal for an adult male), then

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Maximal } \mathrm{O}_{2} \text { bound to } \mathrm{Hb} \\
& \quad=\left(\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { capacity of } \mathrm{Hb}\right) \times(\mathrm{Hb} \text { content of blood }) \\
& \quad=\frac{1.35 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Hb}} \cdot \frac{15 \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{Hb}}{\mathrm{dL} \text { blood }} \\
& \quad=\sim 20.3\left(\mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}\right) / \mathrm{dL} \text { blood }
\end{aligned}
$$

The percent saturation of Hb is
\% Saturation of $\mathrm{Hb}=\frac{\mathrm{O}_{2}$ actually bound to Hb $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ capacity of Hb $\cdot 100$
Notice that the curve in Figure 29-3 is sigmoidal or S-shaped, owing to the cooperativity among the four $\mathrm{O}_{2^{-}}$ binding sites on the Hb molecule. At low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values, increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ produce relatively small increases in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding, which reflects the relatively low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb in the T state. At moderate $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values, the amount of bound $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases more steeply with increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which reflects the increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity as more Hb molecules shift to the R state. The $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at which the Hb is half saturated is known as the $\mathbf{P}_{98}$. Finally, the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ versus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ curve flattens at high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values as the Hb saturates. The difference in Hb saturation at low versus high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values is the basis for an important clinical tool, the pulse oximeter (Box 29-2).

At the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ prevailing in normal arterial blood $\left(\mathrm{Pa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ approximately 100 mm Hg -the Hb saturation $\left(\mathrm{Sa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ is $\sim 97.5 \%$ or $19.7 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ bound to Hb (Table 29-3). The dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (purple curve in Fig. 29-3) would add an additional $0.3 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ for a total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $20.0 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ (point $a$ on the brown curve in Fig. 29-3). In mixed-venous blood, in which $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ is $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, the Hb saturation $\left(\mathrm{SV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ is $\sim 75 \%$ or $15.2 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ bound to Hb (see Table 29-3). The dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would add 0.1 mL $\mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ for a total of $15.3 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ (point $\bar{v}$ in Fig. 29-3). The difference in total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content between points $a$ and $\bar{v}$, the $\mathrm{a}-\overline{\mathrm{v}}$ difference, is the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that the lungs add to the blood in the pulmonary capillaries, which is the same amount that all the tissues extract from the blood in the systemic capillaries:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{\mathrm{a}-\overline{\mathrm{v}}}{\text { difference for total } \mathrm{O}_{2} \text { content }} \quad \frac{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { content of arterial blood }}{\frac{20.0 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{dL} \text { blood }}} \cdot \frac{\mathrm{O}_{2} \text { content of mixed-venous blood }}{\frac{15.3 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{dL} \text { blood }}} \quad \frac{\overline{29-6)}}{29-6} \\
& \quad=\frac{4.7 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2}}{\mathrm{dL} \text { blood }}
\end{aligned}
$$

Of the total a- $\overline{\mathrm{v}}$ difference of $4.7 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}, \mathrm{Hb}$ provides $4.5 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ or nearly $96 \%$ of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that the lungs add and

# BOX 29-2 Measuring the Oxygen Saturation of Hb Clinically: The Pulse Oximeter 

The different colors of venous and arterial blood reflect difference in light absorbance between oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb . Clinicians now routinely exploit these differences to obtain simple, noninvasive measurements of the arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation $\left(\mathrm{Sa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of Hb in patients. The pulse oximeter has a probe that one attaches to the ear, finger, or any part of the body at which pulsating blood vessels are accessible externally. On one side of the pulsating vascular bed, the pulse oximeter shines red and infrared light; on the other side, it detects the light transmitted through the bed, and calculates absorbances. These total absorbances have two components: (1) a nonpulsatile component that arises from stationary tissues, including blood inside capillaries and veins; and (2) a pulsatile component that arises from blood inside arterioles and arteries. The difference between the total and nonpulsatile absorbance is thus the pulsatile component, which represents only arterial or oxygenated blood. Because oxygenated and deoxygenated Hb absorb red and infrared light differently, the pulse oximeter can calculate $\mathrm{Sa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ from the ratio of pulsatile light absorbed at the two wavelengths. The pulse oximeter accomplishes this magic by using a sophisticated microprocessor and software to produce
results that strongly agree with those provided by blood-gas analysis of a sample of arterial blood.

The pulse oximeter measures $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation in arterial blood. Because systemic capillaries and veins do not pulsate, they do not contribute to the measurement. Thus, a patient with peripheral cyanosis (e.g., purple fingertips caused by cold-induced vasoconstriction) may have a perfectly normal "central" (i.e., arterial) $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation. It is worth noting that pulse oximetry cannot detect CO poisoning because the absorbance spectra of $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{CO}$ and $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ are similar.

Health professionals widely employ pulse oximetry in hospitalized patients, particularly those in intensive care units, where continuous monitoring of $\mathrm{Sa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is critical. These patients include those on mechanical ventilators and others, less severely ill, who have some degree of respiratory compromise. Pulse oximetry has also become popular as an outpatient tool for assessing the presence of hypoxemia during sleep and thus screening for sleep apnea (Box 32-5). Because of the insidious nature of hypoxia, pilots of light aircraft have begun to use pulse oximeters to detect developing hypoxia at high altitudes.

the systemic tissues extract from blood (see Table 29-3). Is this a- $\overline{\mathrm{v}}$ difference in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content enough to satisfy the metabolic demands of the body (i.e., $\sim 250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}$ )? Using the Fick principle, as we did in Equation 29-3, we see that the combination of a cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and an $\mathrm{a}-\overline{\mathrm{v}}$ difference of $4.7 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ would be nearly adequate:
![bo78465312c5](bo78465312c5.jpg)

$$
=\sim 235 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}
$$

By either increasing cardiac output by $\sim 6 \%$ or decreasing the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood, the body could meet a demand of $250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}$. We spend our lives moving endlessly from point $a$ in Figure 29-3 to point $\overline{\mathrm{v}}$ (as we deliver $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues) and then back to point $a$ (as we take up more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from alveolar air).

Because the plot of $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ versus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is linear (see Fig. 29-3, purple curve), the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that can dissolve in blood plasma has no theoretical maximum. Thus, breathing $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ would raise arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by $\sim 6$-fold, so that $\sim 1.8 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would be dissolved in each deciliter of arterial blood.

Although dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would make a correspondingly greater contribution to overall $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carriage under such unphysiological conditions, Hb would still carry the vast majority of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Hence, a decrease in the Hb content of the blood-known as anemia-can markedly reduce $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carriage. The body can compensate for decreased Hb content in the same two ways that, in the above example, we increased the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ from 235 to $250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}$. First, it can increase cardiac output. Second, it can increase $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction, thereby reducing mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. Anemia leads to pallor of the mucous membranes and skin, reflecting the decrease in the red Hb pigment. Impaired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery may cause lethargy and fatigue. The accompanying increase in cardiac output may manifest itself as palpitations and a systolic murmur. Shortness of breath may also be a part of the syndrome.

If decreased Hb levels are detrimental, then increasing Hb content should increase the maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content and thus provide a competitive advantage for athletes. Even in normal individuals, $[\mathrm{Hb}]$ in RBC cytoplasm is already extremely high (see p. 434). Hypoxia (e.g., adaptation to high altitude) leads to the increased production of erythropoietin (see pp. 431-433), 19-2 a hormone that somewhat increases the amount of Hb per erythrocyte, but especially increases their number. Indeed, a few instances have been highly publicized in the international press in which elite athletes have

# N29-2 Interactions of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$with Hemoglobin 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Like most proteins, Hb has many titratable groups. However, the ones that are most important physiologically are the ones whose pK values are near the physiological pH . For a general discussion of buffers, consult the passage beginning on pages 628-633. Of particular interest is the passage dealing with buffers in a closed system (see pp. 630-633) and Figure 28-2B.

Several titratable groups in the Hb molecule contribute to the pH -Bohr effect. The most important single group is the histidine at residue 146 of the $\beta$ chains. When the Hb molecule is fully deoxygenated (tensed state), the protonated His-146 forms a salt bridge with the negatively charged aspartate group at position 94 of the same $\beta$ chain. This salt bridge stabilizes the protonated form of His-146, so that it has a high affinity for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(i.e., a relatively high pK value of $\sim 8.0$ ).

When the Hb becomes fully oxygenated (relaxed state), the twisting of the Hb molecule disrupts the salt bridge and thus destabilizes the protonated form of His-146, so that it has a low affinity for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and thus a relatively low $\mathrm{p} K$ value of $\sim 7.1$. This $\mathrm{p} K$ is roughly the same as the pH inside the RBC. According to Equation 28-5, the ratio $\left[\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]$ must be $1: 1$ (so that in 50 out of every 100 Hb molecules, this group is protonated).

Now let us fully deoxygenate this Hb and return the pK of His-146 to where it was at the beginning of this example, $\sim 8.0$.

The pH inside the erythrocyte remains at 7.1. Equation 28-5 tells us that the ratio $\left[\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}\right] /\left[\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right]$ will be $8: 1$. That is, in 89 of every 100 Hb molecules, this His-146 group is protonated. Thus, for every 100 Hb molecules, $39 \mathrm{H}^{+}$ions have been taken up from the solution to titrate $39 \mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ groups to form 39 additional $\mathrm{R}-\mathrm{NH}_{4}^{+}$groups at His-146.

The above is an extreme example, because the Hb does not become fully deoxygenated in the systemic capillaries. It is also a simplified example, inasmuch as multiple residues in Hb contribute to the pH -Bohr effect. Nevertheless, the example illustrates how deoxygenated Hb is better able to buffer excess protons.

In the above paragraphs, we have been emphasizing one side of the physiological coin: deoxygenation makes Hb a weaker acid (and thus causes Hb to take up $\mathrm{H}^{+}$). However, as summarized by the reaction in Equation 29-9,

$$
\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightleftarrows \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)_{2}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2}
$$

( $\mathbf{N E} \mathbf{2 9 - 1}$ )
the converse is also true: the protonation of Hb lowers Hb's affinity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

infused themselves with erythrocytes or injected themselves with recombinant erythropoietin. However, an excessive increase in hematocrit-polycythemia-has the adverse effect of increasing blood viscosity and thus vascular resistance (see pp. 437-439). The consequences include increased blood pressure in both the systemic and pulmonary circulations and a mismatch of ventilation to perfusion within the lung. Such a ventilation-perfusion mismatch leads to hypoxia (see p. 693), and thus desaturation of arterial Hb. Thus, the optimal hematocrit-presumably $\sim 45 \%$-is one that achieves a high maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content, but at a reasonable blood viscosity.

The purplish color of desaturated Hb produces the physical sign known as cyanosis, a purplish coloration of the skin and mucous membranes. Cyanosis results not from the absence of saturated or oxygenated Hb , but from the presence of desaturated Hb . Thus, an anemic patient with poorly saturated Hb might have too little unsaturated Hb for it to manifest as cyanosis. The physician's ability to detect cyanosis also depends on other factors, such as the subject's skin pigmentation and the lighting conditions for the physical examination.

## Increases in temperature, $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$, and $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$, all of which are characteristic of metabolically active tissues, cause Hb to dump $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

Metabolically active tissues not only have a high demand for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, they also are warm, produce large amounts of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and are acidic. Indeed, high temperature, high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and low pH of metabolically active tissues all decrease the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb by acting at nonheme sites to shift the equilibrium between the T and R states of Hb more toward the lowaffinity T state. The net effect is that metabolically active tissues can signal Hb in the systemic capillaries to release more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than usual, whereas less active tissues can signal Hb to release less. In the pulmonary capillaries-where temperature is lower than in active tissues, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is relatively low and pH is high-these same properties promote $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by Hb .

Temperature Increasing the temperature causes the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve to shift to the right, whereas decreasing the temperature has the opposite effect (Fig. 29-4). Comparing the three $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curves in Figure 29-4 at the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood ( 40 mm Hg ), we see that the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to Hb becomes progressively less at higher temperatures. In other words, high temperature decreases the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb and leads to release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. One mechanism of this temperature effect may be small shifts in the $\mathrm{p} K$ values of various amino-acid side chains, which cause shifts in net charge and thus a conformational change.

The maximal temperature achieved in active muscle is $\sim 40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Of course, very low temperatures can prevail in the skin of extremities exposed to extreme cold.

Acid In 1904, Christian Bohr, a physiologist and father of atomic physicist Niels Bohr, observed that respiratory acidosis (see p. 633) shifts the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve to the right (Fig. 29-5A). This decrease in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity has come to be known as the Bohr effect. A mild respiratory acidosis

Figure 29-4 Effect of temperature changes on the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve.
occurs physiologically as erythrocytes enter the systemic capillaries. There, the increase in extracellular $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to enter erythrocytes, which leads to a fall in intracellular pH (see p. 646). Other acidic metabolites may also lower extracellular and, therefore, intracellular pH . Thus, this intracellular respiratory acidosis has two componentsa decrease in pH and an increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. We now appreciate that both contribute to the rightward shift of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve observed by Bohr.

The effect of acidosis per se on the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-5B)-the $\mathbf{p H}$-Bohr effect-accounts for most of the overall Bohr effect. One can readily demonstrate the pH -Bohr effect in a solution of Hb by imposing a metabolic acidosis (e.g., decreasing pH at a fixed $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ). It should not be surprising that Hb is sensitive to changes in pH because Hb is an outstanding $\mathrm{H}^{+}$buffer (see p. 630):

$$
\mathrm{Hb}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Although Hb has many titratable groups, the ones important here are those with $\mathrm{p} K$ values in the physiological pH range. (5) N29-2 As we acidify the solution, raising the ratio $\left[\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{H}^{+}\right] /[\mathrm{Hb}]$ for susceptible groups, we change the conformation of the Hb molecule, thus lowering its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity:

$$
\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)_{2}+4 \mathrm{O}_{2}
$$

This is an extreme example in which we added enough $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ to cause Hb to dump all of its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Under more physiological conditions, the binding of $\sim 0.7$ mole of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$causes Hb to release 1 mole of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. This property is important in the systemic tissues, where $\left[\mathrm{H}^{+}\right]$is high. The converse is also true: $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding causes a conformational change in the Hb molecule, which lowers the affinity of Hb for $\mathrm{H}^{+}$.

![bo81465312c5](bo81465312c5.jpg)

Carbon Dioxide The isolated effect of hypercapnia per se on the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-5C) represents a small portion of the overall Bohr effect. Demonstrating such a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Bohr effect requires that we study the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb at a fixed pH , increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ proportionally-an example of isohydric hypercapnia (see p. 641). As $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ combines with unprotonated amino groups on $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ to form carbamino groups

(Hb-NH- $\mathrm{COO}^{-}$). (C) N29-3 Although Hb has other amino groups, only the four amino termini of the globin chains are susceptible to appreciable carbamino formation, the $\beta$ chains more so than the $\alpha$ chains. Because amino groups exist in a protonated form $\left(\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}\right)$in equilibrium with an unprotonated form, the reaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ tends to shift Hb away from the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}$form and toward the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}$form:

# N29-3 Interactions of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with Hemoglobin 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

As discussed on page $653, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can reversibly react with the four amino groups that constitute the four N termini of the globin chains-the two $\alpha$ chains and, especially, the two $\beta$ chains. As shown by Equation 29-10 in the text, the interaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with these amino termini causes the net charge on the residue to change from positive $(\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH})_{2}^{+}$to negative ( $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-$ COO ). A consequence is the formation of salt bridgesamong several positively and negatively charged amino-acid residues-that tend to stabilize the deoxygenated (or tensed) form of Hb . Thus, in the systemic capillaries, the increased levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ favor the deoxygenated form of Hb , which is tantamount to dumping $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. In other words, increased levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ cause the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve to shift to the right (see Fig. 29-5C).

In the lungs, the converse takes place as the binding of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to Hb causes a twisting of the Hb molecule as it shifts from the tensed to the relaxed state. This twisting disrupts the aforementioned salt bridges and destabilizes carbamino. As a result, the Hb molecule dumps $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which exits the erythrocyte and diffuses into the alveolar air space.

![bo84465312c5](bo84465312c5.jpg)

The overall effect of carbamino formation is therefore a negative shift in the charge on one amino-acid side chain, causing a shift in the conformation of Hb and reducing its $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity:

$$
\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4} \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \rightleftharpoons\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{3} \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{O}_{2}+2 \mathrm{H}^{+}
$$

Thus, an increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes Hb to unload $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is important in the systemic tissues. Conversely, an increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ causes Hb to unload $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which is important in the lungs.

In conclusion, the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve shifts to the right under conditions prevailing in the capillaries of metabolically active systemic tissues-increased temperature (see Fig. 29-4), decreased pH (see Fig. 29-5B), and increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Fig. 29-5C). These right shifts are synonymous with decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity. Thus, high metabolic rates promote the unloading of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from Hb . Clearly, blood cannot unload $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ unless the blood gets to the tissues. Indeed, in most systemic arterioles, local hypercapnia and acidosis also are powerful stimuli for vasodilation (see p. 556), enhancing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to metabolically active tissues.

## 2,3-Diphosphoglycerate reduces the affinity of adult, but not of fetal, Hb

The affinity of Hb for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is very sensitive to the presence of the glycolytic metabolite 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3DPG) (5) N29-4 and, to a lesser extent, organic phosphates such as ATP. The concentration of 2,3-DPG is about the same as that of Hb . Indeed, 2,3-DPG binds to Hb in a $1: 1$ stoichiometry, interacting with a central cavity formed by the two $\beta$ chains. At physiological $\mathrm{pH}, 2,3$-DPG has an average of $\sim 3.5$ negative charges, which interact with eight positively charged amino-acid residues in this central cavity. $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding, however, changes the shape of the central cavity, destabilizing DPG-bound Hb. As a result, deoxygenated Hb has a 100 -fold higher affinity for 2,3-DPG than does oxygenated Hb . Conversely, binding of 2,3-DPG to Hb destabilizes the interaction of Hb with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, promoting the release of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ :

$$
\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}+2,3-\mathrm{DPG} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{Hb}(2,3-\mathrm{DPG})+4 \mathrm{O}_{2}
$$

The result is a right shift in the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (Fig. 29-6). This effect of 2,3-DPG on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb is important both in hypoxia and in understanding the physiology of fetal Hb .

Decreasing the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of RBCs stimulates glycolysis, which leads to increased levels of 2,3-DPG. Indeed, chronic hypoxia, anemia, and acclimation to high altitude are all associated with an increase in 2,3-DPG levels and thus lower the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb . Reducing the affinity is a two-edged sword. At the relatively high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in alveoli, where the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve is fairly flat, this decrease in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity reduces $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake-but only slightly. At the low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in systemic tissues, where the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve is steep, this

decrease in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity markedly increases the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ release. The net effect is enhanced $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ unloading to metabolizing tissues, which is more important than $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ per se.

In Figure 29-7, the teal $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve represents pure or "stripped" Hb (i.e., in the absence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, 2,3$ DPG, and other organic phosphates). The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of pure Hb is quite high, as evidenced by the left shift of the curve. Adding only $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (orange curve) or only 2,3-DPG (green curve) to the solution shifts the curve somewhat to the right, and adding both yields the brown curve, which is indistinguishable from the red curve for intact RBCs under physiological conditions.

The fetal hemoglobin (HbF) in fetal erythrocytes (see p. 649) has a higher $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity than the Hb inside adult RBCs $(\mathrm{HbA})$. This difference is crucial for the fetus, whose blood must extract $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from maternal blood in the placenta (see p. 1137). The difference in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinities does not, however, reflect differences in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinities of stripped $\mathrm{HbA}$ and HbF , which are nearly identical. The crucial difference is that the $\gamma$ chains of HbF bind 2,3-DPG less avidly than do the $\beta$ chains of HbA . With less 2,3-DPG bound, the dissociation curve of HbF is left-shifted, similar to the HbA curve labeled " $\mathrm{Hb}+\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ " in Figure 29-7.
$\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is not the only gas that can bind to the $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}$ of Hb ; carbon monoxide (CO), nitric oxide (NO), and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ can also bind to Hb and snap it into the R state. (5) N29-5 In CO poisoning (see pp. 1224-1225), CO binds to Hb with an affinity that is $\sim 200$-fold greater than that of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thus, the maximal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ capacity falls to the extent that CO binds to Hb . However, the major reason that CO is toxic is that, as it snaps Hb into the R state, CO increases the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb and

# N29-4 2,3-DPG 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

2,3-Diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), also known as 2,3bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG), is an intermediate in one of the later reactions in glycolysis (Fig. 58-64). The overall reaction in question is 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) $\rightarrow$ 2-phosphoglycerate (2-PG), catalyzed by phosphoglycerate mutase (PGM):

$$
2-\mathrm{PG} \xrightarrow{\text { PGM }} 3-\mathrm{PG}
$$

The actual mechanism is interesting. A specific kinase initially activates the PGM by transferring a phosphate group from the 2 position of 2,3-DPG to a histidine residue of the enzyme, creating PGM-P and 3-PG:

In the actual mutase reaction, this activated enzyme transfers the phosphate group to 2-PG, creating 2,3-DPG:

$$
3-\mathrm{PG}+\mathrm{PGM}-\mathrm{P} \rightarrow 2,3-\mathrm{DPG}+\mathrm{PGM}
$$

Finally, the enzyme can accept a phosphate group from 2,3DPG, creating 3-PG:

$$
2,3-D P G+P G M \rightarrow 2-P G+P G M-P
$$

Thus, 2,3-DPG is a cofactor in the mutase reaction. It also is continuously formed and consumed.

# N29-5 Other Gases That Bind to Hemoglobin 

## Contributed by Arthur DuBois, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

The text discusses in some detail the interaction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with Hb , briefly discusses the interaction of CO with Hb , and mentions the interactions of NO and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~S}$ with Hb .

## Carbon Monoxide

As noted in the text, the affinity of Hb for CO is $\sim 200$-fold greater than for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thus, when a fully oxygenated Hb molecule$\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{4}$-is exposed to even a low level of CO , a CO molecule displaces one of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules from some of the Hb molecules, resulting in $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)_{2}(\mathrm{CO})$. If the only effect of CO poisoning were to render ineffective one of the four $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-binding sites, then the symptoms would be no worse than reducing the hematocrit by $25 \%$ (e.g., from $40 \%$ to $30 \%$ ) or perfusing the arteries with mixed-venous blood (which also has an $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturation of $75 \%$ ). If fact, if a single CO molecule binds to $40 \%$ of the Hb molecules in the blood, the patient will experience symptoms, as outlined below. Why?

## Basis of CO Toxicity

CO is toxic for two reasons. First, it reduces the number of binding sites available for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carriage. Second, the binding of CO stabilizes the Hb molecule in its relaxed state, which shifts the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve far to the left and makes it more difficult for the Hb to release $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the systemic capillaries.

## Calculating the CO Saturation of Hb

To calculate the HbCO concentration, remember that when the Hb is exposed to CO , the [HbCO] will equal the $\left[\mathrm{HbO}_{2}\right]$ when the Hb is exposed to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at 210 times the [CO] in question. For example, Hb is $50 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (at equilibrium) when the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is 28 mm Hg . The $50 \% \mathrm{HbCO}$ concentration will be reached at equilibrium with $28 / 210 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ which would be only 0.133 mm Hg of CO . Because an atmosphere of pressure is $760 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}, 0.133 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ of CO is equivalent to $0.133 / 760$ or 0.000175 atmosphere of CO , or 175 ppm of CO . This level of CO would severely incapacitate or kill a person exposed to it for a long time. However, because it takes 4 hours to reach half the final equilibrated level of HbCO , a 4 -hour exposure to 175 ppm alveolar CO would lead to a HbCO level of $50 \% / 2$, or $25 \% \mathrm{HbCO}$. This level would give the person a headache and interfere with mental function. In 2 hours of exposure, the HbCO would be $1 / 4$ of $50 \%$ saturation, or $12.5 \% \mathrm{HbCO}$. This lower level would interfere with night vision and-because of some interference with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport-raise the risk of angina in a person with limited coronary blood flow.

## Symptoms and Treatments

Symptoms of mild CO poisoning may begin when the CO saturation of Hb reaches $10 \%$; that is, when $40 \%$ of the Hb molecules bind one $\mathrm{CO}(25 \%$ of sites on one Hb molecule $\times 40 \%$ of Hb molecules $=10 \%$ saturation). These symptoms-which are not very specific-may include headache, nausea, and vomiting.

For mild CO poisoning, the treatment is simply to remove the causative agent, which leaves the body with a half-time of $\sim 4$ hours (i.e., CO dissociates very, very slowly from Hb -it has a low off-rate).

For more severe CO poisoning, the recommended treatment is to have the patient breathe $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, which increases the probability that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ will displace CO from Hb (i.e., it increases the off-rate) and thereby speeds the washout of CO by about a factor of 4 (half-time $\cong 60$ minutes).

When the CO saturation of Hb reaches $20 \%$ to $25 \%$ (i.e., when, on average, $80 \%$ to $100 \%$ of Hb molecules each bind one CO molecule), the symptoms are severe and include confusion, chest pain, and unconsciousness. The treatment is hyperbaric $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$-oxygen delivered at high pressure (OHP)—which has two positive effects. First, the hyperbaric $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (i.e., increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ) accelerates even further the displacement of CO from Hb . Breathing hyperbaric $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ at 2.5 atmospheres of pressure reduces the half-time of washout to 20 minutes. Second, the hyperbaric- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ treatment can increase the concentration of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to such an extent that this dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the blood can deliver sufficient $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to satisfy the body's metabolic demands (see Equations 29-1 through 29-3).

CO reaches a lethal level at an Hb saturation of $\sim 50 \%$.
Interestingly, hyperventilation is not an effective treatment for CO poisoning. One reason for this lack of effect may be that hyperventilation blows off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and reduces the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see pp. 679-680). According to the Bohr effect, low levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (e.g., caused by hyperventilation) would shift the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve to the left, exacerbating the effect of the CO poisoning. In fact, Yandell Henderson showed that use of $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in $95 \%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ decreased plasma pH , which accelerated the displacement of CO from HbCO as well as increasing the tissue $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ through the Bohr effect (communicated by Arthur DuBois).

## Nitric Oxide

Hb also binds NO. This interaction may help ensure that the effects of NO are paracrine rather than endocrine-that is, that the effects of NO are restricted to the sites of release. The physiological target of NO is soluble guanylyl cyclase (see pp. 66-67), which binds NO through a heme group, just as does Hb !

The teal, orange, green, and brown curves are $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curves for pure $\mathrm{Hb}(2 \mathrm{mM})$ in artificial solutions. "Stripped Hb" is devoid of both $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and 2,3-DPG. When $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or 2,3-DPG was present, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ was 40 mm Hg and $[2,3-\mathrm{DPG}]$ was 2.4 mM . The cytosol of erythrocytes in blood (red curve) had the same composition as the artificial solutions.
shifts the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve far to the left. Thus, when Hb reaches the systemic capillaries in CO poisoning, its tenacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is so high that the bright red blood cannot release enough $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues.

## CARRIAGE OF $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

## Blood carries "total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ " mainly as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$

The blood carries $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and related compounds in five forms: (5) N29-6

1. Dissolved carbon dioxide. $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\text {dis }}$ follows Henry's law (see p. 593), and it is in the millimolar range in both blood plasma and blood cells. It makes up only $\sim 5 \%$ of the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ of arterial blood (gold portion of leftmost bar in Fig. 29-8).
2. Carbonic acid. $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ can form either from $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, or from $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see p. 630). Because the equilibrium constant governing the reaction $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ $\rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is $\sim 0.0025,\left[\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right]$ is only $1 / 400$ th as large as $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$. Thus, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is not quantitatively important for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ carriage.
3. Bicarbonate. $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$can form in three ways. First, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ can dissociate into $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Second, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ can combine directly with $\mathrm{OH}^{-}$to form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, the reaction catalyzed by carbonic anhydrase. (5) N18-3 Third, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ forms when carbonate combines with $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. In arterial blood, $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is $\sim 24 \mathrm{mM}$, so that $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$represents $\sim 90 \%$ of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (purple portion of leftmost bar in Fig. 29-8).
4. Carbonate. $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ forms from the dissociation of bicarbonate: $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}^{+}$. Because the $\mathrm{p} K$ of this reaction is so high $\left(\sim 10.3\right),\left[\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right]$ is only $\sim 1 / 1000$ th as high as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$at $\mathrm{pH} 7.4$. Thus, like $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}, \mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ is not quantitatively important for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ carriage.

Figure 29-8 Constituents of "total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in blood." The left bar (a) represents arterial blood; the middle bar ( $\bar{v}$ ), mixed-venous blood; and the right bar, the incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that the blood picks up in the systemic capillaries.
5. Carbamino compounds. By far the most important carbamino compound is carbamino hemoglobin ( $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-$ $\mathrm{COO}^{-}$), which forms rapidly and reversibly as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ reacts with free amino groups on Hb (see p. 653). In arterial blood, carbamino compounds account for $\sim 5 \%$ of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (blue) portion of leftmost bar in Fig. 29-8).

The reason we group together the previously listed five $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-related compounds under the term total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is that the method Van Slyke (5) N29-7 introduced in the 1920s-which remains the basis for assaying blood $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in modern clinical laboratories-cannot distinguish among the five.

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport depends critically on carbonic anhydrase, the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger, and Hb

The total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration of arterial blood is $\sim 26 \mathrm{mM}$, or $\sim 48 \mathrm{~mL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas/dL (measured at STP). $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$constitutes $\sim 90 \%$ of this $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and carbamino compounds contributing $\sim 5 \%$ each (bar $a$ in Fig. 29-8). As blood courses through the systemic capillary beds, it picks up $\sim 4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, so that the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ of mixed-venous blood is $\sim 52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (bar $\bar{v}$ in Fig. 29-8). In what forms does blood carry this incremental $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to the lungs? About $10 \%$ of the incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ moves as dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $\sim 69 \%$ as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and $\sim 21 \%$ as carbamino compounds (rightmost two bars in Fig. 29-8). Therefore, dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and carbamino $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are far more important for carrying incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to the lungs than we might have surmised, given their contribution to total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in arterial blood.

Figure 29-9 summarizes the events that occur as incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters systemic capillaries. As fast as biological oxidations in the mitochondria produce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, this gas diffuses out of cells, through the extracellular space, across the

## N29-7 Van Slyke's Manometric Method for Determining Total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In 1924, Van Slyke and Neill introduced a technique for determining what is today known as the "total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ " of blood $\mathbf{0}$ N29-6 and other solutions. This technique quickly became the standard for determining total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in clinical chemistry laboratories. Moreover, the Van Slyke approach is the foundation even for modern, automated approaches for determining total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

Although the original approach requires painstaking precision in the laboratory in order to obtain reliable results, the fundamental principle is a rather simple two-step process. First, one uses an acid (Van Slyke and Neill used 1 N lactic acid) to titrate virtually all of the carbamino Hb , carbonate $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}\right)$, and bicarbonate $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$ to carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$, which enters the gaseous phase. Second, one uses a manometer to measure the pressure $(P)$ of a known volume $(V)$ of this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas. The ideal gas law tells us that

$$
P V=n R T
$$

$(\mathrm{NE} 29-2)$
Here, $n$ is the number of molecules, $R$ is the universal gas constant, and $T$ is the absolute temperature. Thus, with the proper corrections for nonideality, it is possible to compute the number of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules.

We will now examine the titration reactions in a little more detail. For the titration of carbamino Hb by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in lactic acid, two reactions occur in series:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{CO}_{2} \\
& \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{2}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}_{3}^{+}
\end{aligned}
$$

These reactions are the reverse of the ones shown in Equation 29-10.

The titration of $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$ by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in lactic acid yields $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$:

$$
\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \quad(\mathrm{NE} 29-4)
$$

Finally, the titration of this newly formed $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$-as well as the pre-existing $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(which is a far larger amount under physiological conditions)-by the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$in lactic acid yields carbonic acid $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}\right)$, which in turn yields $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ :

$$
\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{H}^{+} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \quad(\mathrm{NE} 29-5)
$$

Because the pK governing the equilibrium $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ is $\sim 2.6,>99.7 \%$ of the newly formed $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$ goes on to form $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

In practice, the technique used to generate the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas also extracts a variable amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the solution. In other words, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the gas phase is mixed with an amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that is difficult to predict. Therefore, Van Slyke and Neill introduced an additional step to their analysis: they added 1 N NaOH to convert all total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{CO}_{3}^{2-}$, thereby removing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the gas phase. This last step allowed them to obtain, with precision, the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas in the gas phase and thus to calculate the amount of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that had been in their sample.

Figure 29-9 Carriage of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from systemic capillaries to the lungs.
capillary endothelium, and into the blood plasma. Some of the incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}(\sim 11 \%)$ remains in blood plasma throughout its journey to the lungs, but most ( $\sim 89 \%$ ), at least initially, enters the RBCs.

The $\sim 11 \%$ of the incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in plasma travels in three forms:

1. Dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. About $6 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ remains dissolved in blood plasma (assuming a hematocrit of $40 \%$ ).
2. Carbamino compounds. An insignificant amount forms carbamino compounds with plasma proteins.
3. Bicarbonate. About $5 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ in the plasma and remains in the plasma: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow$ $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. The amount of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$that follows this path depends critically on non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ buffering power (see pp. 637-638), which is very low in plasma ( $\sim 5 \mathrm{mM} / \mathrm{pH}$ unit).

The remaining $\sim 89 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters the RBCs, predominantly through two "gas channels," aquaporin 1 (AQP1) and the Rh complex. 0 N25-8 This $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ also has three fates:

1. Dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. About $4 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ remains dissolved inside the RBC.
2. Carbamino compounds. About $21 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms carbamino compounds with Hb . Why does so much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ travel as carbamino compounds inside the RBC, whereas so little does in the blood plasma? First, the Hb concentration inside RBCs ( $\sim 33 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) is far higher than that of albumin and globulins in plasma ( $\sim 7 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

Second, Hb forms carbamino compounds far more easily than do major plasma proteins. Moreover, Hb forms carbamino compounds even more easily as it loses $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the systemic capillaries (reverse of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Bohr effect). Finally, Hb is a far better buffer than the plasma proteins for the $\mathrm{H}^{+}$formed as a byproduct in carbamino formation, and becomes an even better buffer as it loses $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the systemic capillaries (reverse of the pH -Bohr effect).
3. Bicarbonate. About $64 \%$ of the incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ forms $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Why does so much more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ form $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$in the erythrocyte than in plasma? First, erythrocytes contain a high level of carbonic anhydrases (see p. 434), (1) N18-3 which greatly accelerates the conversion of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. In the absence of enzyme, hardly any $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ would form inside erythrocytes during the brief time that the cells spend during their passage through a typical systemic capillary. Second, the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger AE1 (see pp. 124-125 and 434-435) transports some of the newly formed $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$out of the cell, promoting formation of more $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. This uptake of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$in exchange for $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ is known as the chloride or Hamburger shift. Third, the buffering of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$by Hb (see point 2 above) also pulls the reaction to the right.

The combined effects of the described intracellular and extracellular events is that $\sim 10 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ formed in systemic tissues moves to the lungs as dissolved $\mathrm{CO}_{2}, 6 \%$ in plasma and $4 \%$ inside erythrocytes (gold portion of rightmost bar in Fig. 29-8). About $21 \%$ moves as carbamino compounds, almost exclusively inside erythrocytes as carbamino

# N29-8 Gas Channels 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

The traditional view had been that all gases cross all cell membranes by simply dissolving in the lipid phase of the membrane. The first evidence that the gas dogma was in need of refinement was the observation that apical membranes of gastric gland cells are impermeable to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ (Waisbren et al, 1994) and that apical membranes of colonic crypts are impermeable to $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ (Singh et al, 1995). Low permeabilities to gases and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ may be a general property of membranes facing inhospitable environments (Cooper et al, 2002), including the mechanical stresses experienced by RBCs and capillary endothelial cells. Cells exposed to such hostile environments may have evolved specialized, robust membranes with unique lipid composition or protein or oligosaccharide coatings at the membrane surface.

The second observation that upset the gas dogma was the discovery that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ passes through the water channel AQP1 (Cooper et al, 1998; Nakhoul et al, 1998). Peter Agre shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for discovering AQPs and their $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ permeability. (5) N5-7 The physiological role of AQPs transcends water. For example, AQP7 and AQP9 transport glycerol. Might AQP1's $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ permeability be physiologically relevant? The first such evidence was the demonstration that an AQP plays a critical role in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ uptake for photosynthesis by tobacco leaves (Uehlein et al, 2003). Endeward and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that approximately half of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ entering human RBCs passes through the AQP1 channel.

The AQPs form homotetramers, and each monomer has a pore for $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ could pass single file with $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ through each of the four aquapores as well as through the central pore between the four monomers (Wang et al, 2007). Preliminary inhibitor studies from the Boron laboratory confirm this prediction, indicating that $\sim 40 \%$ of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that passes through AQP1 moves through the four aquapores, whereas the remaining $60 \%$ passes through the central pore. The molecular dynamics simulations suggest that virtually all of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ passes through the central pore.

A second family of gas channels is the Rh proteins. The bacterial Rh homolog AmtB forms a homotrimer, and each monomer appears to have a pore for $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$. The RhAG protein from the human Rh complex in RBCs is permeable both to $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ and to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Endeward et al, 2008). Preliminary work from the Boron laboratory indicates that $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ moves exclusively through one of the three ammonia pores, whereas $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ moves mainly through the central pore of both AmtB and RhAG.

Interestingly, gas channels exhibit selectivity for gas in much the same way as ion channels exhibit selectivity for ions. For example, AQP4 (heavily expressed at the blood-brain barrier) and AQP5 (heavily expressed in alveolar type I pneumocytes) are virtually totally selective for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ over $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$. AQP1 (heavily expressed in RBCs) is intermediate in its $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{NH}_{2}$ selectivity, AmtB is shifted more toward $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ selectivity, and RhAG (heavily expressed in RBCs) is even more shifted toward selectivity for $\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ over $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. This work is the first evidence for gas selectivity by a protein channel (Musa-Aziz et al, 2009).

Figure 29-10 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves (Haldane effect).

Hb (blue portion of rightmost bar in Fig. 29-8). Finally, $\sim 69 \%$ of incremental $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ moves as $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}, 5 \%$ that forms in plasma and $64 \%$ that forms inside the RBC (purple portion of rightmost bar in Fig. 29-8). Because $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ enters the cell during $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$formation, erythrocytes swell as they pass through systemic capillaries.

When mixed-venous blood (with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) reaches the pulmonary capillaries (surrounded by alveoli with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of only $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ moves from the erythrocytes and blood plasma into the alveolar air space. All of the reactions discussed above reverse. In the process, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$and $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ leave the erythrocytes, and the cells shrink.

## The high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the lungs causes the blood to dump $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$

The carriage of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the blood depends on the three blood-gas parameters- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, plasma pH , and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The three plots in the main portion of Figure 29-10 are $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves. Each plot shows how changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ affect the total- $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of blood. Although pH per se does not appear in this diagram, pH decreases as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases along the x -axis (i.e., respiratory acidosis; see p. 833). The blue plot is the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve when $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is zero ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 0 \% \mathrm{Hb}$ ). The next two plots are $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values of $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 75 \% ;\right.$ purple curve) and 100 mm Hg ( $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 97.5 \%$; red curve). The green line at the bottom of Figure 29-10 shows that the dissolved component of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ rises only slightly with increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

Three features of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves in Figure 29-10 are noteworthy:

1. Near-linear relationship in the physiological range of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values (see Fig. 29-10, inset). In contrast, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve is highly nonlinear in its physiological range (i.e., 40 to 100 mm Hg ).
2. Up-shift of curve with decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. At any $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content rises as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (or Hb saturation) falls-the Haldane effect. (5) N29-9 Thus, as blood enters systemic capillaries and releases $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-carrying capacity rises so that blood picks up extra $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Conversely, as blood enters the pulmonary capillaries and binds $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-carrying capacity falls so that blood dumps extra $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Table 29-4). The Haldane effect is the flip side of the coin from the pH -Bohr and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Bohr effects. First, just as $\mathrm{H}^{+}$binding lowers the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb (see Equation 29-9), $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding destabilizes protonated hemoglobin $\left(\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$, promoting $\mathrm{H}^{+}$release. By mass action, this $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ reduces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-carrying capacity by favoring the formation of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from both carbamino Hb and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$(see Fig. 29-9). Second, just as carbamino formation lowers the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ affinity of Hb (see Equation 29-11), $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binding destabilizes carbamino $\mathrm{Hb}\left(\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{NH}-\mathrm{COO}^{-}\right)$, promoting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ release.
3. Steepness. Because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curves (see Fig. 29-10) are much steeper than $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curves (see Fig. 29-3), $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ must increase from 40 mm Hg in arterial blood to only 46 mm Hg in mixed-venous blood to increase the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content by the $\sim 4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ required to remove $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as fast as the mitochondria produce it. In contrast, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ must decrease from 100 to 40 mm Hg to dump enough $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to meet metabolic demands.

In the inset to Figure 29-10, point $a$ on the red curve represents arterial blood, with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 97.5 \%\right)$. Point $\bar{v}$ on the purple curve represents mixed-venous blood, with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 46 mm Hg but a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of only $40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \cong 75 \%\right)$. The difference between the total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contents represented by the two points (i.e., 52 versus $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) represents the $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ the blood takes up as it passes through systemic capillaries. If it

# N29-9 John Scott Haldane 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

John Scott Haldane (1860-1936) was born in Edinburgh, where he received his medical degree in 1884. He began his academic career at Queen's College, Dundee, before moving to Oxford. Haldane is credited with several notable discoveries.

- He showed that high blood levels of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are a more powerful stimulus for breathing than low levels of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (1905).
- He developed a method for the staged decompression of deep-sea divers to avoid the bends on the return of the divers to the surface. He published the first diving decompression tables (1908).
- He—along with Christiansen and Douglas—showed that the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood decreases with increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{Sc}}$, known as the Haldane effect (1914). This effect is responsible for about half of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ exchange in the blood.

were not for the Haldane effect, the blood would remain on the red curve, and the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increase would cause the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content to increase by only $\sim 2.7 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thus, at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 46 mm Hg , the fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ that occurs as blood flows through systemic capillaries allows the blood to pick up $\sim 50 \%$ more $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., 4 versus $2.7 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). Viewed differently, if it were not for the Haldane effect, mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would have to increase to $\sim 49 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ for blood to carry $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Table 29-4 summarizes how changes in blood parameters can influence the amount of total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that the blood is able to carry.

## The $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram describes the interaction of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the blood

We have seen that Hb plays a key role in transporting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the lungs to peripheral tissues, transporting $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the
opposite direction, and buffering $\mathrm{H}^{+}$. These functions are all intimately interrelated: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH influence the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{Hb}$ dissociation curve (Bohr effects; see Fig. 29-5), and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ influences the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve (Haldane effect; see Fig. 29-10). A useful way of illustrating this mutual dependence is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram, which we will revisit on page 691 to understand regional differences between alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

On a coordinate system with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ on the $y$-axis and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ on the x -axis, each blue curve in Figure 29-11 represents an isopleth of identical $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content in whole blood (from the Greek isos [equal] + plethein [to be full]). For example, arterial blood (point $a$ ) lies on the isopleth for an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $20.0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, with coordinates of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Following this isopleth from a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg (point $a$ ) to, say, 46 mm Hg , we see that the blood could carry the same $20.0 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ only if we increase

$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ from 100 to nearly 105 mm Hg . Thus, as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of blood decreases (Bohr effect). If it were not for the Bohr effect, all the blue curves would be vertical lines. Mixed-venous blood (point $\vec{v}$ ) is on the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-content isopleth for $15.3 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 46 mm Hg . If blood were equilibrated with inspired air (point $I$ ), it would have a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 150 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of zero.

Each red curve is an isopleth of identical $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content. Arterial blood (point $a$ ) lies on the isopleth for $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Similarly, mixed-venous blood (point $\vec{v}$ ) lies on the isopleth for $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Following this $52-\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ isopleth from a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg (point $\vec{v}$ ) to, say, 100 mm Hg , we see that the blood could carry the same $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ only if we
increase $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 46 to nearly 50 mm Hg . Thus, as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of blood decreases (Haldane effect). If it were not for the Haldane effect, all the red curves would be horizontal lines. Blood equilibrated with inspired air (point $I$ ) would have a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of zero.

In Figure 29-11, the green curve connecting the points $\vec{v}, a$, and $I$ represents all possible combinations of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in normal lungs.

# GAS EXCHANGE IN THE LUNGS 

Walter F. Boron

The complex anatomy of the pulmonary tree, the mechanics of the respiratory system, and the sophisticated carriage mechanisms for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ combine to serve two essential purposes: the ready diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the alveoli to the pulmonary-capillary blood, and the movement of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the opposite direction. In this chapter, we consider principles that govern these diffusive events and factors that, in certain diseases, can limit gas exchange.

## DIFFUSION OF GASES

## Gas flow across a barrier is proportional to diffusing capacity and concentration gradient (Fick's law)

Although, early on, physiologists debated whether the lung actively secretes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the blood, we now know that the movements of both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across the alveolar blood-gas barrier occur by simple diffusion (see p. 108). Random motion alone causes a net movement of molecules from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. Although diffusion per se involves no expenditure of energy, the body must do work-in the form of ventilation and circulation-to create the concentration gradients down which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuse. Over short distances, diffusion can be highly effective.

Suppose that a barrier that is permeable to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ separates two air-filled compartments (Fig. 30-1A). The partial pressures (see p. 593) of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on the two sides are $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{2}$. The probability that an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule on side 1 will collide with the barrier and move to the opposite side is proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ :

$$
\text { Flow }_{1 \rightarrow 2} \propto \mathrm{P}_{1}
$$

The unidirectional movement of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the opposite direction, from side 2 to side 1 , is proportional to the partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on side 2 :

$$
\text { Flow }_{2 \rightarrow 1} \propto \mathrm{P}_{2}
$$

The net movement of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from side 1 to side 2 is the difference between the two unidirectional flows:

$$
\text { Flow }_{\text {net }}=\left(\mathrm{P}_{1}-\mathrm{P}_{2}\right)
$$

Note that net flow is proportional to the difference in partial pressures, not the ratio. Thus, when $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ is 100 mm Hg (or torr) and $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ is 95 mm Hg (ratio of 1.05 ), the net flow is 5 -fold greater than when $\mathrm{P}_{1}$ is 2 mm Hg and $\mathrm{P}_{2}$ is 1 mm Hg (ratio of 2 ).

The term flow describes the number of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecules moving across the entire area of the barrier per unit time (units: moles/s). If we normalize flow for the area of the barrier, the result is a flux (units: moles $/\left[\mathrm{cm}^{2} \cdot \mathrm{~s}\right]$ ). Respiratory physiologists usually measure the flow of a gas such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ as the volume of gas (measured at standard temperature and pressure/dry; see Box 26-3) moving per unit time. V refers to the volume and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ is its time derivative (volume of gas moving per unit time), or flow.

The proportionality constant in Equation 30-3 is the diffusing capacity for the lung, $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (units: $\mathrm{mL} /[\mathrm{min} \cdot \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}]$ ). Thus, the flow of gas becomes

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {net }}=\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{P}_{1}-\mathrm{P}_{2}\right)
$$

This equation is a simplified version of Fick's law (see p. 108), which states that net flow is proportional to the concentration gradient, expressed here as the partial-pressure gradient.

Applying Fick's law to the diffusion of gas across the alveolar wall requires that we extend our model somewhat. Rather than a simple barrier separating two compartments filled with dry gas, a wet barrier covered with a film of water on one side will separate a volume filled with moist air from a volume of blood plasma at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (see Fig. 30-1B). Now we can examine how the physical characteristics of the gas and the barrier contribute to $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$.

Two properties of the gas contribute to $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$-molecular weight (MW) and solubility in water. First, the mobility of the gas should decrease as its molecular weight increases. Indeed, Graham's law states that diffusion is inversely proportional to the square root of molecular weight. Second, Fick's law states that the flow of the gas across the wet barrier is proportional to the concentration gradient of the gas dissolved in water. According to Henry's law (see Box 26-2), these concentrations are proportional to the respective partial pressures, and the proportionality constant is the solubility of the gas (s). Therefore, poorly soluble gases (e.g., $\mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{He}$ ) diffuse poorly across the alveolar wall.

Figure 30-2 Effect of barrier thickness.

Two properties of the barrier contribute to $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$-area and thickness. First, the net flow of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is proportional to the area (A) of the barrier, describing the odds that an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ molecule will collide with the barrier. Second, the net flow is inversely proportional to the thickness (a) of the barrier, including the water layer. The thicker the barrier, the smaller the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partialpressure gradient $\left(\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} / \mathrm{a}\right)$ through the barrier (Fig. 30-2). An analogy is the slope of the trail that a skier takes from a mountain peak to the base. Whether the skier takes a steep "expert" trail or a shallow "beginner's" trail, the end points
of the journey are the same. However, the trip is much faster along the steeper trail!

Finally, a combined property of both the barrier and the gas also contributes to $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$, a proportionality constant $k$ that describes the interaction of the gas with the barrier.

Replacing $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ in Equation 30-4 with an area, solubility, thickness, molecular weight, and the proportionality constant yields

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {net }}=\underbrace{\left[k \frac{\mathrm{~A} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{a} \sqrt{\mathrm{MW}}}\right]}_{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{I}}-\mathrm{P}_{2}\right)
$$

Equations 30-4 and 30-5 are analogous to Ohm's law for electricity:

$$
\mathrm{I}=\left(\frac{1}{\mathrm{R}}\right) \cdot \Delta \mathrm{V}
$$

Electrical current (I) in Ohm's law corresponds to the net flow of gas ( $\mathrm{V}_{\text {net }}$ ); the reciprocal of resistance (i.e., conductance) corresponds to diffusing capacity $\left(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$; and the voltage difference $(\Delta \mathrm{V})$ that drives electrical current corresponds to the pressure difference $\left(\mathrm{P}_{1}-\mathrm{P}_{2}\right.$, or $\left.\Delta \mathrm{P}\right)$.

## The total flux of a gas between alveolar air and blood is the summation of multiple diffusion events along each pulmonary capillary during the respiratory cycle

Equation 30-5 describes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion between two compartments whose properties are uniform both spatially and temporally. Does this equation work for the lungs? If we assume that the alveolar air, blood-gas barrier, and pulmonarycapillary blood are uniform in space and time, then the net diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}\left(\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ from alveolar air to pulmonary-capillary blood is

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\underbrace{k \frac{\mathrm{~A} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{a} \sqrt{\mathrm{MW}}}}_{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}}
$$

Figure 30-3 Complications of using Fick's law.
$\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressure in the alveolar air, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the comparable parameter in pulmonary-capillary blood. Although Equation 30-7 may seem sophisticated enough, a closer examination reveals that $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ are each even more complicated than they at first appear.
$\mathrm{DL}_{0_{2}}$ Among the five terms that make up $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, two vary both temporally (during the respiratory cycle) and spatially
![bo94465312c5](bo94465312c5.jpg)
(from one piece of alveolar wall to another). During inspiration, lung expansion causes the surface area (A) available for diffusion to increase and the thickness of the barrier (a) to decrease (Fig. 30-3A). Because of these temporal differences, $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ should be maximal at the end of inspiration. However, even at one instant in time, barrier thickness and the surface area of alveolar wall differ among pieces of alveolar wall. These spatial differences exist both at rest and during the respiratory cycle. (T) N30-1

# N30-1 Spatial Differences in Alveolar Dimensions 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The total area of the lungs is not distributed evenly among all alveoli. First, all else being equal, some alveoli are "naturally" larger than others. Thus, some have a greater area for diffusion than do others, and some have a thinner wall than do others.

Second, the position of an alveolus in the lung can affect its size. As we saw in Chapter 27, when a person is positioned vertically, the effects of gravity cause the intrapleural pressure to be more negative near the apex of the lung than near the base (see Fig. 27-2). Thus, other things being equal, alveoli near the apex of the lung tend to be more inflated, so that they have a greater area and smaller thickness compared to alveoli near the base of the lung.

Third, during inspiration, alveoli undergo an increase in volume that causes their surface area to increase and their wall thickness to decrease. However, these changes are not uniform among alveoli. Again, the differences can be purely anatomical: all other things being equal, some alveoli "naturally" have a greater static compliance (see p. 610) than others. Thus, during inspiration, their area will increase more, and their wall thickness will decrease more. However, other things being equal, the compliance of an alveolus also depends on its position in the lung. We will see in Chapter 31 that the relatively overinflated alveoli near the apex of the lung (in an upright individual) have a relatively low compliance. In other words, during inspiration these apical alveoli have a smaller volume increase (see Fig. 31-5D). Thus, their area for diffusion undergoes a relatively smaller increase, and their wall thickness undergoes a relatively smaller decrease, than alveoli near the base of the lung.

In summary, for all of the reasons we have discussed, the area and thickness parameters vary widely among alveoli at the end of a quiet inspiration, and the relation among these differences changes dynamically during a respiratory cycle.

$\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{B}_{4}}$ Like area and thickness, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ varies both temporally and spatially (see Fig. 30-3B). In any given alveolus, $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is greatest during inspiration (when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-rich air enters the lungs) and least just before the initiation of the next inspiration (after perfusion has maximally drained $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the alveoli), as discussed on page 676. These are temporal differences. We will see that when an individual is standing, $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is greatest near the lung apex and least near the base (see pp. 681-682). Moreover, mechanical variations in the resistance of conducting airways (see pp. 681-682) and the compliance of alveoli (see p. 597 or pp. 608-610) cause ventilation-and thus $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see p. 610)-to vary among alveoli. These are spatial differences.
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{B}_{4}}}$ As discussed below, as the blood flows down the capillary, capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rises to match $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see Fig. 30-3C). Therefore, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion is maximal at the beginning of the pulmonary capillary and gradually falls to zero farther along the capillary. Moreover, this profile varies during the respiratory cycle.

The complications that we have raised for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion apply as well to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion. Of these complications, by far the most serious is the change in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}$ with distance along the pulmonary capillary. How, then, can we use Fick's law to understand the diffusion of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ? Clearly, we cannot insert a single set of fixed values for $\mathrm{Di}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}$ into Equation 30-7 and hope to describe the overall flow of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ between all alveoli and their pulmonary capillaries throughout the entire respiratory cycle. However, Fick's law does describe gas flow between air and blood for a single piece of alveolar wall (and its apposed capillary wall) at a single time during the respiratory cycle. For $\mathrm{O}_{2}$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \text { for one piece } \\
& \text { of alveolar wall, } \\
& \text { at one time }
\end{aligned}=\underbrace{k \frac{\mathrm{~A} \cdot \mathrm{~s}}{\mathrm{a} \sqrt{\mathrm{MW}}}}_{\mathrm{Di}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}} \quad\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}\right)
$$

For one piece of alveolar wall and at one instant in time, A and a (and thus $\mathrm{Di}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ) have well defined values, as do $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}$. The total amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ flowing from all alveoli to all pulmonary capillaries throughout the entire respiratory cycle is simply the sum of all individual diffusion events, added up over all pieces of alveolar wall (and their apposed pieces of capillary wall) and over all times in the respiratory cycle:

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\sum_{\substack{\text { wall } \\ \text { to }}}^{\text {All pieces }} \sum_{\text {to }}^{\text {All times }} \sum_{\text {clyde }}^{\left(\mathrm{DI}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}\right)\right.}
$$

Here, $\mathrm{Di}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}$ are the "microscopic" values for one piece of alveolar wall, at one instant in time.

Even though the version of Fick's law in Equation 30-9 does indeed describe $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from alveolar air to pulmonary-capillary blood-and a comparable equation would do the same for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffusion in the opposite direction-it is not of much practical value for predicting $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake. However, we can easily compute the uptake of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ that has already taken place by use of the Fick principle (see p. 423). The rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the lungs is the difference between the rate at which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ leaves the lungs via the
pulmonary veins and the rate at which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ enters the lungs via the pulmonary arteries. The rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ departure from the lungs is the product of blood flow (i.e., cardiac output, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ) and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of pulmonary venous blood, which is virtually the same as that of systemic arterial blood $\left(\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$. Remember that "content" (see p. 650) is the sum of dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ bound to hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$. Similarly, the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery to the lungs is the product of $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of pulmonary arterial blood, which is the same as that of the mixed-venous blood $\left(\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$. Thus, the difference between the rates of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ departure and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ delivery is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { For a cardiac output of } 5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}, \text { a } \mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \text { of } 20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL} \\
& \text { blood, and a } \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \text { of } 15 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL} \text { blood, the rate of } \mathrm{O}_{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
=250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}
$$

For a cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, a $\mathrm{Ca}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $20 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood, and a $\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $15 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ blood, the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by the pulmonary-capillary blood is

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { The flow of } \mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO} \text {, and } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { between alveolar air and } \\
& \text { blood depends on the interaction of these gases } \\
& \text { with red blood cells }
\end{aligned}
$$

The flow of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between alveolar air and blood depends on the interaction of these gases with red blood cells

We have been treating $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport as if it involved only the diffusion of the gas across a homogeneous barrier. In fact, the barrier is a three-ply structure (5) N30-2 comprising an alveolar epithelial cell, a capillary endothelial cell, and the intervening interstitial space containing extracellular matrix. The barrier is remarkable not only for its impressive surface area ( 50 to $100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ ) and thinness ( $\sim 0.6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ ) but also for its strength, which derives mainly from type IV collagen in the lamina densa of the basement membrane (often $<50 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) within the extracellular matrix.

One could imagine that, as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses from the alveolar air to the Hb inside an erythrocyte (red blood cell, or RBC), the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ must cross 12 discrete mini-barriers (Fig. 30-4). A mini-diffusing capacity ( $\mathrm{D}_{1}$ to $\mathrm{D}_{12}$ ) governs each of the 12 steps and contributes to a so-called membrane diffusing capacity $\left(\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{m}}\right)$ because it primarily describes how $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses

Figure 30-4 Transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from alveolar air to Hb . The 12 diffusion constants $\left(D_{1}\right.$ to $\left.D_{12}\right)$ govern 12 diffusive steps across a series of 12 barriers: (1) the interface between the alveolar air and water layer, (2) the water layer itself, (3-5) the two membranes and cytoplasm of the type I alveolar pneumocyte (i.e., epithelial cell), (6) the interstitial space containing the extracellular matrix, (7-9) the two membranes and cytoplasm of the capillary endothelial cell, (10) a thin layer of blood plasma ( $<0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in mammals), and $(11,12)$ the membrane and cytoplasm of the erythrocyte. $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ describes how fast $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to Hb .
through various membranes. How do these mini-diffusing capacities contribute to $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ ? Returning to our electrical model (see Equation 30-6), we recognize that D is analogous to the reciprocal of resistance. Therefore, we can represent the 12 diffusive steps by 12 resistors in series. Because the total resistance is the sum of the individual resistances, the reciprocal of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ is the sum of the reciprocals of the minidiffusing capacities:

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{1}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{2}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{3}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{10}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{11}}+\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{12}}
$$

Of course, these parameters vary with location in the lung and position in the respiratory cycle.

For most of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ entering the blood, the final step is binding to Hb (see p. 647), which occurs at a finite rate:

Rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake by hemoglobin $=\left(\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right) \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$
$\theta$ is a rate constant that describes how many milliliters of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ gas bind to the Hb in 1 mL of blood each minute, and for each millimeter of mercury ( mm Hg ) of partial pressure. $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is the volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries. The product $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ has the same dimensions as $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ (units: $\mathrm{mL} /[\min \cdot \mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg}]$ ), and both contribute to the overall diffusing capacity:

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}}=\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}}+\frac{1}{\theta \cdot \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

Because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ binds to Hb so rapidly, its "Hb" term $1 /\left(\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ is probably only $\sim 5 \%$ as large as its "membrane" term $1 / \mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$.

For carbon monoxide (CO), which binds to Hb even more tightly than does $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see pp. 654-655)-but far more slowly- $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is quantitatively far more important. The overall uptake of CO , which pulmonary specialists use to
compute $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (see p. 670), depends about equally on the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ and $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ terms.

As far as the movement of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is concerned, one might expect the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to be substantially higher than that for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, inasmuch as the solubility of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in water is $\sim 23$-fold higher than that of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see p. 593). However, measurements show that $\mathrm{Dt}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is only 3 - to 5 -fold greater than $\mathrm{Dt}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The likely explanation is that the interaction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ with the RBC is more complicated than that of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, involving interactions with Hb , carbonic anhydrase, and the $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchanger (see pp. 655-657).

In summary, the movement of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the alveolus and the pulmonary capillary involves not only diffusion but also interactions with Hb . Although these interactions have only a minor effect on the diffusing capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, they are extremely important for CO and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Although we will generally refer to "diffusing capacity" as if it represented only the diffusion across a homogeneous barrier, one must keep in mind its more complex nature.

## DIFFUSION AND PERFUSION LIMITATIONS ON GAS TRANSPORT

## The diffusing capacity normally limits the uptake of CO from alveolar air to blood

Imagine that a subject breathes air containing $0.1 \% \mathrm{CO}$ for a brief period of time. Breathing somewhat higher levels of CO for many hours could be fatal (see pp. 1224-1225) because CO , which binds to Hb with an affinity that is 200 to 300 times higher than that of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, prevents Hb from releasing $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the tissues (see pp. 655-657). If we assume that barometric pressure ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}$ ) is 760 mm Hg and that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is 47 mm Hg at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, then we can compute the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ of the wet inspired air entering the alveoli (see Box 26-1):

![bo96465312c5](bo96465312c5.jpg)

Figure 30-5 Diffusion of CO. In $\mathbf{A}, \Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is the CO partial-pressure gradient from alveolar air to pulmonarycapillary blood. As the RBC enters the capillary, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ occupies three of the four sites on Hb . In $\mathbf{B}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. In $\mathbf{C}$, the blood flow $\dot{\mathrm{O}}$ has a relative value of 1 . In $\mathbf{D}$, the diffusing capacity D , has a relative value of 1. Because $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is very low in $\mathbf{B}$ through $\mathbf{D}$, we are on the linear portion of the Hb-CO dissociation curve. Thus, the CO content at the end of the capillary is approximately proportional to the capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}} & =\stackrel{\text { Fraction of inspired }}{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{CO}}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{~Pa}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right) \\
& =0.1 \% \cdot(760-47) \mathrm{mmHg} \\
& =-0.7 \mathrm{mmHg}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the subject smokes cigarettes or lives in a polluted environment, CO will be present in the mixed-venous bloodand, therefore, the alveolar air-even before our test begins. If not, the initial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ of the mixed-venous blood entering the pulmonary capillaries will be $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, a small gradient ( $\sim 0.7 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) drives CO diffusion from alveolar air into blood plasma (Fig. 30-5A). As CO enters the blood plasma, it diffuses into the cytoplasm of RBCs, where Hb binds it avidly. The flow of CO from alveolus to RBC is so slow, and the affinity and capacity of Hb to bind CO is so great, that Hb binds almost all incoming CO. Because only a small fraction of the total CO in the pulmonary-capillary blood remains free in solution, the aqueous phase of the blood remains nearly a perfect sink for CO. That is, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ in the capillary $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}\right)$, which is proportional to free $[\mathrm{CO}]$ in the capillary, rises only slightly above 0 mm Hg as the blood
courses down the capillary (see Fig. 30-5B). Thus, by the time the blood reaches the end of the capillary ( $\sim 0.75$ second later), $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ is still far below alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right)$. In other words, CO fails to reach diffusion equilibrium (c) N30-3 between the alveolus and the blood.

There are two reasons that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ rises so slowly as blood flows down the pulmonary capillary:

1. The CO flux $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right)$ is low. According to Fick's law, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}=$ $\mathrm{Dt}_{\mathrm{CO}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}\right)$. Because we chose to use an extremely low inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ driving CO diffusion was likewise extremely low, causing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ to rise slowly. In addition, the physiological $\mathrm{Dt}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is moderate.
2. Hb continuously traps incoming CO. Hb has a high affinity and high capacity for CO. Thus, for a low $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{a}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$-proportional to the free [CO]-rises very slowly.

We will now explore factors that influence how much CO the blood takes up as it flows down the capillary. The principles that we develop here apply equally well to $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. First, we use the Fick principle (see Equation 30-10) to quantitate, after the fact, how much CO has entered the blood:

# N30-3 An Analogy for the Diffusion-Limited Uptake of CO 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The following may be a helpful analogy for how the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right)$ changes with time as blood flows down a pulmonary capillary. Keep in mind that, if the linear velocity of the blood is constant, time corresponds to distance down the capillary as shown on the x-axis in Figure 30-5B. Imagine a basement that is somewhat leaky to water. The leakiness of the wall is analogous to the diffusing capacity $\left(D_{L}\right)$ of the lung. After a severe rainstorm, the water outside the basement rises to a level that is 100 cm above the floor of the basement. This 100 cm of water is analogous to the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. The combination of the hydrostatic pressure gradient of 100 cm and the leakiness of the wall allow water to leak in at the rate of $100 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, the influx of water is analogous to the uptake of CO by the pulmonarycapillary blood $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{C} O}\right)$. Fortunately, the basement is equipped with a sump pump-activated by the presence of water-that removes water at $99 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. The sump pump is analogous to Hb , and the pumping of the water is analogous to the binding of CO to Hb . Thus, under the conditions of this example, the pump can remove all but $1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ of the incoming water, so that water level (analogous to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ ) will slowly rise. By how much will the water level rise within 5 hours, a period that is analogous to the time that an RBC spends in a pulmonary capillary?

If the leakiness of the basement wall is low (low $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ), then the water level may rise by only a few centimeters over the 5 -hour period. Thus, even though a large amount of water may have
entered during the 5 hours, the basement water level never rose enough to equilibrate with the outside water level, which was 100 cm above the floor. The reason for this failure of the water to equilibrate is that the pump was able to remove almost all the water. If the leakiness of the basement wall is higher (higher $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ), then the water level after 5 hours may be 50 cm -but still less than the water level outside the wall.

It is important to recognize that the failure of the water to equilibrate across the wall in our examples was not a function of the water per se but of three parameters: (1) the relatively low leakiness of the basement wall (low $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ), (2) the modest $100-\mathrm{cm}$ pressure gradient driving water across the wall into the basement (low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ ), and (3) the high capacity of the pump for removing water (CO binding capacity of Hb ). Obviously if the wall were substantially leakier, if the pressure gradient were substantially higher, or if the pump were substantially slower, the water level in the basement could have risen to as much as 100 cm during the 5 -hour period-but never more. However, given low driving pressure and the high pump capacity, the total amount of water that entered the basement during the 5 -hour period was limited by the leakiness of the basement wall. If the leakiness had been twice as great, the amount of water entering the basement during the 5 -hour period also would have been twice as great. Thus, the entry of water was leakiness limited.

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}=\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}^{\prime \prime}-\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}^{\prime}\right)
$$

Overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is the total flow of CO along the entire length of all capillaries throughout the lungs, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is cardiac output, $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ is the CO content of blood at the end of the pulmonary capillary (dissolved and bound to Hb ), and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ is the CO content of mixed-venous blood at the beginning of the capillary. If we assume that $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ is zero, then Equation 30-17 simplifies to

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}=\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}^{\prime}
$$

Of course, this overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, computed from the Fick principle, must be the same as the sum of the individual diffusion events, computed from Fick's law (analogous to Equation 30-12):

How does CO uptake depend on $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ? For basal conditions, we assume that $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ each have relative values of 1 and that the curve labeled " $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}=1$ " in Figure 30-5C describes the trajectory of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$. As a result, $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ also has a relative value of 1 . According to the Fick principle, the total amount of CO moving into the blood along the capillary is

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}} & =\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}^{\prime} \\
& =1 \cdot 1 \\
& =1
\end{aligned}
$$

What would happen if we kept $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ constant, but doubled $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ ? Fick's law (see Equation 30-19) predicts that the flow of CO into the blood for each diffusion event along the capillary would double. Thus, along the entire capillary, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ would rise twice as steeply (see Fig. 30-5C, curve labeled " $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ $=2$ ") as before. As a result, $\bigcirc \mathrm{N} 30-4 \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ and thus $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would also double.

Reducing $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ by half would have the opposite effect: $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ and thus $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would also halve (see Fig. 30-5C, bottom curve). Therefore, CO uptake is proportional to $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ over a wide range of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values (Table 30-1, upper half). Of course, if it were possible to make $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ extremely high, then capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would rise so fast that CO would equilibrate with the Hb before the end of the capillary, and capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would reach alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ (see Fig. 30-5C, top curve). However, for realistic values of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$-as well as low alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ levels and normal Hb concentrations- CO would fail to reach equilibrium by the end of the capillary.

How would alteration of blood flow affect $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ ? If $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ were halved and the dimensions of the capillary remained constant, then the contact time of the blood with the alveolar capillary would double. Thus, at any distance down the capillary, twice as much cumulative time would be available for CO diffusion. The trajectory of capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ versus distance would be twice as steep (see Fig. 30-5D, curve labeled

The values in the table are all relative to "control" values of unity. $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ CO content of the blood at the end of the capillary; $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$, diffusing capacity; $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$, diffusing capacity of the lungs for CO ; $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$, cardiac output; $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, overall rate of CO uptake by the pulmonary-capillary blood.
" $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}=0.5$ ") as in the basal state (curve labeled " $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}=1$ "), and $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ would also be twice as great. However, because we achieved this increase in $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ by cutting $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in half, the product $\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \cdot \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}=\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would be the same as that in the basal state (see Table 30-1, lower half).

Doubling of blood flow would cause capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ to rise only half as steeply (see Fig. 30-5D, bottom curve) as in the basal state, but still would have no effect on $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. Thus, for the range of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ values in this example, CO uptake is unaffected by changes in blood flow. Of course, if we were to reduce $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to extremely low values, then capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ would reach alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ by the end of the capillary (see Fig. 30-5D, top curve).

In our example, we have assumed that the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ profile along the capillary is linear and that changes in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ do not affect capillary dimensions. (5) N30-5 In fact, these assumptions are not entirely valid. Nevertheless, the uptake of CO is more or less proportional to the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for CO , and rather insensitive to perfusion. Therefore, we say that the uptake of CO is diffusion limited because it is the diffusing capacity that predominantly limits CO transport. We can judge whether the transport of a gas is predominantly diffusion limited by comparing the partial pressure of the gas at the end of the pulmonary capillary with the alveolar partial pressure. If the gas does not reach diffusion equilibrium (i.e., if the end-capillary partial pressure fails to reach the alveolar partial pressure), then transport is predominantly diffusion limited. However, if the gas does reach diffusion equilibrium, then its transport is perfusion limited, as discussed next.

## Perfusion normally limits the uptake of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ from alveolar air to blood

Unlike CO, nitrous oxide ("laughing gas," $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) does not bind to Hb . Therefore, when a subject inhales $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, the gas enters the blood plasma and the RBC cytoplasm but has nowhere else to go (Fig. 30-6A). Consequently, as blood courses down the pulmonary capillary, the concentration of free $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$-and thus capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}}\right)$-rises very rapidly (see Fig. 30-6B). By the time the blood is $\sim 10 \%$ of the way along the capillary, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}}$ has reached alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$, and $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is thus in diffusion equilibrium between alveolus and blood. The reason $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reaches diffusion equilibriumwhereas CO does not-is not that its $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is particularly high, or that we chose a high inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$. The key difference is that Hb does not bind to $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$.

## N30-4 Assumptions Underlying Figure 30-5C

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In our analysis-in which we are halving or doubling $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$-we are assuming that $D_{L}$ is strictly a reflection of Fick's law. That is, we are assuming that $D_{L}$ equals $D_{M}$, and we are ignoring the buffering of CO by Hb .

In our example in which we have doubled $D_{L}$ (curve labeled " $D_{L}=2$ " in Fig. 30-5C), we showed that the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right)$ at the end of the pulmonary capillary has doubled. The CO content of the blood at the end of the pulmonary capillary $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}}\right)_{\mathrm{co}}$ also very nearly doubles. $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{C}} \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{co}}$ has two components, the CO freely dissolved in blood and the CO bound to Hb . The latter is by far the more important. At the low capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values in our example, the relationship between capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and the CO saturation of Hb is approximately linear. According to Henry's law, the relationship between $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and dissolved CO is also linear. Thus, the total CO content of blood at the end of the capillary is approximately proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ at the end of the capillary in our example. Thus, when $D_{L}$ doubles, both the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and the total CO content of the blood also double at the end of the pulmonary capillary.

## N30-5 Assumptions Underlying Figure 30-5D

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In analyzing Figure 30-5D, we have assumed that the linear velocity of the pulmonary-capillary blood is proportional to the flow $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$. Thus, when the flow doubles, we are assuming that the contact time of the blood with the alveolar capillary would fall by half.

This assumption requires that the dimensions of the vessel be fixed (i.e., that neither the diameter nor the length of the capillary increase) and that the increase in flow not recruit new blood vessels. In fact, as we shall see in Chapter 31, neither of these assumptions is correct. First, if we start from a low perfusion pressure, increasing the perfusion pressure causes the recruitment of pulmonary vessels that previously were not conducting blood. Second, pulmonary vessels are highly compliant, so that increases in perfusion pressure cause the vessels to dilate. For both reasons (i.e., recruitment and dilation), pulmonary vascular resistance falls as the perfusion pressure increases. Thus, if the flow doubles, the contact time of the blood with the alveolar capillary will fall, but by less than half.

Figure 30-6 Diffusion of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. In $\mathbf{B}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is alveolar $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{OO}}$ is capillary $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$. In $\mathbf{C}$, the blood flow $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ has a relative value of 1 . In $\mathbf{D}$, the diffusing capacity $D_{L}$ has a relative value of 1 . The $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content at the end of the capillary is proportional to $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$.

How does $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ uptake by the lungs depend on $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ? If we assume that the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content of the mixedvenous blood entering the pulmonary capillary $\left(\mathrm{CV}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$ is zero, then

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \cdot \mathrm{Cc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}^{\prime}
$$

$\mathrm{Cc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}^{\prime}$ is the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content of the blood at the end of the pulmonary capillary and represents entirely $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ physically dissolved in blood, which according to Henry's law (see Box $26-2$ ) is proportional to $\mathrm{Pc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$. The overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ computed from the Fick principle in Equation 30-21 is the sum of individual diffusion events along the capillary:

![bo98465312c5](bo98465312c5.jpg)

Because $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reached diffusion equilibrium at $\sim 10 \%$ of the way down the capillary (i.e., $\mathrm{Pc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}=\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ ), the
individual diffusion terms in Equation 30-22 equate to zero for the distal $90 \%$ of the capillary?

We can approach the uptake of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in the same way we did the uptake of CO. We begin, under basal conditions, with relative values of 1 for $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}, \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$, and end-capillary $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content $\left(\mathrm{Cc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}^{\prime}\right)$. Thus, the initial $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is $\dot{\mathrm{Q}} \times \mathrm{Cc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}^{\prime}=1$.

Figure 30-6C shows that doubling of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ doubles the flow of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the blood for each diffusion event, causing $\mathrm{Pc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ to rise twice as steeply as before along the capillary. However, even though this doubling of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ causes $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to come into diffusion equilibrium twice as fast as before, it has no effect either on the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content of end-capillary blood or on $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$, both of which remain at 1 . Cutting $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ in half also would have no effect on $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$. Thus, $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ uptake is insensitive to changes in $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ at least over the range of values that we examined (Table 30-2, upper half). In other words, the uptake of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ is not diffusion limited.

What would be the effect of reducing $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ by half while holding $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ constant? If we assume that capillary dimensions remain constant, then halving of $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ would double the contact time of blood with the alveolus and make the $\mathrm{Pc}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ trajectory along the capillary twice as steep as before (see

TABLE 30-2 Alveolar Transport of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$

|  | $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}}$ | $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ | $\times$ | $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}}$ | $=$ | $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ |

Fig. 30-6D). Nevertheless, $\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}}$ remains unchanged at 1 . However, because we reduced Q by half, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ also falls by half. Conversely, doubling of Q causes $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ to double. Thus, $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ uptake is more or less proportional to blood flow (i.e., perfusion) over a wide range of Q values (see Table 30-2, lower half). For this reason, we say that $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport is predominantly perfusion limited. The transport of a gas is predominantly perfusion limited if the gas in the capillary comes into equilibrium with the gas in the alveolar air by the end of the capillary.

## In principle, CO transport could become perfusion limited and $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport could become diffusion limited under special conditions

Although normally CO transport is diffusion limited and $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport is perfusion limited, changes in certain parameters could, at least in theory, make CO uptake perfusion limited, or make $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ uptake diffusion limited. To illustrate, we introduce an analogy (Fig. 30-7): workers at a railroad siding trying to load boxes (transport gas at a rate $\dot{\mathrm{V}}$ ) onto the cars of a passing train. Each worker (the diffusive event) has a limited rate for putting boxes on the train, and the total rate is the sum for all the workers $\left(D_{L}\right)$. Each railway car (the RBC) has a limited capacity for holding boxes, and the total capacity is the sum for all cars (Hb concentration). Finally, because the train is moving (the perfusion rate, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ), a limited time is available to load each railway car.

First imagine that the speed of the train perfectly matches the number of workers (see Fig. 30-7A). Thus, all workers are always fully occupied, and the railway cars depart the siding fully loaded; the last box is put on each car just as the car leaves the siding. Any decrease in worker number, any increase in the carrying capacity of each car, or any increase in train speed causes the railway cars to leave the siding at least partially empty. Thus, if we fix train speed at "normal," decreasing the number of workers below "normal" (see Fig. 30-7B) would cause a proportional decrease in the shipping rate-the number of boxes the train carries away per hour. In other words, when the number of workers is between zero and normal, the shipping rate is worker (diffusion) limited.

Now return to the original "perfect-match" condition in which both worker number and train speed are normal. Increasing worker number at constant train speed has no effect on either the number of boxes loaded onto each railway car (which remain filled to capacity) or the shipping rate (see Fig. 30-7C). In this higher range of worker number, the shipping rate is no longer limited by the workers, but by the speed of the train or by the carrying capacity of the railway
cars. Thus, we could say that the shipping rate is speed (perfusion) limited, although it would be equally true to say that it is carrying-capacity $(\mathrm{Hb})$ limited.

Let us return again to the original condition in which worker number perfectly matches train speed. Increasing train speed while fixing worker number at the normal value causes railway cars to leave the siding partially empty (see Fig. 30-7D). However, shipping rate is unaffected because the normal number of boxes is simply distributed over a greater number of cars. Under these conditions, shipping rate is again worker (diffusion) limited because increasing the number of workers would proportionally increase shipping rate. In fact, whenever you see cars leaving the siding only partially filled, you can conclude that shipping rate is worker (diffusion) limited, regardless of whether this situation arose because of a decrease in worker number, an increase in train speed, or an increase in car carrying-capacity.

Finally, let us again return to the perfectly matched initial condition and now decrease train speed while holding worker number fixed at the normal value. As velocity decreases below normal, shipping rate decreases proportionally (see Fig. 30-7E), even though the railway cars leave the siding fully loaded. Thus, shipping rate is speed (perfusion) limited. It would be equally true to characterize the system as being limited by carrying capacity $(\mathrm{Hb})$. In fact, whenever you see cars leaving the siding fully filled, you can conclude that shipping rate is speed (perfusion) limited, regardless of whether this situation arose because of an increase in worker number, a decrease in train speed, or a decrease in car carrying capacity.

The reader is now in a position to consider factors that could render CO transport predominantly perfusion limited or $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ transport diffusion limited. Several changes to the system would cause CO transport to be no longer limited by $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. 3 N30-6 Conversely, several other changes would cause the transport of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to be no longer limited by $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$.

## The uptake of CO provides an estimate of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$

Because the pulmonary diffusing capacity plays such an important role in determining the partial-pressure profile of a gas along the pulmonary capillary, being able to measure $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would be valuable. Moreover, an approach that is easily applicable to patients could be useful both as a diagnostic tool and as a means to follow the progression of diseases affecting $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$.

We have already observed (see Equation 30-9) that we can use Fick's law to compute the overall uptake of a gas if we summate many individual diffusion events for all pieces of alveolar wall and all times in the respiratory cycle:

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {gas }}=\sum_{\substack{\text { wall }}}^{\substack{\text { All pieces } \\ \text { of alveolar } \\ \text { of alveolar }}} \frac{\text { All times }}{\text { in respiratory }}$
If we could ignore spatial and temporal nonuniformities, then we could eliminate the two troublesome $\Sigma$ symbols and compute an overall $\mathrm{DL}_{\text {gas }}$ from the overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\text {gas }}$. We could accommodate modest spatial and temporal variations in $\mathrm{PA}_{\text {gas }}$ by computing an average alveolar partial pressure

# N30-6 Making CO Uptake Perfusion Limited or Making $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ Uptake Diffusion Limited 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

After analyzing our railway car analogy, we are now in a position to consider factors that could-at least in principle-render the transport of CO predominantly perfusion limited, or that couldat least in principle-render the transport of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ predominantly diffusion limited. Let us first consider CO uptake.

At least six changes to the system (eTable 30-1) could cause pulmonary capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{rcO}}\right)$ to reach alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}\right)$ by the end of the capillary and thus cause CO transport no longer to be limited by $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.

1. Increase $\mathbf{D L}_{\mathbf{C O}}$ (i.e., increase the number of workers in the analogy of Fig. 30-7). This change would increase the flow of CO into the capillary for each diffusion event and thus increase both the rate at which the Hb would load up with CO and the rate at which free CO (proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ ) could accumulate in the capillary. Another way of increasing the flow of CO into the capillary would be to increase $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{C O}}$, which would increase the driving force for CO diffusion. Keep in mind that it is the product of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ that-according to Fick's law-determines diffusion.
2. Decrease (or totally eliminate) Hb (i.e., decrease the carrying capacity of each railway car). In the extreme, eliminating Hb would force all incoming CO to remain free in solution, so that free [CO] (i.e., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{rcO}}$ ) would rapidly rise along the pulmonary capillary.
3. Increase the CO content of mixed-venous blood (partially preload railway cars with dummy boxes before the cars enter the dock area). By partially loading the Hb with CO before the blood even came into contact with the alveoli, we would reduce the amount of additional CO that could bind to Hb before the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{CO}$ complex was in equilibrium with free CO. With fewer binding sites available for the CO diffusing in from the alveoli, the level of free CO would rise more rapidly. In the extreme, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{rcO}}$ would reach $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ by the end of the capillary.
4. Decrease $\dot{\mathbf{Q}}$ (decrease train speed). By increasing the contact time of capillary blood with the alveoli, we would allow each bolus of capillary blood to undergo more diffusion events as it moves a certain distance along the length of the capillary. Thus, for a given distance traveled along the capillary, the blood would take up more CO, more

CO would bind to Hb , and more CO also would remain free-so that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{rcO}}$ would more closely approach $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.
5. Lengthen the capillary (increase the length of the loading dock, with a proportional increase in the number of workers). The effect of this maneuver is the same as for point 4 above in that it increases the contact time of the blood with the pulmonary capillary.
6. Distend the capillary while keeping $\dot{\mathbf{Q}}$ constant (decrease train speed). In this case, we would decrease the linear velocity of the blood, increasing the contact time with the capillary. The effect, however, would not be quite as dramatic as that in point 4 because the increase in diameter would decrease the surface-to-volume ratio so that each bolus of blood would be able to avail itself of a smaller surface area for diffusion. Keep in mind that linear velocity will decrease with the square of the radius, whereas surface area will increase only linearly with area.
At least four changes to the system would cause the transport of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, normally perfusion limited, to become diffusion limited (eTable 30-2). In other words, capillary $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N} 2}$ would fail to reach alveolar $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N} 2}$ by the end of the pulmonary capillary.

1. The first is to greatly decrease $\mathbf{D L}_{\mathbf{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ (i.e., decrease the number of workers). The result will be to slow diffusion. In the extreme, we could decrease the flow of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ so much that the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ fails to achieve equilibrium by the end of the capillary. Another way of decreasing the flow of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ into the capillary would be to decrease $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$, which would decrease the driving force for $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ diffusion. Keep in mind that it is the product of $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N} 2}$ and $\mathbf{D L}_{\mathbf{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ that-according to Fick's law-determines diffusion.
2. Increase $\mathbf{Q}$ (increase train speed). An increase in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ increases the linear velocity of the blood and thus decreases the time available for $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ diffusion into a bolus of blood. If the increase in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is sufficiently large, then the amount of $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ diffusing into the lumen will be so small that capillary $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N} 2}$ will never reach alveolar $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{N} 2}$. That is, the contact time will be insufficient for $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ to achieve equilibrium.
3. Shorten the capillary (decrease the length of the loading dock). Like the increase in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$, the decrease in capillary

length will decrease the contact time for a bolus of blood with the pulmonary capillary.
4. Decrease capillary diameter while keeping $\dot{Q}$ constant (increase train speed). This maneuver would increase the linear velocity of the blood, decreasing the contact time of a bolus of blood with the capillary. The effect might be even more dramatic than that in point 2 because the decrease in diameter would increase the surface-to-volume ratio so that
each bolus of blood would be able to avail itself of a greater surface area for diffusion.
In case you are wondering why the $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ analysis has two terms less than the CO analysis, one term is missing because $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ does not interact with Hb (point 2 for CO ), and a second term is missing because we cannot further decrease the mixedvenous $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ content below zero (point 3 for CO ).

$\left(\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\text {gas }}}\right.$ ). Furthermore, if the partial-pressure profile of the gas along the capillary were linear, we could use an average capillary partial pressure $\left(\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{C}_{\text {gas }}}\right)$ as well. If we could identify a gas for which these assumptions are reasonable, we could simplify Equation 30-23 to an expression that is similar to the version of Fick's law with which we started this chapter (see Equation 30-7):

$$
\text { Overall } \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{gas}}=\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{gas}} \cdot\left(\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{gas}}}-\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{gas}}}\right)
$$

Which gas could we use to estimate $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ? We certainly do not want to use $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$, whose uptake is perfusion limited. After all, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ is more or less proportional to changes in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$, but virtually insensitive to changes in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (see Table 30-2). Viewed differently, the driving pressure between alveolus and capillary $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CN}_{2} \mathrm{O}}\right)$ is high at the beginning of the capillary but soon falls to zero (see Fig. 30-6B). Thus, it would be very difficult to pick a reasonable value for the average capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ to insert into Equation 30-24. However, CO is an excellent choice because its uptake is diffusion limited, so that changes in the parameter of interest (i.e., $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ) have nearly a proportionate effect on $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. Viewed differently, the driving pressure between alveolus and capillary $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CN}_{2}}\right)$ is nearly ideal because it falls more or less linearly as blood courses down the pulmonary capillary (see Fig. 30-5B). Thus, we might solve Equation 30-24 for $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ :

$$
\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}}{\left(\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}-\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}\right)}
$$

Note that $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ are average values that reflect properties of all alveoli throughout both lungs at all times in the respiratory cycle. $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ reflects minor changes during the respiratory cycle, as well as more substantial variations in $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ from alveolus to alveolus due to local differences in ventilation and perfusion (see pp. 689-690). Finally, $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ reflects not only the small increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ as blood flows down the capillary, but also any CO that may be present in the mixed-venous blood that enters the pulmonary capillary. For nonsmokers who live in a nonpolluted environment, $\mathrm{PV}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is nearly zero, and thus we often can ignore $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$.

We will discuss two general methods for estimating $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, the steady-state technique and the single-breath test. These tests, both using CO, are useful for estimation of pulmonary diffusing capacity in a clinical setting, even among very ill patients in the intensive care unit.

In the steady-state technique (Fig. 30-8), the subject breathes a low-CO air mixture (e.g., $0.1 \%$ to $0.2 \%$ ) for approximately a dozen breaths to allow $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ to stabilize. Calculating $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ requires at least two measurements: $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$. We compute the rate of CO uptake from the difference between the amounts of CO in inspired air versus expired air over time. We can directly measure $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$ in an alveolar-air sample (see pp. 676-677). $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is then $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}} / \overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$. If the subject happens to be a smoker or to live in a polluted environment, an accurate measurement of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ requires a venous blood sample to estimate the $\mathrm{PV}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. In this case, we calculate $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ from the more complete expression in Equation 30-25.

In the single-breath technique (Fig. 30-9), the subject makes a maximal expiratory effort to residual volume (see
![bo104465312c5](bo104465312c5.jpg)

Figure 30-8 Steady-state method for estimating $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.
p. 602) and then makes a maximal inspiration of air containing CO and holds the breath for 10 seconds. The inhaled air is a mixture of dilute CO (e.g., $0.3 \%$ ) plus a gas such as helium, which has a low water solubility and thus a negligible transport across the blood-gas barrier (see Equation 30-5). We can use helium to compute the extent to which the inhaled $\mathrm{CO} / \mathrm{He}$ mixture becomes diluted as it first enters the alveoli, and also to calculate the alveolar volume into which the $\mathrm{CO} / \mathrm{He}$ mixture distributes (see p. 602). This information allows us to calculate two crucial parameters at the beginning of the breath-holding period: (1) $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and (2) the amount of CO in the alveoli. During the 10 seconds of breath holding, some of the inhaled CO diffuses into the blood. The greater the $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, the greater the diffusion of CO , and the more $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ falls. As the subject exhales, we obtain a sample of alveolar air and use it to determine two crucial parameters at the end of the breath-holding period: (1) $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ and (2) the amount of CO in the alveoli. The initial and final $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ values allow us to compute $\overline{\mathrm{P}}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}}}$. The initial and final alveolar CO amounts allow us to compute $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ during the 10 -second breath-holding period.

Bear in mind that the value of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ determined by use of either of these methods is an average pulmonary diffusing capacity. As discussed in Chapter 31, pulmonary disease can cause ventilation to become nonuniform, making it difficult to obtain alveolar-air samples that are representative of the entire lung. N30-7 A normal value for $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ is $\sim 25 \mathrm{~mL}$ CO taken up per minute for each millimeter of mercury of partial pressure driving CO diffusion and for each milliliter of blood having a normal Hb content. This value of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$

# N30-7 Effect of Nonuniformity of Ventilation on Alveolar-Air Samples 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In Chapter 31, we will introduce the single-breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout technique and Fowler method for measuring anatomical dead space (see pp. 676-677). In this approach, the subject inhales one breath of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and we assume that the inspired $100 \%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ distributes evenly throughout all the alveoli of the lungs. If ventilation is indeed uniform, the inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dilutes alveolar $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ uniformly in all regions of the lung. Thus, when the subject exhales, the air emerging from the alveolar air spaces should have a uniform $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$, and the plateau of the single-breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ washout should be flat, as shown by the part of the red curve in Figure 31-2C labeled "Pure alveolar air."

However, if the alveoli are unevenly ventilated, the inhaled $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ will not distribute uniformly throughout the lungs and therefore will not uniformly dilute the pre-existing alveolar $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Regions of the lung that are relatively hypoventilated will receive
relatively less $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ during the single inspiration, so that they will be relatively poor in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ but rich in $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Conversely, hyperventilated regions will receive relatively more of the inhaled $100 \%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and hence will be $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ rich and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ poor. During the expiration, we no longer observe a plateau for $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$. Why? After exhalation of the anatomical dead space, the first alveolar air out of the lungs is dominated by the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-rich $/ \mathrm{N}_{2}$-poor gas coming from the relatively hyperventilated airways-which inflate and deflate relatively quickly. As the expiration continues, the alveolar air gradually becomes dominated more and more by the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-poor $/ \mathrm{N}_{2}$ rich gas from the hypoventilated airways, which inflate and deflate relatively slowly. Because of this shift from hyperventilated to hypoventilated regions, the $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ gradually creeps upward-that is, there is no clear plateau-in subjects with a sufficiently high nonuniformity of ventilation.

| Exercise | Exercise $\rightarrow \uparrow \mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ | An $\uparrow$ in $\dot{\mathrm{O}}$ causes dilation of pulmonary capillaries, which in turn causes an $\uparrow$ in area for diffusion (A) and volume of pulmonary-capillary blood $\left(V_{c}\right)$. |

$\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$, diffusion capacity of $\mathrm{CO} ; \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in alveolar air; $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ partial pressure of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in alveolar air; $\dot{\mathrm{O}}$, cardiac output.
depends not only on $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ (i.e., the "membrane" or truly diffusive component of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ ) in Equation 30-15 but also on $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$. For CO transport, $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ and $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ are each $\sim 50 \mathrm{~mL}$ $\mathrm{CO} /(\min \cdot \mathrm{mL}$ blood $):$

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}}=\frac{1}{50}+\frac{1}{50}=\frac{1}{25}
$$

Thus, $1 /\left(\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ makes a major contribution to the final $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$. Because $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$ is proportional to the Hb content of the blood, and because Hb content is decreased in anemia, a subject can have a reduced $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$ even though the diffusion pathways in the lung (i.e., $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ ) are perfectly normal. Recall
that $1 /\left(\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ makes an insignificant contribution to the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Nevertheless, it is the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for CO - and not that for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-that one uses for a clinical index of diffusing capacity. Table 30-3 summarizes several factors that can affect the calculated $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.

## For both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, transport is normally perfusion limited

Uptake of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Blood enters the pulmonary capillaries (Fig. 30-10A) with the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood, typically 40 mm Hg . Capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ reaches the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ about one third of the way along the capillary

# N30-10 Effect of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ on the Diffusing Capacity 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

An increase in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes an increase in pulmonarycapillary blood $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ and thus an increase in the $\left(\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}\right)$ term of $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ :

$$
\frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}} \cong \frac{1}{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}}+\frac{1}{\theta \cdot \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{c}}}
$$

The preceding equation is a repetition of Equation 30-15. We will see in Chapter 31 that a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes pulmonary vasoconstriction (see p. 687). Evidently, the predominant effect of increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (e.g., caused by breathing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ ) is to constrict pulmonary venules more than arterioles, thereby distending the pulmonary capillaries and thus increasing $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$. Note that according to this scenario, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ has no effect on $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{M}}$ (i.e., it has no direct effect on diffusion per se).

In $\mathbf{B}$ through $\mathbf{D}, \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. In $\mathbf{B}$ and $\mathbf{D}_{L} \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is constant.
(see Fig. 30-10B, black curve). This $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ profile along the pulmonary capillary is intermediate between that of CO in Figure 30-5B (where CO fails to reach diffusion equilibrium) and $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ in Figure 30-6B (where $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ reaches diffusion equilibrium $\sim 10 \%$ of the way along the capillary). The transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is similar to that of CO in that both molecules bind to Hb . Why, then, does $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reach diffusion equilibrium, whereas CO does not?

The uptake of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ differs from that of CO in three important respects. First, Hb that enters the pulmonary capillary is already heavily preloaded with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Because Hb in the mixed-venous blood is $\sim 75 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see p. 650) -versus $\sim 0 \%$ for CO-the available $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-binding capacity of Hb is relatively low. Second, because the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is rather high (i.e., $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ )-versus $<1 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ for CO-the alveolar-blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient is large (i.e., $\sim 60 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) and the initial rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffusion from the alveolus into pulmonary-capillary blood is immense. Third, $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is higher than that for CO , owing to a greater $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{c}}$. As a result of these three factors, Hb in pulmonary-capillary blood rapidly approaches its equilibrium carrying capacity for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ along the first third of the capillary. Because capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ reaches alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{D}_{2}}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport is perfusion limited, as is the case for $\mathrm{N}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Because $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ normally reaches diffusion equilibrium so soon along the capillary, the lung has a tremendous $\mathbf{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ reserve for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake. (T) N30-8 Even if we reduce $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by half, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ still reaches diffusion equilibrium about two thirds of the way along the capillary (see Fig. 30-10B, blue curve). If we could double $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$ would reach diffusion equilibrium much earlier than usual (see Fig. 30-10B, red curve). However, neither change in $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would affect $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake, which is not diffusion limited.

The $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ reserve for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake is extremely important during exercise, when cardiac output can increase by up to a factor of 5 (see p. 410), a change that substantially decreases the contact time of the blood with the pulmonary capillaries. The contact time appears not to decrease by more than a factor of $\sim 3$, probably because the slightly increased pressure recruits and distends the pulmonary vessels (see p. 687). As a result, even with vigorous exercise, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ reaches virtual equilibrium with the alveolar air by the end of the capillary (see Fig. 30-10C, green curve)-except in some elite athletes. (T) N30-9 Thus, the increase in $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ during exercise leads to a corresponding increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, which carries obvious survival benefits. In patients with pulmonary disease, thickening of the alveolar blood-gas barrier can reduce $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ sufficiently that equilibration of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ fails to occur by capillary's end during exercise (see Fig. 30-10C, brown curve). In this case, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport becomes diffusion limited.

Like exercise, high altitude stretches out the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ profile along the capillary (see Fig. 30-10D, red curve). The reasons are two, both of which stem from the low barometric pressure at altitude, which leads to a proportional decrease in ambient $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see p. 1230) and thus to a fall in alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. First, the low $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ causes the alveolar-capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient at the beginning of the capillary to fall, reducing the absolute $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport rate. It is true that continued $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction by the systemic tissues causes $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to fall as well in the mixedvenous blood that enters the pulmonary capillaries. However, at altitude, the difference driving $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ uptake, $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{PV}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, is

The $D_{L}$ reserve for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ along the pulmonary capillaries is reminiscent of the filtration reserve that exists along the capillaries of the glomerulus in the kidney (see pp. 745-746). In both cases, the system is able to accommodate a substantial increase in blood flow before saturating.

## N30-9 Exercise-Induced Arterial Hypoxemia in Females

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

In elite male athletes-and thoroughbred race horses, which are bred to have an impressive cardiac output-maximal aerobic exercise may lead to arterial hypoxemia-a fall in the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of arterial blood. The reason for this hypoxemia is believed to be a cardiac output that outstrips the lung's diffusion reserve, leading to a failure to reach diffusion equilibrium in the pulmonary capillaries (i.e., diffusion-limited $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport). Note that in most men-those with normal levels of maximal cardiac output-maximum exercise does not lead to arterial hypoxemia. Instead, the exercise-induced increase in ventilation maintains a near-normal arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and usually a lower-than-normal arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

In women, however, it is common for exercise to lead to arterial hypoxemia. This effect does not correlate with level of physical fitness but appears to be constitutional, possibly reflecting an exercise-induced increase in ventilation-perfusion mismatch.

still smaller than normal. Second, because at altitude $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is lower, we now operate on a steeper part of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-3). Thus, a given increment in the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the pulmonary-capillary blood occurs with a smaller increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.

The combination of exercise and high altitude can cause $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to become diffusion limited even in healthy individuals (see Fig. 30-10D, green curve). If the subject also has a pathological condition that lowers $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, then transport may become diffusion limited even more readily at altitude. Obviously, any combination of exercise, high altitude, and reduced $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ compounds the problems for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport.

Escape of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Mixed-venous blood entering the pulmonary capillary has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, whereas the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (Fig. 30-11A). Thus, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses in the opposite direction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-from blood to alveolus-and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls along the pulmonary capillary (see Fig. 30-11B, black curve), eventually reaching diffusion equilibrium. Compared with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, one factor that tends to speed $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibration is that the $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is 3 -fold to 5 -fold greater than that for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see p. 664). However, two factors tend to slow the equilibration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. First, the initial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ gradient across the blood-gas barrier is only $\sim 6 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ at the beginning of the capillary, $\sim 10 \%$ as large as the initial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient. Second, in their physiological ranges, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-10) is far steeper than the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-3). Thus, a decrement in the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the pulmonary-capillary blood causes a relatively small decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Thus, a smaller gradient and a steeper dissociation curve counteract the larger $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$. Many authors believe that, as indicated by the black curve in Figure 30-11B, capillary $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ reaches alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ about one third of the way along the pulmonary capillary (as is the case for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ ). Others have suggested that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ equilibration is slower, occurring just before the end of the pulmonary capillary. In either case, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ excretion is perfusion limited. The decrease in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ that occurs in
certain lung diseases (see next section) or heavy exercise (see Fig. 30-11B, red and blue curves) may cause the transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to become diffusion limited.

## Pathological changes that reduce $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ do not necessarily produce hypoxia

The measured pulmonary diffusing capacity for CO falls in disease states accompanied by a thickening of the alveolar blood-gas barrier, a reduction in the surface area (i.e., capillaries) available for diffusion, or a decrease in the amount of Hb in the pulmonary capillaries. Examples of pathological processes accompanied by a decrease in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ include the following:

Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, a fibrotic process causing a thickening of the interstitium, thickening of alveolar walls, and destruction of capillaries-sometimes with marked decreases in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$. In some cases, the cause is unknown (i.e., idiopathic); in others it is secondary to such disorders as sarcoidosis, scleroderma, and exposure to occupational agents (e.g., asbestos).
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which not only increases the resistance of conducting airways (see p. 597) but can lead to a destruction of pulmonary capillaries and thus a reduction in both (1) surface area available for diffusion, and (2) total pulmonary-capillary Hb content (see p. 619).
Loss of functional lung tissue, as caused by surgical removal of lung tissue. $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ falls because of a decrease in both (1) surface area, and (2) total pulmonary-capillary Hb content.
Anemia, in which the fall in total Hb content decreases the $\theta \cdot \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{s}}$ component of $\mathrm{DL}_{\mathrm{CO}}$.

Although pulmonary diseases can cause both a decrease in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and hypoxemia (i.e., a decrease in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ), it is not necessarily true that the decrease in $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ is the sole or even

the major cause of the hypoxemia. The same diseases that lower $D_{L}$ also upset the distribution of ventilation and perfusion throughout the lung. As discussed in Chapter 31, mismatching of ventilation to perfusion among various regions of the lungs can be a powerful influence leading to hypoxemia. Furthermore, because the lung has a sizeable $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ reserve for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (and perhaps for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as well), $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ would have to decrease to about one third of its normal value for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport to become diffusion limited. Thus, in a disease causing
both a decrease in $D_{L}$ and disturbances in the distribution of ventilation and perfusion, it is difficult to determine the extent to which an accompanying reduction of $D_{L}$ is responsible for the resulting hypoxemia.

# VENTILATION AND PERFUSION OF THE LUNGS 

Walter F. Boron

Although diffusion is at the very heart of the gas exchange, as we discussed in Chapter 30, two other parameters are also extremely important. Ventilation and perfusion-both of which require energy-are critical because they set up the partial-pressure gradients along which $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuse. Ventilation is the convective movement of air that exchanges gases between the atmosphere and the alveoli. In Chapter 27 we discussed the mechanics of ventilation. In the first part of the present chapter we consider the importance of ventilation for determining alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and also see that ventilation varies from one group of alveoli to the next. Perfusion is the convective movement of blood that carries the dissolved gases to and from the lung. In Chapters 17 through 25 we discussed the cardiovascular system. In the second part of the present chapter, we examine the special properties of the pulmonary circulation and see that, like ventilation, perfusion varies in different regions of the lung. Finally, in the third part of this chapter, we see that the ratio of ventilation to perfusionand the distribution of ventilation-perfusion ratios among alveolar units-is critically important for gas exchange and thus for the composition of the arterial blood gases: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH .

## VENTILATION

About 30\% of total ventilation in a respiratory cycle is wasted ventilating anatomical dead space (i.e., conducting airways)

Total ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}\right)$ is the volume of air moved out of the lungs per unit of time:

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{\mathrm{V}}{\mathrm{t}}
$$

Here V is the volume of air exiting the lungs during a series of breaths. Note that we are using $\dot{V}$ differently than in Chapter 27, where $\dot{V}$ represented flow through an airway at a particular instant in time. A practical definition is that $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}}$ is the product of tidal volume (TV or $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ ) and the respiratory frequency (f). Thus, for someone with a tidal volume of 0.5 L , breathing 12 breaths/min,

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{T}} & =\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}} \cdot \mathrm{f} \\
& =(0.5 \mathrm{~L}) \cdot(12 / \mathrm{min}) \\
& =6 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}
\end{aligned}
$$

Because total ventilation usually is reported in $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$, it is sometimes called minute ventilation.

Before an inspiration, the conducting airways are filled with "stale" air having the same composition as alveolar air (Fig. 31-1, step 1); we will see why shortly. During inspiration, $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of "fresh" atmospheric air (high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} / \mathrm{low} \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ) enters the body (step 2). However, only the first 350 mL reaches the alveoli; the final 150 mL remains in the conducting airways (i.e., nose, pharynx, larynx, trachea, and other airways without alveoli)-that is, the anatomical dead space. These figures are typical for a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ person; $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}$ and $\mathrm{V}_{0}$ are roughly proportional to body size. During inspiration, $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of air also enters the alveoli. However, the first 150 mL is stale air previously in the conducting airways; only the final 350 mL is fresh air. By the end of inspiration, the 500 mL of air that entered the alveoli ( 150 mL of stale air plus 350 mL of fresh air) has mixed by diffusion with the pre-existing alveolar air (see Fig. 31-1, step 3). During expiration (step 4), the first 150 mL of air emerging from the body is the fresh air left in the conducting airways from the previous inspiration. As the expiration continues, 350 mL of stale alveolar air sequentially moves into the conducting airways and then exits the body-for a total of 500 mL of air leaving the body. Simultaneously, 500 mL of air leaves the alveoli. The first 350 mL is the same 350 mL that exited the body. The final 150 mL of stale air to exit the alveoli remains in the conducting airways, as we are ready to begin the next inspiration.

Thus, with each $500-\mathrm{mL}$ inspiration, only the initial 350 mL of fresh air entering the body reaches the alveoli. With each $500-\mathrm{mL}$ expiration, only the final 350 mL of air exiting the body comes from the alveoli. One $150-\mathrm{mL}$ bolus of fresh air shuttles back and forth between the atmosphere and conducting airways. Another $150-\mathrm{mL}$ bolus of stale air shuttles back and forth between the conducting airways and alveoli. Dead-space ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$ is the volume of the stale air so shuttled per minute. Alveolar ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathbf{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ is the volume of fresh air per minute that actually reaches the

alveoli, or the volume of stale alveolar air that reaches the atmosphere. (1) N31-1 Thus, total ventilation-a reflection of the work invested in breathing-is the sum of the wasted dead-space ventilation and the useful alveolar ventilation. In our example,

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { liters breaths liters } \\
& \text { breath minute minute } \\
& \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} \cdot \mathrm{f}=0.150 \cdot 12=1.8 \\
& \frac{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{A}}=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right) \cdot \mathrm{f}=0.350 \cdot 12=4.2}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{T}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{T}} \cdot \mathrm{f}=0.500 \cdot 12=6.0}
\end{aligned}
$$

so that the dead-space ventilation is $30 \%$ of the total ventilation.

The inset of Figure 31-1 illustrates how inspiration and expiration lead to small fluctuations in the alveolar partial pressures for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, noted above in Figure 30-3B. Throughout the respiratory cycle, blood flowing through the pulmonary capillaries continuously draws $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ out of the alveolar air and adds $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Just before an inspiration, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ has fallen to its lowest point, and alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ has risen to its highest. During inspiration, a new bolus of inspired fresh air mixes with pre-existing alveolar air, which causes alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to rise and alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall. During expiration and until the next inspiration, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ gradually drift to the values that we saw at the start of the respiratory cycle. Assuming that functional residual capacity (FRC) is 3 L and that each breath adds 350 mL of fresh air, one can calculate that alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ oscillates with an amplitude of $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, whereas alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ oscillates with an amplitude of $\sim 4 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

## The Fowler single-breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout technique estimates anatomical dead space

In 1948, Ward Fowler introduced an approach for estimating the anatomical dead space, based on the washout of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ from the lungs. The key concept is that $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ is physiologically inert. After the subject has been breathing room air, the alveolar air is $\sim 75 \% \mathrm{~N}_{2}$. After a quiet expiration, when lung volume is FRC (Fig. 31-2A, step 1), the subject takes a single normal-sized breath ( $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ ). The inspired air is $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, although, in principle we could use any nontoxic gas mixture lacking $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. The first portion of inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ enters the alveolar spaces (step 2), where it rapidly mixes by diffusion and dilutes the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and other gases remaining after the previous breaths of room air (step 3). The last portion of the inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}(\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL})$ remains in the conducting airways, which have a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ of zero.

The subject now exhales $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ of air (see Fig. 31-2A, step 4). If no mixing occurred between the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-free air in the most distal conducting airways and the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-containing air in the most proximal alveolar spaces, then the first $\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL}$ of air emerging from the body would have an $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ of zero (see Fig. 31-2B, red lines). After this would come a sharp transition to a much higher $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ for the final $\sim 350 \mathrm{~mL}$ of expired air. Thus, the expired volume with an $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ of zero would represent air from the conducting airways (anatomical dead space), whereas the remainder would represent air from the alveoli.

In reality, some mixing occurs between the air in the conducting airways and alveoli, so that the transition is S-shaped (see Fig. 31-2C, red curve). A vertical line drawn through the S-shaped curve (1) N31-3 so that area $a$ is the same as area $b$ marks the idealized transition between air

## N31-1 Inhaled Versus Exhaled Volume

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption (e.g., $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) is generally greater than the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production (e.g., $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) in individuals consuming a typical Western-pattern diet. That is, the respiratory quotient (RQ) is generally less than unity (see p. 681). As a result, every minute we inhale slightly more air than we exhale (e.g., $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}-200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}=50 \mathrm{~mL} /$ min ). Because of this difference, in reporting ventilatory volumes, respiratory physiologists have standardized on the volume of exhaled air $\left(\mathrm{V}_{2}\right)$, which as we have noted is slightly smaller than the volume of inhaled air (V.).

## N31-3 Shape of the Single-Breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-Washout Curve

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Exhaling vigorously causes turbulence (see p. 617) in the larger airways, further blurring the boundary between dead space and alveolar air. The greater the mixing, the more spread out is the S-shaped transition in Figure 31-2C.

Breath holding not only blurs the boundary (because more time is available for diffusional mixing of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the alveolar spaces with the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the dead space) but also moves the boundary to the left. In fact, if you were to hold your breath infinitely long, all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in your conducting airways would be contaminated with $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. As a result, the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ profile in Figure 31-2B or $C$ would be a low, stable value from the very first milliliter of exhaled air. That is, there would be no gray area, and it would appear-according to the Fowler technique-as if you did not have any dead space.

Inhaling a large tidal volume of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ increases the apparent anatomical dead space as measured by the Fowler technique. The reason is that the conducting airways have a finite compliance (see p. 610)—lower than the compliance of alveoli, but still greater than zero. Thus, with a large inhalation (and thus a rather negative intrapleural pressure), the conducting airways dilate somewhat, and this dilation is reflected in a larger-than-normal value for anatomical dead space.

## N31-2 Oscillations in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ During Breathing

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

We will assume that the volume of alveolar air after a quiet expiration is 3000 mL (the FRC), and that this air has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 98.4 mm Hg-the nadir of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ during our hypothetical respiratory cycle. The subsequent inspiration delivers to the alveoli 350 mL of fresh air (at 500 mL tidal volume less 150 mL of anatomical dead space) that has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 149 mm Hg . Thus, after the 350 mL of fresh air mixes with the 3000 mL of preexisting alveolar air, the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ will be

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{(3000 \times 98.4)+(350 \times 149)}{(3000+350)}=103.6 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \quad(\text { NE 31-1) }
$$

This value is the zenith of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ during our hypothetical respiratory cycle. During the ensuing several seconds, the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ drifts back down to 98.4 mm Hg as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ diffuses from the alveolar air into the pulmonary-capillary blood. Thus, during a respiratory cycle, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ oscillates from a low of 98.4 mm Hg to a high of 103.6 mm Hg , with a mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 101 mm Hg . In other words, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ oscillates around a mean of 101 mm Hg , with the peak and nadir deviating from the mean by $\sim 2.6 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$-an amplitude of $\sim 5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

In the case of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the analysis is similar. After a quiet expiration, the 3000 mL of alveolar air has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 42.2 mm Hg -the zenith of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ during our hypothetical respiratory cycle. The subsequent inspiration delivers to the alveoli 350 mL of fresh air, which has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, after the 350 mL of fresh air mixes with the 3000 mL of preexisting alveolar air, the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ will be

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{(3000 \times 42.2)+(350 \times 0)}{(3000+350)}=37.8 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg} \quad(\text { NE 31-2) }
$$

This value is the nadir of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ during our hypothetical respiratory cycle. During the ensuing several seconds, the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ drifts back up to 42.2 mm Hg as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses from the pulmonary-capillary blood to the alveolar air. Thus, during a respiratory cycle, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ oscillates from a high of 42.2 mm Hg to a low of 37.8 mm Hg , with a mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg . In other words, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ oscillates around a mean of 40 mm Hg , with the peak and nadir deviating from the mean by $\sim 2.2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$-an amplitude of $\sim 4 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

from conducing and alveolar airways-as in Figure 31-2B. The expired lung volume at the point of this vertical line is thus the anatomical dead space. In Figure 31-2C, the part of the S-shaped curve with an expired $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ of zero represents pure dead-space air, the part where $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ gradually rises represents a mixture of dead-space and alveolar air, and the part where $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ is high and flat represents pure alveolar air. This plateau is important, because it is during this plateau that one obtains an alveolar gas sample. (5) N31-4

## The Bohr expired- $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ approach estimates physiological dead space

In principle, we could compute the dead space using any gas whose expiration profile looks like that of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Nitrogen is useful because we can easily create an artificial situation in which the subject makes a single inhalation of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-free air (e.g., a single breath of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ ). Another possibility is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Its profile during expiration is similar to that of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Moreover, we do not need to use any special tricks to get it to work because room air has practically no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Yet plenty of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is in the alveoli, where it evolves from the incoming mixedvenous blood. After a quiet expiration (Fig. 31-3A, step 1), the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the alveolar air is virtually the same as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the arterial blood (see p. 673), $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The subject now inhales a normal tidal volume ( $\sim 500 \mathrm{~mL}$ ) of room air, although any $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-free gas mixture would do. The first portion enters the alveoli (step 2), where it rapidly dilutes the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other gases remaining after the previous breath (step 3). The rest $(\sim 150 \mathrm{~mL})$ remains in the conducting
airways, which now have a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 0$. When the subject now expires (step 4), the first air that exits the body is the $\mathrm{CO}_{2^{-}}$ free gas that had filled the conducting airways, followed by the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-containing alveolar air. Thus, the idealized profile of expired $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ (see Fig. 31-3B, red lines) is similar to the idealized $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ profile (see Fig. 31-2B). In particular, the volume of expired air at the vertical line in Figure 31-3B is the estimated anatomical dead space.

One could use a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ probe to record the expired $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ profile during a single-breath $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ washout, rather than the $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ profile that Fowler used to measure anatomical dead space. However, because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ probes did not exist in his day, Christian Bohr (5) N31-5 used a single-breath $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ washout but analyzed the average $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the mixed-expired air (i.e., averaged over the dead space plus expired alveolar air).

The principle of the Bohr approach is that the amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ present in the volume of mixed-expired air $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}\right)$ is the sum of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contributed by the volume of air from the dead space $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$ plus the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contributed by the volume of air coming from the alveoli $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$. As summarized in Figure 31-3B:

1. The amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ coming from the dead space is the product of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in this dead-space air. Because $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{D}}$ is zero, the area beneath $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ is also zero.
2. The amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ coming from alveolar air is the product of $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right)$ and alveolar $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ and is represented by the rose area in Figure 31-3B.
3. The total amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the mixed-expired air is the product of $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ and the average $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ in this air and is represented by the hatched area in Figure 31-3B.

## N31-4 Obtaining a Sample of Alveolar Air

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

How do we obtain the alveolar air sample? As noted in our discussion of the Fowler single-breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-washout technique on pages 676-677, we ask the subject to make a prolonged expiratory effort. We discard the first several hundred milliliters of expired air-which contains pure dead-space air, a mixture of dead-space and alveolar air, and some pure alveolar air-to be certain that we do not contaminate our sample with air from the conducting airways. We then collect the end-tidal sample of air-pure alveolar air-and assay it for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

Christian Bohr (1855-1911), a native of Copenhagen, was an eminent physiologist and also the father of the physicist Niels Bohr. The major contributions of Christian Bohr were the first description of dead space (specifically the physiological dead space) and the description of the Bohr effect. Christian Bohr was a proponent of the hypothesis that the lung actively secretes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ into the pulmonary-capillary blood. His trainee, future Nobelist August Krogh. (5) N31-21 later disproved this hypothesis.

Figure 31-3 Bohr method for measuring physiological dead space.

Because the rose and hatched areas in Figure 31-3B must be equal, and because the alveolar and expired $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ values are proportional to their respective $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values, it is possible to show that (5) R21-6

$$
\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{E}}}=\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}-\mathrm{PE}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

This is the Bohr equation. Typically, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ ranges between 0.20 and 0.35 . For a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ of 150 mL and a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ of $500 \mathrm{~mL}, \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ would be 0.30 . For example, if the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg and the mixed-expired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 28 mm Hg , then

$$
\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{E}}}=\frac{40-28}{40}=30 \%
$$

Equation 31-4 makes good intuitive sense. In an imaginary case in which we reduced $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ to zero, the expired air would be entirely from the alveoli, so that

$$
\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{E}}}=\frac{40-40}{40}=0 \%
$$

On the other hand, if we reduced the tidal volume to a value at or below the dead-space volume, then all of the expired air would be dead-space air. In this case, $\mathrm{PE}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would be zero, and

$$
\frac{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}}{\mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{E}}}=\frac{40-0}{40}=100 \%
$$

Two examples of this principle are of practical importance. During panting, the respiratory frequency is very high, but the tidal volume is only slightly greater than the anatomical dead space. Thus, most of the total ventilation is wasted as dead-space ventilation. If we reduced tidal volume below $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$, then in principle there would be no alveolar ventilation at all! During snorkeling, a swimmer breathes through a tube that increases $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$. If the snorkeling tube had a volume of 350 mL and the dead space within the body of the swimmer were 150 mL , then a tidal volume of 500 mL would in principle produce no alveolar ventilation. Consequently, the swimmer would suffocate, even though total ventilation was normal! Thus, the fractional dead space $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}\right)$ depends critically on tidal volume.

It is important to recognize that although the Fowler and Bohr methods yield about the same estimate for $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ in

# N31-6 The Bohr Equation 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The principle of the Bohr approach is that the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration of the expired air is the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration of the alveolar air-as diluted by the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the dead space, which contains no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Imagine that we have a volume of expired air $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}\right)$. The total amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ present in this expired air is the sum of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contributed by the volume of air from the dead space $\left(V_{D}\right)$ and the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contributed by the volume of air coming from the alveoli $\left(V_{E}-V_{D}\right):$

$$
\left[\text { Amount of } \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right] \text { in expired air }=\left[\begin{array}{l}
\text { Amount of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \\
\text { contributed by } \\
\text { conducting airways }
\end{array}\right]+\left[\begin{array}{l}
\text { Amount of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \\
\text { contributed by } \\
\text { alveolar air }
\end{array}\right]
$$

(NE 31-3)
Knowing that the amount of the gas is simply the product of the volume and the concentration of the gas in that volume, we can write

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}} \times\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{E}}=\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} \times\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{D}}+\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right) \times\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{A}}
$$

Note that the volume of air coming from the alveoli is not the total volume of alveolar air, which might be a couple of liters, but rather that part of the expired volume that came from the alveoli. For example, if the expired volume were 500 mL and the dead space were 150 mL , the air coming from the alveoli $\left(V_{E}-V_{D}\right)$ would be 350 mL .

Because $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{D}}$ is virtually zero, we can drop the "conducting airway" term from Equation NE 31-4. In other words, the hatched area beneath the dashed line in Figure 31-3B is equal to the red area under the solid red line. The simplified version of Equation NE 31-4 is thus

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}} \times\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{E}}=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right) \times\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]_{\mathrm{A}}
$$

Furthermore, because the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration is proportional to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressure, and because the proportionality constant is the same for the expired air and the alveolar air,

$$
\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}} \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}-\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}\right) \times \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}
$$

We can rearrange this equation and solve for the ratio $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$, which is the fraction of the expired volume that came from the dead space:

$$
\frac{V_{D}}{V_{E}}=\frac{P_{V_{C O_{2}}}-P_{V_{C O_{2}}}}{P_{V_{C O_{2}}}}
$$

(NE 31-7)
This is the Bohr equation. Typically, $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ ranges between 0.20 and 0.35 . For a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ of 150 mL and a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ of $500 \mathrm{~mL}, \mathrm{~V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ would be 0.30 . Because the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the deadspace air is virtually zero, $\mathrm{PE}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ must be less than $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. For example, imagine that the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ were 40 mm Hg and the average $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the expired air were 28 mm Hg :

$$
\frac{V_{D}}{V_{E}}=\frac{40-28}{40}=30 \%
$$

Equation NE 31-7 makes good intuitive sense. In an extreme hypothetical case in which we reduced $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ to zero, the expired air would be entirely from the alveoli, so that

$$
\frac{V_{D}}{V_{E}}=\frac{40-40}{40}=0 \%
$$

On the other hand, if the tidal volume and the dead space were both 150 mL , then all of the expired air would be deadspace air. Thus, the $\mathrm{PE}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would have to be zero, and

$$
\frac{V_{D}}{V_{E}}=\frac{40-0}{40}=100 \%
$$

If the tidal volume were increased from 500 mL to 600 mL and $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ remained at 150 mL , the ratio $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}} / \mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$ would fall from 0.30 to 0.25 . With a greater $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{E}}$, the alveolar air would make a greater contribution to the mixed expired air, so that the mean expired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would be 30 mm Hg (i.e., closer to $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ) instead of only 28 mm Hg . Thus, if you wish to compute $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$ using the Bohr approach, it is best to use an expired volume that is larger than $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{D}}$, but not too much larger.

healthy individuals, the two techniques actually measure somewhat different things. The Fowler approach measures anatomical dead space-the volume of the conducting airways from the mouth/nose up to the point where $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the alveolar gas rapidly dilutes inspired $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$. The Bohr approach, on the other hand, measures the physiological dead space-the volume of airways not receiving $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ from the pulmonary circulation, and, therefore, not engaging in gas exchange. In a healthy person, the anatomical and physiological dead spaces are identical-the volume of the conducting airways. However, if some alveoli are ventilated but not perfused by pulmonary-capillary blood, these unperfused alveoli, like conducting airways, do not contain $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The air in such unperfused alveoli, known as alveolar dead space, contributes to the physiological dead space:

$$
\frac{\text { Physiological }}{\text { dead space }}=\frac{\text { Anatomical }}{\text { dead space }}+\frac{\text { Alveolar }}{\text { Fowler method }}
$$

The Fowler and Bohr methods could yield very different results in a patient with a pulmonary embolism, a condition in which a mass such as a blood clot wedges into and obstructs part or all of the pulmonary circulation. Alveoli downstream from the embolus are ventilated but not perfused; that is, they are alveolar dead space (see Fig. 31-3C). Thus, the Bohr method-but not the Fowler method-could detect an increase in the physiological dead space caused by a pulmonary embolism.

## Alveolar ventilation is the ratio of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production rate to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ mole fraction in alveolar air

One way of computing alveolar ventilation is to subtract the dead space from the tidal volume and multiply the difference by the respiratory frequency (see Equation 31-3). We can also calculate $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ from alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The body produces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ via oxidative metabolism at a rate of $\sim 200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. In the steady state, this rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ must equal the rate at which the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters the alveoli, and the rate at which we exhale the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Of course, this $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of exhaled $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is part of the -4200 mL of total alveolar air that we exhale each minute. Therefore, the exhaled 200 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is $\sim 5 \%$ of the exhaled 4200 mL of alveolar air:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text { Volume of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \\
& \text { leaving alveoli } \\
& \frac{\text { in } 1 \mathrm{~min}}{\text { Volume of air }}=\binom{\text { Volume }}{\text { fraction }}=\binom{\text { Volume }}{\text { of } \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { in }}}{\text { alveolar air }}=\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { mole fraction }\right)_{\mathrm{A}} \\
& \text { in } 1 \mathrm{~min} \\
& \quad \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}}}=\frac{200 \mathrm{~mL}}{4200 \mathrm{~mL}}=5 \%
\end{aligned}
$$

Rearranging the foregoing equation and solving for $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ yields

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { mole fraction }\right)_{\mathrm{A}}}=k \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\mathrm{~Pa}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
$$

The equation above the brace is true only when we measure all parameters under the same conditions. This obvious point would hardly be worth noting if respiratory physiologists had not managed, by historical accident, to measure the two volume terms under different conditions:

1. Body temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor (BTPS; see p. 594) for $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$.
2. Standard temperature and pressure/dry (STPD; see p. 594) for $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

Thus, in Equation 31-10 we introduce a constant $k$ that not only indicates that alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right.$; measured at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) is proportional to the mole fraction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in alveolar air, but also accounts for the different conditions for measuring the parameters.

$(L / \min , B T P S) \quad(\mathrm{mmHg} \cdot \mathrm{L} / \mathrm{mL}) \quad(\mathrm{mm} \mathrm{Hg})$

This is the alveolar ventilation equation, which we can use to compute $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$. We determine $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by collecting a known volume of expired air over a fixed time period and analyzing its $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content. For a $70-\mathrm{kg}$ human, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is $\sim 200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. We can determine $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by sampling the expired air at the end of an expiration-an alveolar gas sample (see pp. 676-677). (5) N31-4 This end-tidal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Fig. 31-2C) is $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In practice, clinicians generally measure arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$, and assume that alveolar and arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ are identical (see p. 673). Inserting these values into the alveolar ventilation equation, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} & =0.863 \cdot \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}=0.863 \cdot \frac{200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}}{40 \mathrm{mmHg}} \\
& =4.315 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the sake of simplicity-and consistency with our example in Equation 31-3-we round this figure to $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$.

Although it is usually safe to regard $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ as being constant for a person at rest, a clinical example in which $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ can increase markedly is malignant hyperthermia (see Box $9-2$ ), which is associated with increased oxidative metabolism. One hallmark of this clinical catastrophe is that the increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ leads to an increase in $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ even though $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ is normal.

## Alveolar and arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ are inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation

Viewing Equation 31-11 from a different perspective illustrates one of the most important concepts in respiratory physiology: Other things being equal, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation. This conclusion makes intuitive sense because the greater the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, the more the fresh, inspired air dilutes the alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Rearranging Equation 31-11 yields

# N31-7 The Conversion Factor 0.863 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

Unfortunately for the student of respiratory physiology, the way customs have evolved for measuring respiratory volumes and partial pressures is a case study in mixed conventions. In a rational world, all parameters would be measured under a consistent set of conditions. In the real world of respiratory science, however, the parameters you (and clinicians) will need to compute alveolar ventilation, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ are measured under at least three very different sets of conditions. As a result, the student is faced with "correction factors" such as 0.863 . Our advice to the student, when working numerical problems, is to insert the laboratory data directly into the correct equation-which you ought to intuitively understand-and use the proper correction factor. You will get the right answer. Before explaining the origin of 0.863 in Equation 31-11, we will examine the system of units in which clinical laboratories report each of the three terms in that equation.

First, $\dot{V}_{A}$, the alveolar ventilation, is reported in the same units as $\dot{V}_{C}$ (the rate at which air is expired from the lungs). If you collect all the warm, moist air that a subject exhales over a period of 1 minute, the laboratory will report that volume BTPS (body temperature and pressure, saturated with water vapor), precisely the same volume that the sample of expired air would have occupied in the warm, moist confines of the lung (see Box 26-3).

Second, $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, the rate at which the body produces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, is measured at STPD (standard temperature and pressure/dry). Thus, if you collect a sample of warm, moist air expired over a period of 1 minute and give it to a clinical laboratory for analysis, the laboratory will report the $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ value as the volume that the dry $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the sample would occupy at $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The rationale is that this is the way chemists treat gases.

Third, $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the alveoli, is reported in BTPD (body temperature and pressure/dry). If you obtain a sample of alveolar air and send it to a clinical laboratory, it will take the warm, moist air you send it and keep it at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but remove the $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. Of course, if the sample is in a rigid container and if P is is 760 mm Hg , this removal of water vapor will lower the total pressure of the sample by 47 mm Hg (i.e., the vapor pressure of water at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ) to 713 mm Hg . To keep the pressure constant, the laboratory will allow the sample volume to decrease to a volume that is $713 / 760$ of the original volume. This, however, means that the mole fraction of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ increases by the fraction $760 / 713$. Thus, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the warm, moist alveolar air is actually lower than the reported BTPD; the BTPS value of $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the reported value multiplied by $(713 / 760)$ or -0.983 . The real tragedy of the convention for reporting $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ at BTPD is that the same laboratory will report arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ as BTPS.

In deriving the factor 0.863 , we begin with a rearrangement of Equation 31-9, using a consistent set of units (i.e., BTPS):

$$
\dot{V}_{A}(\text { BTPS })=\frac{\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPS})}{\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { BTPS }\right)_{A}}
$$

(NE 31-11)
Because $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is actually reported in STPD, our first task is to convert $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (STPD) to $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (BTPS). Because standard temperature is $0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and body temperature is $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we must multiply $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (STPD) by the ratio of temperatures in degrees Kelvin, the factor
$[(273+37) / 273]$. Furthermore, as noted in the previous paragraph, when we add water vapor to a dry sample of a gas and then expand the volume to keep the total pressure fixed at P 0 , the partial pressure of that gas will decrease to $(713 / 760)$ of its dry partial pressure. Thus,

$$
\dot{V}_{A}(\text { BTPS })=\frac{\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{STPD})\left(\frac{310}{273}\right)\left(\frac{713}{760}\right)}{\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \text { BTPS }\right)_{A}} \quad(\text { NE 31-12) }
$$

Our final task is to replace $\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{BTPS}_{A}\right.$ with $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (BTPD). Because $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPS})=\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{BTPS}_{A} \times \mathrm{P}_{B}\right.$,

$$
\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{BTPS}\right)=\frac{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})}{\mathrm{P}_{B}} \quad \text { (NE 31-13) }
$$

Because $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is reported in BTPD, we must multiply it by the factor $(713 / 760)$. Thus,

$$
(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{BTPS})=\frac{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})\left(\frac{713}{760}\right)}{760}
$$

(NE 31-14)
Substituting the expression for $\left(\% \mathrm{CO}_{2} \mathrm{BTPS}\right)_{A}$ in Equation NE 31-14 into Equation NE 31-12, we have

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \dot{V}_{A}(\text { BTPS })=\frac{\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{STPD})\left(\frac{310}{273}\right)\left(\frac{713}{760}\right)}{\left(\frac{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})}{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{B}}}\right)(\text { (NE 31-15) }} \\
& =\frac{\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{STPD})\left(\frac{310}{273}\right)(760)}{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})} \\
& =863 \times \frac{\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{STPD})}{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})}
\end{aligned}
$$

In the above equation, both $\dot{V}_{A}$ and $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ are reported in $\mathrm{mL} /$ min . Because it is customary to report $\dot{V}_{A}$ in $\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min}$, the factor 863 becomes 0.863 :

$$
\begin{gathered}
\mathrm{L} / \mathrm{min} \quad \mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min} \\
\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{A}(\mathrm{BTPS})=0.863 \times \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{STPD})}{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}(\mathrm{BTPD})} \quad \text { (NE 31-16) }
\end{gathered}
$$

The above is the alveolar ventilation equation.
For example, if $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ and $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg , then

$$
\dot{V}_{A}(\text { BTPS })=0.863 \times \frac{200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}}{40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}}=4.315 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}
$$

Figure 31-4 Dependence of alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ on alveolar ventilation. As alveolar ventilation increases, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ approach their values in inspired air. At extremely low or high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, where $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production do not remain constant, these idealized curves are no longer valid.

$$
\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=0.863 \cdot \frac{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}}}
$$

In other words, if $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production is fixed, then doubling $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ causes $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall to half of its initial value. Conversely, halving $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ causes $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to double. Because, arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is virtually the same as alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see p. 673), changes in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ affect both $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

The blue curve in Figure 31-4 helps illustrate the principle. Imagine that your tissues are producing $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. In a steady state, your lungs must blow off 200 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ each minute. Also, imagine that your lungs are exhaling $4200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of alveolar air. Because the 200 mL of expired $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ must dissolve in the 4200 mL of exhaled alveolar air (center red point in Fig. 31-4), Equation 31-13 tells us that your $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (and thus $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ) must be $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

What would happen if the excitement of reading about respiratory physiology caused your alveolar ventilation to double, to $8400 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ? This is an example of hyperventilation. You could double $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ either by doubling respiratory frequency or by doubling the difference between tidal volume and dead space, or a combination of the two (see Equation 31-3). Immediately on doubling $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, you would be blowing off at twice the previous rate not only alveolar air (i.e., $8400 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) but also $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., $400 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ). Because your body would continue to produce only $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-assuming that doubling $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ does not increase $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}-$ you would initially blow off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ faster than you made it, causing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ levels throughout your body to fall. However, the falling $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood would cause alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall as well, and thus the rate at which you blow off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would gradually fall. Eventually, you would reach a new steady state in which the rate at which you blow off $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$
would exactly match the rate at which you produce $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min})$.

When you reach a new steady state, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values in your mixed-venous blood, arterial blood, and alveolar air would be stable. But what would be the $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ? Because each minute you now are blowing off 8400 mL of alveolar air (i.e., twice normal) but still only 200 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (right red point in Fig. 31-4), your $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ must be half normal, or $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Not only does the hyperventilation cause alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall by half, it also causes arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall by half. Thus, hyperventilation leads to respiratory alkalosis (see p. 634). This respiratory alkalosis causes the arterioles in the brain to constrict (see p. 559), reducing blood flow to the brain, which causes dizziness.

What would happen if, instead of doubling alveolar ventilation, you halved it from 4200 to $2100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ? This is an example of hypoventilation. At the instant you began hypoventilating, the volume of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ expired per unit time would fall by half, to $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, even though $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production by the tissues would remain at $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. Thus, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ would build up throughout the body, causing $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to rise. To what value would $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ have to increase before you would reach a new steady state? Because each minute you must exhale 200 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ but this can be diluted in only 2100 mL , or half the usual amount of alveolar air (left red point in Fig. 31-4), the alveolar $\left[\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right]$ must double from -40 to 80 mm Hg . Of course, this doubling of alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is paralleled by a doubling of arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, leading to a respiratory acidosis (see p. 633).

Therefore, the steady-state alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is inversely proportional to alveolar ventilation. The higher the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, the lower the $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. If $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ were infinitely high, then $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ would theoretically fall to zero, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of inspired air.

## Alveolar and arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rise with increased alveolar ventilation

As illustrated by the red curve in Fig. 31-4, increases in alveolar ventilation cause alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to rise and-at an infinite $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$-approach the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$.

Although alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ obviously depends critically on $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, it is also influenced to a lesser extent by alveolar gases other than $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-namely, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}, \mathrm{N}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The partial pressure of $\mathbf{H}_{2} \mathbf{O}$ at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ is 47 mm Hg , and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ will not change unless body temperature changes. The partial pressures of all of the other gases "fit" into what remains of barometric pressure (PB) after $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}}$ has claimed its mandatory 47 mm Hg . We can think of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ as a "spectator molecule," because it is not metabolized; $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ is whatever it has to be to keep the total pressure of the dry alveolar air at $760-47=713 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. That leaves us to deal with $\mathbf{C O}_{2}$.

Because inspired air contains virtually no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, we can think of the alveolar $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ as coming exclusively from metabolism. However, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ depends not only on how fast the tissues burn $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ but also on the kind of fuel they burn. If the fuel is carbohydrate, then the tissues produce one molecule of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for each $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed (see p. 1188). This ratio is termed the respiratory quotient (RQ):

$$
\mathrm{RQ}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}
$$

In this example the RQ is 1 , which is a good place to start when considering how alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ affects alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. If we consider only the dry part of the inspired air that enters the alveoli (see Table 26-1), then $\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ is $713 \times 0.78=557, \mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $713 \times 0.2095=149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and $\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is $\sim 0$. As pulmonarycapillary blood takes up incoming $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, it replaces the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with an equal number of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ molecules in the steady state $(\mathrm{RQ}=1)$. Because the exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is precisely 1 for 1 , alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is what is left of the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ after metabolism replaces some alveolar $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ with $\mathrm{CO}_{2}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\right.$ 40 mm Hg ):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} & =\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\
& =149-40 \\
& =109 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}
\end{aligned}
$$

A typical fat-containing Western-pattern diet produces an RQ of $\sim 0.8$ (see p. 1188), so that 8 molecules of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ replace 10 molecules of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the alveolar air. This 8 -for-10 replacement has two consequences. First, the volume of alveolar air falls slightly during gas exchange. Because the non- $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ pressure remains at 713 mm Hg , this volume contraction concentrates the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and dilutes the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Second, the volume of expired alveolar air is slightly less than the volume of inspired air.

The alveolar gas equation (5) N31-8 describes how alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ depends on RQ:

$$
\mathbf{R Q}=\mathbf{l}: \mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}
$$

General case: $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{Ft}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+\frac{1-\mathrm{Ft}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}\right)$

FI $_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the fraction of inspired $d r y$ air that is $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which is 0.21 for room air (see Table 26-1). Note that when RQ is 1 , the term in parentheses becomes unity, and Equation 31-17 reduces to Equation 31-16. The term in parentheses also becomes unity, regardless of RQ, if $\mathrm{Ft}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is $100 \%$ (i.e., the subject breathes pure $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ )-in this case, no $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ is present to dilute the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$.

A simplified version of Equation 31-17 is nearly as accurate:

$$
\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\frac{\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}
$$

The concepts developed in the last two sections allow us to compute both alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The approach is first to use Equation 31-13 to calculate $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$, and then use Equation 31-17 to calculate $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ from $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and RQ. Imagine that we first found that $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg and that we know that RQ is 0.8 . What is $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ ?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} & =\mathrm{Pt}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \cdot\left(\mathrm{Ft}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+\frac{1-\mathrm{Ft}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}\right) \\
\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} & =149-40 \cdot \underbrace{0.21+\frac{1-0.21}{0.8}}_{1.2} \\
& =149-48 \\
& =101 \mathrm{mmHg}
\end{aligned}
$$

By default, the partial pressure of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ and other gases (e.g., argon) is $\mathrm{Pb}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ or $713-40-101=572 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. For simplicity, we round down this $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to 100 mm Hg in our examples.

## Because of the action of gravity on the lung, regional ventilation in an upright subject is normally greater at the base than the apex

Until now, we have assumed that all alveoli are ventilated to the same extent. We could test this hypothesis by using an imaging technique for assessing the uniformity of ventilation. Imagine that a subject who is standing up breathes air containing ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$. Because Xe has very low water solubility, it (like He and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ ) has a very low diffusing capacity (see pp. 661-663) and-over a short period-remains almost entirely within the alveoli.

Imaging the ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ radioactivity immediately after a single breath of ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ provides an index of absolute regional ventilation (Fig. 31-5A). However, $\left[{ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}\right]$ might be low in a particular region either because the alveoli truly receive little ventilation or because the region has relatively little tissue. Therefore, we normalize the absolute data to the maximal regional alveolar volume. The subject continues to breathe the ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ until $\left[{ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}\right]$ values stabilize throughout the lungs. When the subject now makes a maximal inspiratory effort ( $\mathrm{V}_{1}=$ total lung capacity [TLC]), the level of radioactivity detected over any region reflects that region's maximal volume. Dividing the single-breath image by the steady-state image at TLC yields a ratio that describes regional ventilation per unit volume.

# N31-8 The Alveolar Gas Equation 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The alveolar gas equation allows one to compute the ideal alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ from one's knowledge of the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ as well as two other parameters, the mole fraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the dry inspired air $\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ and the $\mathrm{RQ}$. We begin by deriving an expression for $R Q$, which, as described on page 1188, is defined as the ratio of the rate of metabolic $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ to the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumption $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ :

$$
\mathrm{RQ}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}
$$

For $R Q$ values less than unity, the body consumes more $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ than it produces $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, so that the inspired alveolar ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ must be greater than the expired alveolar ventilation $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}\right)$. Because the metabolically produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ must all appear in the expired alveolar gas, $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the fraction of the expired alveolar ventilation that is $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ gas $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}\right)$ :

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}
$$

(NE 31-19)
Similarly, the consumed $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ must all enter the body via the lungs; $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the difference between (1) the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ entering the alveoli during inspirations over a certain period of time, and (2) the amount of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ exiting the alveoli during expirations over that same time interval:

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\underbrace{\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Rate of } \mathrm{O}_{2} \\
\text { entering the } \\
\text { alveoli }
\end{array}}-\underbrace{\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{2}}\right)}_{\begin{array}{c}
\text { Rate of } \mathrm{O}_{2} \\
\text { leaving the } \\
\text { alveoli }
\end{array}}
$$

(NE 31-20)

Here, $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the mole fraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the inspired air, and $\mathrm{FA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the mole fraction of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in the expired alveolar air. Substituting the expressions for $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (see Equation NE 31-19) and $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (see Equation NE 31-20) into the definition of RQ (see Equation NE 31-18), we have

$$
\mathrm{RQ}=\frac{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}}{\left(\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}}\right)-\left(\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O 2}} \times \dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}\right)}=\frac{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}} \times \underbrace{\left(\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}}\right)-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}}
$$

(NE 31-21)

We now need an expression for the ratio $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}} \dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}$. In the derivation of this expression, the fundamental assumption is that the $N_{2}$ gas in the lungs is not metabolized. Thus, in the steady state, the amount of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ entering the alveoli with inspirations over a certain period of time is the same as the amount of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ leaving the alveoli with the expirations over the same period. In other words,

$$
\underset{\substack{\text { Amount of } \mathrm{N}_{2} \\ \text { O}_{2} \\ \text { atient of } \mathrm{N}_{2}}}{\stackrel{\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}} \times \mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}}{\text { Amount of } \mathrm{N}_{2}}}
$$

Here, $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ is the mole fraction of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in this inspired gas, and $\mathrm{FA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ is the mole fraction of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ in the expired alveolar air. For the rest of this derivation, we will consider only dry gases; the laboratory reports all partial pressure ( P ) and mole fraction ( F ) values in terms of the "dry" gas (see Box 26-1). Thus, considering only the dry inspired air, the mole fractions of $\mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ must sum to 1 :

$$
\begin{gathered}
1=\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}+\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \\
\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}=1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}
\end{gathered}
$$

Because the inspired air contains virtually no $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \cong 0$ ),

$$
\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}=1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}
$$

(NE 31-24)
Similarly, considering only the dry expired air, the mole fractions of $\mathrm{N}_{2}, \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ must likewise sum to 1 :

$$
\begin{gathered}
1=\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{N_{2}}}+\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}+\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}} \\
\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{A}_{N_{2}}}=1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}
\end{gathered}
$$

If we now substitute the expressions for $\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ (see Equation NE 31-24) and $\mathrm{FA}_{\mathrm{N}_{2}}$ (see Equation NE 31-25) into Equation NE $31-22$, we have

$$
\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}} \times\left(1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)=\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}} \times\left(1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\right)
$$

(NE 31-26)
Solving for the ratio of inspired to expired alveolar ventilation yields

$$
\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}}}{\dot{\mathrm{~V}}_{\mathrm{A}_{E}}}=\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}
$$

(NE 31-27)
We now have the ratio $\mathrm{IV}_{\mathrm{A}_{1}} \mathrm{IV}_{\mathrm{A}_{2}}$ that we needed for Equation NE 31-21. Substituting Equation NE 31-27 into Equation NE $31-21$, we get

$$
\mathrm{RQ}=\frac{\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}} \times\left(\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}\right)-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}}
$$

(NE 31-28)
If we now solve Equation NE 31-28 for $\mathrm{FA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, we have

$$
\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}=\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\left[\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}\right]
$$

(NE 31-29)
Realizing that the "dry" partial pressure ( P ) is the product of mole fraction (the above F terms) and ( $\mathrm{Pb}-47$ ), we can multiply Equation NE 31-12 through by $(\mathrm{Pb}-47)$ to arrive at our final equation, which expresses quantities in terms of partial pressures:

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}\left[\mathrm{~F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}+\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}\right]
$$

(NE 31-30)
Remember, all the partial-pressure and mole-fraction values in the above equation refer to dry gases. Thus, $\mathrm{Pb}_{\mathrm{b}_{2}}$ is $\mathrm{Fb}_{\mathrm{b}_{2}} \times$ $(\mathrm{Pb}-47)$.

On page 681, we provide a simplified version of Equation NE 31-30:

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{O_{2}}}=\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}-\frac{\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}}{\mathrm{RQ}}
$$

(NE 31-31)
Why is this equation a reasonable approximation? Examination of Equations NE 31-30 and NE 31-31 shows that they are identical

# N31-8 The Alveolar Gas Equation-cont'd 

except that the term in brackets in Equation NE 31-30 is replaced by $1 / R Q$ in Equation NE 31-31. For Equation NE 31-30, we can rearrange the term in brackets as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& {\left[\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}+\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}}{R Q}\right]=\left[\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2} \frac{R Q}{R Q}+\frac{1-\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}}{R Q}\right]} \\
& =\left[\frac{\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}-R Q+1-\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}}{R Q}\right] \quad \text { (NE 31-32) } \\
& =\left[\frac{\mathrm{F}_{1 / 2}(R Q-1 / 2+1}{R Q}\right] \quad \text { (NE 31-33) }
\end{aligned}
$$

Under physiological conditions-when $F_{1 / 2}$ is 0.21 and $R Q$ is 0.8 -the above expression evaluates to $0.958 / R Q$, which is quite close to $1 / R Q \ldots$ which is to say that Equation NE 31-31 is a reasonable approximation of Equation 31-30 under these conditions.

When RQ is unity, the term in brackets in Equation 31-30 evaluates to unity, and Equation NE 31-30 simplifies to Equation 31-16 in the text:

$$
\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{1 / 2}}=\mathrm{P}_{1 / 2}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{A}_{1 / 2}}
$$

Figure 31-5 Distribution of ventilation. (Data from West JB: Respiratory Physiology—The Essentials, 4th ed. Baltimore, Williams \& Wilkins, 1990.)

This sort of analysis shows that alveolar ventilation in a standing person gradually falls from the base to the apex of the lung (see Fig. 31-5B). Why? The answers are posture and gravity. In Chapter 27 we saw that, because of the lung's weight, intrapleural pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}\right)$ is more negative at the apex than at the base when the subject is upright (see Fig. 31-5C). The practical consequences of this $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient become clear when we examine a static pressure-volume diagram not for the lungs as a whole (see Fig. 27-5), but rather for a small piece of lung (see Fig. 31-5D). We assume that the intrinsic mechanical properties of the airways are the same, regardless of whether the tissue is at the base or at the apex. At the base, where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ might be only $-2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ at FRC, the alveoli are relatively underinflated compared to tissues at the apex, where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ might be $-10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ and the alveoli are relatively overinflated. However, because the base of the lung is underinflated at FRC, it is on a steeper part of the pressure-volume curve (i.e., it has a greater static compliance) than the overinflated apex. Thus, during an inspiration, the same $\Delta \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ (e.g., $2.5 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ) produces a larger $\Delta \mathrm{V}_{1}$ near the base than near the apex. Keep in mind that it is the
change in volume per unit time, not the initial volume, that defines ventilation.

The relationship between ventilation and basal versus apical location in the lung would be reversed if the subject hung by the knees from a trapeze. A person reclining on the right side would ventilate the dependent lung tissue on the right side better than the elevated lung tissue on the left. Of course, the right-to-left $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient in the reclining subject would be smaller than the apex-to-base $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradient in the standing subject, reflecting the smaller distance (i.e., smaller hydrostatic pressure difference). Subjects under microgravity conditions (see p. 1233), such as astronauts aboard the International Space Station, experience no $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ gradients, and thus no gravity-dependent regional differences in ventilation.

## Restrictive and obstructive pulmonary diseases can exacerbate the nonuniformity of ventilation

Even in microgravity, where we would expect no regional differences in ventilation, ventilation would still be nonuniform

A REDUCE COMPLJANCE OF ONE LUNG TO HALF NORMAL

at the microscopic or local level because of seemingly random differences in local static compliance (C) and airway resistance (R). In fact, such local differences in the ventilation of alveolar units are probably more impressive than gravitydependent regional differences. Moreover, pathological changes in compliance and resistance can substantially increase the local differences and thus the nonuniformity of ventilation. (○) N31-9

Restrictive Pulmonary Disease As discussed in Box 27-1, restrictive pulmonary diseases include disorders that decrease the static compliance of alveoli (e.g., fibrosis) as well as disorders that limit the expansion of the lung (e.g., pulmonary effusion). Figure 31-6A shows a hypothetical example in which R is normal and disease has halved the static compliance of one lung but left the other unaffected. (○) N31-10 Thus, for the usual change in $\mathrm{P}_{0}$, the final volume change $(\Delta \mathrm{V})$ of the diseased lung is only half normal, so that its ventilation is also halved. Because the ventilation of the other unit is normal, decreased local compliance has increased the nonuniformity of ventilation.

Obstructive Pulmonary Disease As discussed in Box 27-2, obstructive pulmonary diseases include disorders (e.g., asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]) that increase the resistance of conducting airways. Scar tissue or a local mass, such as a neoplasm, can also occlude a conducting airway or compress it from the outside. Even if the effect is not sufficiently severe to increase overall airway resistance, a local increase in R causes an increase in the time constant $\tau$ (○) N31-10 for filling or emptying the affected alveoli (see Fig. 31-6B, lower curve). An isolated increase in R will not affect $\Delta \mathrm{V}$ if sufficient time is available for the inspiration. However, if sufficient time is not available, then
alveoli with an elevated $\tau$ will not completely fill or empty, and their ventilation will decrease. Of course, the mismatching of ventilation between the two units worsens as respiratory frequency increases, as we saw in our discussion of dynamic compliance (see p. 624).

## PERFUSION OF THE LUNG

## The pulmonary circulation has low pressure and resistance but high compliance

The pulmonary circulatory system handles the same cardiac output as the systemic circulation, but in a very different way. The systemic circulation is a high-pressure system. This high pressure is necessary to pump blood to the top of the brain while the individual is standing, or even to a maximally elevated fingertip. The systemic circulation also needs to be a high-pressure system because it is a high-resistance system. It uses this high resistance to control the distribution of blood flow. Thus, at rest, a substantial fraction of the systemic capillaries are closed, which gives the system the flexibility to redistribute large amounts of blood (e.g., to muscle during exercise). The mean pressure of the aorta is $\sim 95 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (Table 31-1). At the opposite end of the circuit is the right atrium, which has a mean pressure of $\sim 2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, the driving pressure for blood flow through the systemic circulation is $\sim 93 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Given a cardiac output (Q) of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ or $83 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{s}$, we can compute the resistance of the systemic system using an equation like Ohm's law (see Equation 17-10):

$$
\begin{aligned}
\mathrm{R}_{\text {systemic }} & =\frac{\Delta \mathrm{P}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{93 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}}{83 \mathrm{mLblood} / \mathrm{s}} \\
& =1.1 \mathrm{PRU}
\end{aligned}
$$

# N31-9 Detecting Nonuniformity of Ventilation 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

We have already seen how ${ }^{133} \mathbf{X e}$ scanning can be useful in detecting the physiological nonuniformity of ventilation. Obviously, because of limitations in scanning technology, ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ scans are helpful only if sufficiently large regions of the lung have sufficiently large differences in ventilation. However, a ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ scan might not detect a nonuniformity of ventilation in which many small, well-ventilated airways are intermingled with many, small poorly ventilated airways. Two other approaches that we have mentioned in other contexts would detect such a nonuniformity of ventilation.

The first is the single-breath $\mathbf{N}_{2}$-washout technique, which we introduced in our discussion of the Fowler method for measuring anatomical dead space (see p. 675). In this approach, the subject inhales one breath of $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, and we assume that the inspired $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ distributes evenly throughout all the alveoli of the lungs. If ventilation is indeed uniform, the inspired $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dilutes alveolar $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ uniformly in all regions of the lung. Thus, when the subject exhales, the air emerging from the alveolar air spaces should have a uniform $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$, and the plateau of the single-breath $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ washout should be flat, as shown by the red curve in Figure 31-2C labeled "Pure alveolar air."

However, if the alveoli are unevenly ventilated, the inhaled $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ will not be distributed uniformly throughout the lungs and therefore will not uniformly dilute the pre-existing alveolar $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Regions of the lung that are relatively hypoventilated will receive relatively less $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ during the single inspiration, so that they will be relatively poor in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ but rich in $\mathrm{N}_{2}$. Conversely, hyperventilated regions will receive relatively more of the inhaled $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ and hence will be $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ rich and $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ poor. During the expiration, we no longer observe a plateau for $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$. Why? After exhalation of the anatomical dead space, the first
alveolar air out of the lungs is dominated by the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-rich/ $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-poor gas coming from the relatively hyperventilated airwayswhich inflate and deflate relatively quickly. As the expiration continues, the alveolar air gradually becomes dominated more and more by the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-poor/ $\mathrm{N}_{2}$-rich gas from the hypoventilated airways, which inflate and deflate relatively slowly. Because of this shift from hyperventilated to hypoventilated regions, the $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ gradually creeps upward-that is, there is no clear plateau-in subjects with a sufficiently high nonuniformity of ventilation.

A second test for unevenness of ventilation is the 7-minute $\mathbf{N}_{2}$ washout. We saw in Chapter 26 how to compute lung volume from the volume of distribution of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ (see p. 602). The general approach is for a subject to inhale $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, allow that $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to dilute the pre-existing alveolar $\mathrm{N}_{2}$, and then exhale into a collection container. If this breathing pattern is continued for a standard period of 7 minutes, and if ventilation is evenly distributed, virtually all of the pre-existing $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ washes out of the lungs (see Fig. 26-9B). We already learned that, from the amount of $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ washed into the collection container, we can compute $V_{c}$. However, we can also use this experiment to assess the evenness of ventilation. In a normal individual, the mean alveolar $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ in the expired air is $<2.5 \%$ after 7 minutes of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ breathing. However, if some airways are poorly ventilated, their $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ will not be washed out as well after 7 minutes of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ breathing, so that the $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ in these hypoventilated airways may be substantially greater than $2.5 \%$. Because these hypoventilated airways contribute to the total expired alveolar air, the mean expired alveolar $\left[\mathrm{N}_{2}\right]$ after 7 minutes will be elevated. Obviously, the degree of elevation depends on the volume of hypoventilated airways and the extent of their hypoventilation.

# N31-10 Effect of Changes in Compliance on the Time Constant Governing Changes in Lung Volume 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

On page 622, we saw that, during inspiration and expiration, the time course of lung volume $\left(V_{L}\right)$ is approximately exponential. The time constant $(\tau)$ for the change in $V_{L}\left(\Delta V_{L}\right)$ is the time required for the change in $V_{L}$ to be $-63 \%$ complete. Moreover, (C) N27-18 explains why $\tau$ is the product of airway resistance (R) and alveolar compliance (C):

$$
\tau=R \times C
$$

## Decreased Compliance

In the example discussed under restrictive pulmonary disease on page 683, we decreased the compliance of one lung by half. Of course, other things being equal, the $\Delta V$ of the affected lung will be half normal, as illustrated in Figure 31-6A. What is not so obvious is that $\tau$ of the affected lung will also be half normal. In other words, the lung with half-normal compliance will achieve its final volume twice as fast as normal. The reason is that, with a normal airway resistance, the inhaled air-at any instant in time-will flow at a more-or-less normal rate, so that the affected lung achieves its half-normal $\Delta V$ earlier than the normal lung.

Although it might seem that the decreased $\tau$ in this example is a good thing, the problem is that the reduced $\Delta V$ translates to less ventilation, and that is not a good thing. As described in the text, this reduced ventilation increases the nonuniformity of ventilation, which in turn-as discussed below in this chapter-tends to lead to hypoxia and respiratory acidosis.

## Increased Compliance

What would be the effect of increasing the static compliance of one lung? A disease that increases the static compliance is
emphysema (see Fig. 27-5). Other things being equal, an increase in compliance will cause the $\Delta V$ of the affected lung to be greater than normal. At the same time, the $\tau$ of the affected lung will also be increased. The reason is that, with a normal airway resistance, the inhaled air-at any instant in time-will flow at a more-or-less normal rate, so that the affected lung achieves its greater-than-normal $\Delta V$ later than a normal lung. If $\tau$ is too large, then the time that the person allows for inspiration may not be long enough for the affected lung to increase its volume to the level that it could achieve if the inspiration were infinitely long. As a result, the inspiration will be truncated, and the true $\Delta V$ for the affected lung will be less than normal, thereby exacerbating the unevenness of ventilation. Moreover, the greater the respiratory frequency, the greater the truncation of the inspiration, and thus the greater the exacerbation of the unevenness of ventilation.

Figure 27-15A illustrates the effect of increased airway resistance on the time course of $V_{L}$, and Figure 27-15B illustrates the effect on the change in lung volume, which is proportional to dynamic compliance. In the example in Figure 27-15, the static compliance was normal and the final $\Delta V$ was the same for the normal and affected lung. The example we are discussing in this webnote is just the opposite (i.e., a normal airway resistance but altered compliance). Nevertheless, the principle of how increases in $\tau$ affect ventilation is the same: the greater the $\tau$, the greater the chance that increased respiratory frequency will lead to a truncated inspiration and thus a greater unevenness of ventilation.

Although we have focused on inspiration in these examples, the same principles apply to expiration, namely, the greater the $\tau$, the greater the chance of a truncated expiration.

In contrast, the pulmonary circulation is a low-pressure system. It can afford to be a low-pressure system because it needs to pump blood only to the top of the lung. Moreover, it must be a low-pressure system to avoid the consequences of Starling forces (see pp. 467-468), which would otherwise flood the lung with edema fluid. The mean pressure in the pulmonary artery is only $\sim 15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Because the mean pressure of the left atrium, at the other end of the circuit, is $\sim 8 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, and because the cardiac output of the right heart is the same as for the left, we have

Thus, the total resistance of the pulmonary circulation is less than one tenth that of the systemic system, which explains how the pulmonary circulation accomplishes its mission at such low pressures. Unlike in the systemic circulation, where most of the pressure drop occurs in the arterioles (i.e., between the terminal arteries and beginning of the capillaries), in the pulmonary circulation almost the entire pressure drop occurs rather uniformly between the pulmonary artery and the end of the capillaries. In particular, the arterioles make a much smaller contribution to resistance in the pulmonary circulation than in the systemic circulation.

What are the properties of the pulmonary vasculature that give it such a low resistance? First, let us examine the complete circuit. The pulmonary artery arises from the right ventricle, bifurcates, and carries relatively deoxygenated blood to each lung. The two main branches of the pulmonary artery follow the two mainstem bronchi into the lungs and bifurcate along with the bronchi and bronchioles. A single pulmonary arteriole supplies all of the capillaries of a terminal respiratory unit (see p. 597). Together, the two lungs have $\sim 300$ million alveoli. However, they may have as many as 280 billion highly anastomosing capillary segments (each looking like the edge of a hexagon in a piece of chicken wire), or nearly 1000 such capillary segments per alveoluscreating a surface for gas exchange of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$. It is easy to imagine why some have described the pulmonary capillary bed as a nearly continuous flowing sheet of blood surrounding the alveoli. At rest, the erythrocytes spend $\sim 0.75$ second navigating this capillary bed, which contains $\sim 75 \mathrm{~mL}$ of blood. During exercise, capillary blood volume may increase to $\sim 200 \mathrm{~mL}$. Pulmonary venules collect the oxygenated blood from the capillary network, converge, course between the lobules, converge some more, and eventually enter the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. The total circulation time through the pulmonary system is 4 to 5 seconds.

Pulmonary blood vessels are generally shorter and wider than their counterparts on the systemic side. Arterioles are also present in much higher numbers in the pulmonary circulation. Although the pulmonary arterioles contain smooth muscle and can constrict, these vessels are far less muscular than their systemic counterparts, and their resting tone is low. These properties combine to produce a system with an unusually low resistance.

The walls of pulmonary vessels have another key property: thinness, like the walls of veins elsewhere in the body. The thin walls and paucity of smooth muscle give the pulmonary vessels a high compliance, which has three consequences. First, pulmonary vessels can accept the relatively large amounts of blood that shift from the legs to the lungs when a person changes from a standing to a recumbent position. Second, as we discuss below, the high compliance also allows the vessels to dilate in response to modest increases in pulmonary arterial pressure. Third, the pulse pressure in the pulmonary system is rather low (on an absolute scale). The systolic/diastolic pressures in the pulmonary artery are typically $25 / 8 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, yielding a pulse pressure of $\sim 17 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. In contrast, the systolic/diastolic pressures in the aorta are $\sim 120 / 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, for a pulse pressure of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Nonetheless, relative to the mean pulmonary artery pressure of 15 mm Hg , the pulmonary pulse pressure of 17 mm Hg is quite high.

## Overall pulmonary vascular resistance is minimal at FRC

Because pulmonary blood vessels are so compliant, they are especially susceptible to deformation by external forces. These forces are very different for vessels that are surrounded by alveoli (i.e., "alveolar" vessels) compared with those that are not (i.e., "extra-alveolar" vessels). In both types, the key consideration is whether these external forces pull vessels open or crush them.

Alveolar Vessels Alveolar vessels include the capillaries, as well as slightly larger vessels that are also surrounded on all sides by alveoli (Fig. 31-7A). The resistance of these alveolar vessels depends on both the transmural pressure gradient and lung volume.

We have already introduced the transmural pressure gradient $\left(\mathbf{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}\right)$ in our discussions of systemic blood vessels (see p. 414) and conducting airways (see pp. 624-625). For alveolar vessels, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ is the difference between the pressure in the vessel lumen and that in the surrounding alveoli (PA).

B DEPENDENCE OF VASCULAR RESISTANCE ON LUNG VOLUME
![bo121465312c5](bo121465312c5.jpg)

Figure 31-7 Pulmonary vascular resistance. (B, Data from Murray JF: The Normal Lung, 2nd ed. Philadelphia, WB Saunders, 1986.)

For simplicity, we consider the factors affecting $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ at a fixed lung volume.

The pressure inside these vessels varies with the cardiac cycle; indeed, the pulmonary capillary bed is one of the few in which flow is pulsatile (see p. 513). The pressure inside the alveolar vessels also depends greatly on their vertical position relative to the left atrium: the higher the vessel, the lower the pressure.

The pressure in the alveoli varies with the respiratory cycle. With no airflow and the glottis open, PA is the same as Pb (i.e., $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ ). On the other hand, PA is negative during inspiration and positive during expiration. A combination of a high intravascular pressure and a negative PA tends to dilate the compliant alveolar vessels, lowering their resistance. But a combination of a low intravascular pressure and a positive PA crushes these vessels, raising their resistance.

Changes in lung volume $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$ have characteristic effects on alveolar vessels. For simplicity, here we assume that each time we examine a new $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$, airflow has stopped, so that PA is zero. As $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases, the alveolar walls become more stretched out. Consequently, the alveolar vessels become stretched along their longitudinal axis but crushed when viewed in cross section. Both of these effects tend to raise vessel resistance. Thus, as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases, the resistance of the alveolar vessels also increases (see Fig. 31-7B, red curve).

Extra-Alveolar Vessels Because they are not surrounded by alveoli, the extra-alveolar vessels are sensitive to intrapleural pressure (see Fig. 31-7A). Again for simplicity, we examine the effect of changing $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ after airflow has already stopped. The increasingly negative values of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ needed to achieve increasingly higher lung volumes also increase the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ of the extra-alveolar vessels and tend to dilate them. Thus as $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ increases, the resistance of the extra-alveolar vessels decreases (see Fig. 31-7B, blue curve).

In summary, increases in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ tend to crush alveolar vessels and thus increase their resistance, but to expand
extra-alveolar vessels and thus decrease their resistance. The net effect on overall pulmonary vascular resistance of increasing $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ from residual volume (RV) to TLC is biphasic (see Fig. 31-7B, violet curve). Starting at RV, an increase in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ first causes pulmonary vascular resistance to fall as the dilation of extra-alveolar vessels dominates. Pulmonary vascular resistance reaches its minimum value at about FRC. Further increases in $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ (as during a normal inspiration) increase overall resistance as the crushing of alveolar vessels dominates. (○) N31-11

## Increases in pulmonary arterial pressure reduce pulmonary vascular resistance by recruiting and distending pulmonary capillaries

Although the pulmonary circulation is normally a lowresistance system under resting conditions, it has a remarkable ability to lower its resistance even further. During exercise, 2-fold to 3-fold increases in cardiac output may elicit only a minor increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure. In other words, a slight increase in pulmonary arterial pressure is somehow able to markedly decrease resistance (Fig. 31-8A) and thus markedly increase flow (see Fig. 31-8B). This behavior is a general property of a passive/elastic vascular bed (see Fig. 19-7A, red curve). Two "passive" mechanisms-that is, mechanisms not related to "active" changes in the tone of vascular smooth muscle-are at work here: the recruitment and distention of pulmonary capillaries. However, before we can understand either change, we must more completely describe the pulmonary capillaries at "rest."

Under "resting" conditions (i.e., at relatively low values of pulmonary arterial pressure), some pulmonary capillaries are open and conducting blood, others are open but not conducting substantial amounts of blood, and still others are closed (see Fig. 31-8C). Why should some capillaries be open but have no flow? In a highly anastomosing capillary network, tiny differences in driving pressure might exist. In addition,

# N31-11 Additional Factors Affecting the Resistance of Pulmonary Vessels 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

## Alveolar Vessels

On pages 684-685 we pointed out that two major factors affect the caliber of alveolar vessels (i.e., vessels surrounded by alveoli): (1) transmural pressure and (2) lung volume $\left(V_{L}\right)$ per se. The cardiac cycle and the respiratory cycle are two factors that can affect the transmural pressure of alveolar vessels. A third factor is an indirect effect of increasing lung volume. (This indirect effect is in addition to the direct effect of increasing $V_{L}$, which stretches the vessels longitudinally and crushes them as they are viewed in cross section.) Let us compare two static conditions: resting at FRC, and holding lung volume at TLC. In order to achieve the higher lung volume, we needed to shift $P_{S P}$ in the negative direction. As discussed on page 685, this decrease in $P_{S P}$ dilates extra-alveolar vessels. Because the volume of these vessels increases, the pressure falls inside all the vessels in the thorax. This decrease in intravascular pressure at negative $P_{S P}$
values accentuates the collapse of the alveolar vessels at high lung volumes.

## Extra-Alveolar Vessels

On page 685, we considered only static conditions. What happens when-starting at TLC (where the $P_{S P}$ at rest is very negative)-one makes a maximal expiratory effort? Instantly, $P_{S P}$ becomes very positive, tending to collapse the extra-alveolar vessels, just as this maneuver tends to collapse conducting airways (see pp. 624-626). However, the mechanical tethering (or radial traction) of other structures on the extra-alveolar vessels tends to oppose their collapse, just as-at a high $V_{L}$-mechanical tethering tends to keep conducing airways open during expiration. However, the effects of mechanical tethering decrease as $V_{L}$ falls during expiration.

C RECRUITMENT AND DISTENTION OF ALVEOLAR VESSELS

Figure 31-8 Effects of perfusion pressure on pulmonary hemodynamics.
seemingly random differences in the dimensions of parallel capillaries may lead to differences in resistance. In lowpressure systems, such slight differences in absolute resistance allow pathways with relatively low resistances to steal flow from neighbors with slightly higher resistances, leaving some "open" pathways heavily underutilized. A familiar example is a type of garden hose used to drizzle water on a flower bed; this hose is closed at its distal end, but perforated with hundreds of tiny holes. If water pressure is low, only some of the holes conduct water.

Why should some parallel vessels be closed? Popping open a previously closed vessel requires that the perfusion pressure overcome the tone of the vascular smooth muscle
and reach that vessel's critical closing pressure (see p. 454), which varies from vessel to vessel. As we discuss below, alveolar vessels also may be closed because the alveolar pressure exceeds intravascular pressure, thereby crushing the vessel.

Recruitment Imagine that the pressure inside a pulmonary arteriole starts out at a fairly low level. As pressure increases, some vessels that were completely closed may now open (see Fig. 31-8C). Similarly, capillaries that previously had been open but not conducting now begin to conduct blood. The greater the increase in perfusion pressure, the greater the number of open and conducting vessels. This

recruitment of additional parallel capillary pathways reduces overall vascular resistance.

Distention Once a vessel is open and conducting, further pressure increases will increase $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ and thus cause the vessel to dilate (see Fig. 31-8C). The net effect is a reduction in overall pulmonary resistance. Although a pressure increase can simultaneously recruit and distend various vessels, distention probably tends to occur later; that is, distention is the primary mechanism for lowering resistance under conditions in which the initial pressure was already relatively high.

## Hypoxia is a strong vasoconstrictor, opposite to its effect in the systemic circulation

In addition to lung volume and perfusion pressure, several other factors can modulate pulmonary vascular resistance.

Oxygen The effects of changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH on pulmonary vascular resistance are opposite to those observed in the systemic circulation. Thus, hypoxia causes pulmonary vasoconstriction. What appears to be critical is not so much the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the lumen of the arterioles and venules, but rather the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the alveolar air adjacent to the vessel. Indeed, perfusing the pulmonary vasculature with a hypoxic solution is far less effective than ventilating the airways with a low- $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ air mixture.

Hypoxic vasoconstriction occurs in isolated lung tissue and thus does not rely on either the nervous system or systemic hormones. Rather, the low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is generally believed to act directly on the pulmonary vascular smooth-muscle cells. How this occurs is unknown, but hypothesized mechanisms include all those proposed for the sensing of hypoxia by the peripheral chemoreceptor, which we discuss on page 712. Somehow, the hypoxia inhibits one or more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, causing the membrane potential of vascular smooth-muscle cells to move away from the equilibrium potential for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ $\left(E_{\mathrm{K}}\right)$. This depolarization opens voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, leading to an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and smooth-muscle contraction (see p. 247).

Carbon Dioxide and Low pH High $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ or low interstitial pH promotes vasoconstriction, although with far less potency than hypoxia. Elevated $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ may produce its effect by decreasing the pH of either the extracellular or intracellular fluid. Following a general pattern that is repeated in the control of ventilation (see p. 716), hypoxia makes the vascular smooth-muscle cells more sensitive to respiratory acidosis.

Autonomic Nervous System The sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation of the pulmonary vasculature is far less impressive than that of the systemic circulation. Increased sympathetic tone seems to reduce the compliance of (i.e., stiffen) the pulmonary artery walls without increasing resistance per se. Increased parasympathetic tone causes a mild vasodilation, the relevance of which is unknown.

Hormones and Other Humoral Agents The pulmonary blood vessels are relatively unresponsive to hormones and other signaling molecules. Table 31-2 summarizes the actions of some factors that modify pulmonary vascular resistance.

## Because of gravity, regional perfusion in an upright subject is far greater near the base than the apex of the lung

When it comes to perfusion-as with ventilation-not all alveoli are created equal. First of all, microscopic or local differences in pulmonary vascular resistance lead to corresponding local differences in perfusion. Of course, pathological processes can exacerbate these differences. In addition, gravity causes large regional differences in perfusion that we can assess by using a ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ imaging technique. In Figure 31-5A, we used the inhalation of ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ gas to measure the uniformity of ventilation. In Figure 31-9A, we equilibrate a saline solution with a gas mixture containing ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ and then inject the solution intravenously as the patient holds his or her breath. When the ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ reaches the lungs, it rapidly enters the alveolar air, inasmuch as Xe is poorly soluble in water. A lung scan reveals the distribution of radioactivity, which now reflects the regional uniformity of perfusion. If we normalize the ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ to account for differences in regional lung volumeas we did for the ventilation scan-then we can obtain a graph showing how blood flow varies from the bottom to the top of the lung of an upright subject.

The results of such a ${ }^{133} \mathrm{Xe}$ perfusion study show that when the patient is upright, perfusion $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$ is greatest near the base of the lungs and falls toward low levels near the apex (see Fig. 31-9B). Note that although regional $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is highest near the base of the lung, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ falls off somewhat from this peak as we approach the extreme base. With exercise, perfusion increases in all regions of the lung, but more so near the apex, so that the nonuniformity of perfusion is less.

Why should $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ have this peculiar height dependence? The basic answers are the same as those for the similar question we raised about the regional nonuniformity of ventilation: posture and gravity. Thus, standing on your head will reverse the flow-height relationship, and we would expect height-related differences in flow to be minimal in microgravity conditions.

Figure 31-9C shows how we can divide the upright lung into four zones based on the relationships among various

Figure 31-9 Physiological nonuniformity of pulmonary perfusion.

pressures. We define the first three zones based on how alveolar blood vessels are affected by the relative values of three different pressures: alveolar pressure ( PA ), the pressure inside pulmonary arterioles $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}\right)$, and the pressure inside pulmonary venules ( $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ ). In the fourth zone, we instead focus on how extra-alveolar vessels are affected by intrapleural pressure $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}\right)$.

Zone 1: $\mathrm{PA}>\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}>\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ These conditions prevail at the apex of the lung under certain circumstances. The defining characteristic of a zone 1 alveolar vessel is that $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ are so low that they have fallen below PA.

At the level of the left atrium (the reference point for the pressure measurements), the mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ is $\sim 15 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Table 31-1), which-because mercury is 13.6 -fold more dense than water-corresponds to $\sim 20 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 31-9C, lower illustration for zone 3). Similarly, mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ is $\sim 8 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, or $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. As we move upward closer to the apex of an upright lung, the actual pressures in the lumens of pulmonary arterioles and venules fall by 1 cm $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for each 1 cm of vertical ascent. In the hypothetical case in which alveoli at the lung apex are 20 cm above the level of the left atrium, the mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ of these alveoli would be $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ (see Fig. 31-9C, zone 1). The corresponding $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ would be about $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. The pressure inside the pulmonary capillary $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}}\right)$ would be intermediate, perhaps -5 cm $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$. In principle, blood would still flow through this capillary-the driving pressure would be $\sim 10 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ were it not for the pressure inside the surrounding alveoli, which is $0 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ between breaths. Therefore, because PA is much higher than $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{C}}$, the negative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ (see p. 414) would tend to crush the capillary and reduce blood flow.

Fortunately, zone 1 conditions do not exist for normal people at rest. However, they can arise if there is either a sufficient decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ (e.g., in hemorrhage) or a sufficient increase in PA (e.g., in positive-pressure ventilation).

Zone 2: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}>\mathrm{PA}>\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ These conditions normally prevail from the apex to the mid-lung. The defining characteristic of zone 2 is that mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ are high enough so that they sandwich PA (see Fig. 31-9C, zone 2). Thus, at the arteriolar end, the positive $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ causes the alveolar vessel to dilate. Further down the capillary, though, luminal pressure gradually falls below PA, so that the negative $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ squeezes the vessel, raising resistance and thus reducing flow. As we move downward in zone 2, the crushing force decreases because the hydrostatic pressures in the arteriole, capillary, and venule all rise in parallel by $1 \mathrm{~cm} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for each 1 cm of descent (see Fig. 31-9C, upper $\rightarrow$ lower illustrations for zone 2). Simultaneously, resistance decreases. The conversion of a closed vessel (or one that is open but not conducting) to a conducting one by increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ is an example of recruitment.

Zone 3: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}>\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}>\mathrm{PA}$ These conditions prevail in the middle to lower lung. The defining characteristic of zone 3 is that mean $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ are so high that they both exceed PA (see Fig. 31-9C, zone 3). Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ is positive along the entire length of the alveolar vessel, tending to dilate it. As we move downward in zone 3, the hydrostatic pressures in the arteriole, capillary, and venule all continue to rise by 1 cm
$\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$ for each 1 cm of descent. Because PA between breaths does not vary with height in the lung, the gradually increasing pressure of the alveolar vessel produces a greater and greater $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$, causing the vessel to dilate more and more-an example of distention (see Fig. 31-9C, upper $\rightarrow$ lower illustrations for zone 3). This distention causes a gradual decrease in resistance of the capillaries as we move downward in zone 3. Hence, although the driving force $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}\right)$ remains constant, perfusion increases toward the base of the lung.

The arrangement in which a variable $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{TM}}$ controls flow is known as a Starling resistor. Keep in mind that the driving force $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}\right)$ is constant in all of the zones.

Zone 4: $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}>\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}>\mathrm{PA}$ These conditions prevail at the extreme base of the lungs. In zone 4, the alveolar vessels behave as in zone 3; they dilate more as we descend toward the base of the lung. However, the extra-alveolar vessels behave differently. At the base of the lung, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is least negative (see Fig. 31-5C). Thus, as we approach the extreme base of the lung, the distending forces acting on the extra-alveolar blood vessels fade, and the resistance of these extra-alveolar vessels increases (see Fig. 31-9C, zone 4). Recall that we saw a similar effect-at the level of the whole lung (see Fig. 31-7B, blue curve)-where resistance of the extra-alveolar vessels increased as lung volume fell (i.e., as $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ became less negative). Because these extra-alveolar vessels feed or drain the alveolar vessels, $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ begins to fall from its peak as we approach the extreme base of the lungs (see Fig. 31-9B).

These lung zones are physiological, not anatomical. The boundaries between the zones are neither fixed nor sharp. For example, the boundaries can move downward with positive-pressure ventilation (which increases PA) and can move upward with exercise (which increases $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ ). In our discussion of lung zones, we have tacitly assumed that PA is always zero and that the values of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PA}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PV}}$ are stable and depend only on height in the lung. In real life, of course, things are more complicated. During the respiratory cycle, PA becomes negative during inspiration (promoting dilation of alveolar vessels) but positive during expiration. During the cardiac cycle, the pressure inside the arterioles and pulmonary capillaries is greatest during systole (promoting dilation of the vessel) and lowest during diastole. Thus, we would expect blood flow through an alveolar vessel to be greatest when inspiration coincides with systole.

## MATCHING VENTILATION AND PERFUSION

## The greater the ventilation-perfusion ratio, the higher the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{D}}$, and the lower the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the alveolar air

In Figure 31-4 we saw that, all other factors being equal, alveolar ventilation determines alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The greater the ventilation, the more closely $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ approach their respective values in inspired air. However, in Figure 31-4 we were really focusing on total alveolar ventilation and how this influences the average, or idealized, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. In fact, we have already learned that both ventilation and perfusion vary among alveoli. In any group of alveoli, the greater the local ventilation, the more closely the composition of local alveolar air approaches that of the inspired air. Similarly, because blood flow removes $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

| Overall | $100 \%$ | $0.84^{*}$ | 100 | 40 | 7.40 | 5.0 |

*Because the transport of both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is perfusion limited, we assume that end-capillary values of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ are the same as their respective alveolar values. If the overall alveolar ventilation for the two lungs is $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, and if the cardiac output (i.e., perfusion) is $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, then the overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio for the two lungs is ( $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ )( $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})=0.84$.

from the alveolar air and adds $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the greater the perfusion, the more closely the composition of local alveolar air approaches that of mixed-venous blood. Thus, the local ventilation-perfusion ratio $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}\right)$ determines the local $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

You might view the alveoli as a sports venue where ventilation and perfusion are engaged in a continuous struggle over control of the composition of alveolar air. To the extent that ventilation gains the upper hand, $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rises and $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls. To the extent that perfusion holds sway, these parameters change in the opposite direction.

As a physical analog of this struggle over control of alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, consider water flowing (analogous to $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ ) from a faucet into a sink (alveoli); the water exits $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$ through a drain with an adjustable opening. If the drain opening is in midposition and we begin flowing water moderately fast, then the water level $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ will gradually increase and reach a steady state. Increasing the inflow of water $\left(\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$ will cause the water level $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ to rise until the product of pressure head and drain conductance is high enough to drive water down the drain as fast as the water flows in. If we increase the drain opening and thus the outflow of water $(\dot{\mathrm{Q}})$, then the water level $\left(\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ will fall until the decrease in the pressure head matches the increase in drain conductance, so that once again water inflow and outflow are balanced. Just as a high faucet-drain ratio will raise the water level, a high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio will increase alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.

## Because of the action of gravity, the regional $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio in an upright subject is greater at the apex of the lung than at the base

We have already seen that when a subject is upright in a gravitational field, ventilation falls from the base to the apex of the lung (see Fig. 31-5B) and that perfusion also falls, but more steeply (see Fig. 31-9B). Thus, it is not surprising that the ratio $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ itself varies with height in the lung (Fig. 31-10A). $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is lowest near the base, where $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ exceeds $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$. The ratio gradually increases to 1 at about the level of the third rib and further increases toward the apex, where $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ falls more precipitously than $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$.

Table 31-3 shows how differences in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ at the apex and base of the lungs influence the regional composition of alveolar air. At the apex (the most rostral $7 \%$ of lung volume in this example), where $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is highest, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ most closely approach their values in inspired air. Because both $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport across the blood-gas barrier are perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ have completely equilibrated between the alveolar air and the blood by the end of the pulmonary capillaries. Thus, blood leaving the apex has the same high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ as the alveolar air. Of course, the relatively low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ produces a respiratory alkalosis (see p. 634) in the blood leaving the apex.

The situation is just the opposite near the base of the lung (the most caudal $13 \%$ of lung volume in this example).

Because $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ here is lowest, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ tend more toward their values in mixed-venous blood. What impact do these different regions of the lung, each with its own $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio, have on the composition of systemic arterial blood? Each region makes a contribution that is proportional to its blood flow (see the rightmost column in Table 31-3). Because the apex is poorly perfused, it makes only a small contribution to the overall composition of arterial blood. On the other hand, pulmonary tissue at the base of the lungs, which receives $\sim 26 \%$ of total cardiac output, makes a major contribution. As a result, the average composition of blood exiting the lung more closely reflects the composition of the blood that had equilibrated with the air in the base of the lung.

The $\mathbf{O}_{2}-\mathbf{C O}_{2}$ diagram introduced as Figure 29-11 is a helpful tool for depicting how different $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratios throughout the lung produce different blood-gas compositions. The curve in Figure 31-10B represents all possible combinations of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in the alveolar air or end-pulmonarycapillary blood. The $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$-saturated inspired air $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=149\right.$, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=-0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) represents the rightmost extreme of the diagram. By definition, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio of inspired air is $\infty$, because it does not come into contact with pulmonarycapillary blood. The mixed-venous blood $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=40, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\right.$ 46 mm Hg ) represents the other extreme. By definition, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio of mixed-venous blood is zero, because it has not yet come into contact with alveolar air. With the end points of the diagram established, we can now predict-with the help of the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17), the Bohr effect (see p. 652), and the Haldane effect (see p. 657)all possible combinations of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ throughout the lung. As shown in Figure 31-10B, the base, midportion, and apex of the lungs correspond to points along the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram between mixed-venous blood at one extreme and inspired air at the other.

The ventilation of unperfused alveoli (local $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}=\infty$ ) triggers compensatory bronchoconstriction and a fall in surfactant production

The effects of gravity on ventilation and perfusion cause regional $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to vary widely, even in idealized lungs (see Fig. 31-10A). However, microscopic or local physiological and pathological variations in ventilation and perfusion can cause even greater mismatches of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$, the extremes of which are alveolar dead-space ventilation (this section) and shunt (next section).

Alveolar Dead-Space Ventilation At one end of the spectrum of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches is the elimination of blood flow to a group of alveoli. For example, if we ligated the pulmonary artery feeding one lung, the affected alveoli would receive no perfusion even though ventilation would initially continue normally (Fig. 31-11A). Above, we saw that such alveolar dead space together with the anatomical dead space constitute the physiological dead space (see Equation 31-8). The ventilation of the unperfused alveoli is called alveolar dead-space ventilation because it does not contribute to gas exchange. Thus, these alveoli behave like conducting airways. (T) N31-12

A natural cause of alveolar dead-space ventilation is a pulmonary embolism, which obstructs blood flow to a group of alveoli. Because one task of the lung is to filter small emboli from the blood (see p. 600), the lung must deal with small regions of alveolar dead-space ventilation on a recurring basis. At the instant the blood flow ceases, the alveoli supplied by the affected vessel(s) contain normal alveolar air. However, each cycle of inspiration and expiration replaces some stale alveolar air with fresh, inspired air. Because no exchange of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ occurs between these unperfused alveoli and pulmonary-capillary blood, the alveolar gas

# N31-12 Notes on the Differences Between Anatomical and Physiological Dead Space 

Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

There is a fundamental difference between the anatomical and alveolar dead space. The conducting airways are in series with and upstream from (proximal to) the alveoli. The conducting airways have the composition of inspired air only after an inspiration; after an expiration, they have the composition of alveolar air. On the other hand, unperfused alveoli are in parallel with normal alveoli and have the composition of inspired air, regardless of the position in the respiratory cycle.

gradually achieves the composition of moist inspired air, with alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rising to $\sim 149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falling to $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Fig. 31-11A, step 2). By definition, alveolar dead space has a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratio of $\infty$, as described by the "Inspired air" point on the x -axis of an $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram (see Fig. 31-10B).

Redirection of Blood Flow Blocking blood flow to one group of alveoli diverts blood to other "normal" alveoli, which then become somewhat hyperperfused. Thus, the blockage not only increases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in alveoli downstream from the blockage, but also decreases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in other regions. Redirection of blood flow thus accentuates the nonuniformity of ventilation.

Regulation of Local Ventilation Because alveolar deadspace ventilation causes alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to fall to $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in downstream alveoli, it leads to a respiratory alkalosis (see p. 634) in the surrounding interstitial fluid. These local changes trigger a compensatory bronchiolar constriction in the adjacent tissues (see Fig. 31-11B), so that over a period of seconds to minutes, airflow partially diverts away from the unperfused alveoli and toward normal alveoli, to which blood flow is also being diverted. This compensation makes teleological sense, because it tends to correct the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ shift in both the unperfused and normal alveoli. The precise mechanism of bronchiolar constriction is unknown, although bronchiolar smooth muscle may contract-at least in partin response to a high extracellular pH . ( $\mathrm{N} 31-13$

In addition to a local respiratory alkalosis, the elimination of perfusion has a second consequence. Downstream from the blockage, alveolar type II pneumocytes become starved for various nutrients, including the lipids they need to make surfactant. (These cells never become starved for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ !) As a result of the decreased blood flow, surfactant production falls over a period of hours to days. The result is a local decrease in compliance, further reducing local ventilation.

These compensatory responses-bronchiolar constriction (i.e., increased resistance, a property of conducting airways) and reduced surfactant production (i.e., decreased compliance, a property of alveoli)-work well only if the alveolar dead space is relatively small, so that an ample volume of healthy tissue remains into which the airflow can divert.

## The perfusion of unventilated alveoli (local $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}=0$ ) triggers a compensatory hypoxic vasoconstriction

Shunt Alveolar dead-space ventilation is at one end of the spectrum of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches. At the opposite end is shunt-the flow of blood past unventilated alveoli. For example, if we ligate a mainstem bronchus, then inspired air cannot refresh alveoli distal to the obstruction (see Fig. 31-12A). As a result, mixed-venous blood perfusing the unventilated alveoli "shunts" from the right heart to the left heart, without benefit of ventilation. When the low- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ shunted blood mixes with high- $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ unshunted blood (which is ventilated), the result is that the mixture has a lower-thannormal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, causing hypoxia in the systemic arteries. It is possible to calculate the extent of the shunt from the degree of hypoxia. (○) N31-14

Natural causes of airway obstruction include aspiration of a foreign body or the presence of a tumor in the lumen of a conducting airway. The collapse of alveoli (atelectasis) also produces a right-to-left shunt, a pathological example of which is pneumothorax (see p. 608). Atelectasis also occurs naturally in dependent regions of the lungs, where $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{IP}}$ is not so negative (see Fig. 31-5C) and surfactant levels gradually decline. Sighing or yawning stimulates surfactant release (see p. 615) and can reverse physiological atelectasis.

Imagine that an infant aspirates a peanut. Initially, the air trapped distal to the obstruction has the composition of normal alveolar air. However, pulmonary-capillary blood gradually extracts $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from the trapped air and adds $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

# N31-13 Bronchiolar Constriction during Alveolar Dead-Space Ventilation 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The precise mechanism of bronchiolar constriction in response to alveolar dead-space ventilation is unknown. However, it is intriguing to speculate that, at least in part, the mechanism may parallel that for the autoregulation of blood flow in the brain. The vascular smooth-muscle cells (VSMCs) of the penetrating cerebral arterioles constrict in response to respiratory alkalosiswhich is why one feels dizzy after hyperventilating. This
constriction of the VSMCs occurs when one imposes an alkalosis in the complete absence of $\mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$. Furthermore, the alkalosis-induced vasoconstriction is due entirely to a pH decrease on the outside of the VSMC. In other words, these cells have some sort of an extracellular pH sensor. A pH increase on the inside of the cell actually has the opposite effect: vasodilation. During extracellular acidosis, the vessels dilate.

## N31-14 The Shunt Equation

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

A shunt is one extreme of a $\dot{\mathrm{V}} / \dot{\mathrm{O}}$ mismatch and arises when blood perfuses unventilated alveoli. Alveoli may be unventilated because they are downstream from an obstructed conducting airway. Regardless of the mechanism that prevents airflow to these alveoli, the resulting right-to-left shunt causes mixedvenous blood to remain relatively unoxygenated and to go directly to the left heart, where it mixes with oxygenated "arterial" blood. This process is known as venous admixture.

Imagine that $80 \%$ of the blood flow to the lungs goes to alveoli that are appropriately ventilated but that $20 \%$ goes to alveoli that are downstream from completely obstructed conducting airways. The total perfusion of the lungs is $\dot{\mathrm{O}}_{T}$. The shunt perfusion of the unventilated alveoli is $\dot{\mathrm{O}}_{0}, 20 \%$ in this example, and the shunted blood has an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content (units: $\mathrm{mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) identical to that of mixed-venous blood ( Cv ). The difference $\left(\dot{\mathrm{O}}_{T}-\dot{\mathrm{O}}_{0}\right)$ is the perfusion to the normally ventilated alveoli, $80 \%$ in our example, and this unshunted blood has an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content appropriate for the end of a pulmonary capillary $\left(\mathrm{Cc}^{\prime}\right)$.

The blood emerging from the lungs is a mixture of shunted and unshunted blood so that the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ emerging from the lung is partially $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carried by the shunted blood and partially $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carried by the unshunted blood:

Total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ leaving lungs $=$ Shunted $\mathrm{O}_{2}+$ Unshunted $\mathrm{O}_{2} \quad$ (NE 31-35)
How much $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ per minute emerges from the lungs in the systemic arterial blood? This amount is the product of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of this arterial blood $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{a}}\right)$ and the total blood flow out the lungs $\left(\dot{\mathrm{O}}_{T}\right)$ :

$$
\text { Total } \mathrm{O}_{2} \text { leaving lungs }=\mathrm{Ca} \times \dot{\mathrm{O}} \mathrm{\gamma}
$$

(NE 31-36)
Similarly, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contributed by the shunted blood is the product of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content and the flow of shunted blood:

Eventually, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the trapped air drift to their values in mixed-venous blood. If the shunt is small, so that it does not materially affect the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the systemic arterial blood, then the alveoli will have a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 46 mm Hg . By definition, shunted alveoli have a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of zero and are represented by the "Mixed-venous blood" point on an $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram (see Fig. 31-10B).

Redirection of Airflow Blocking airflow to one group of alveoli simultaneously diverts air to normal parts of the lung, which then become somewhat hyperventilated. Thus, shunt not only decreases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in unventilated alveoli, but also increases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in other regions. The net effect is a widening of the nonuniformity of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ratios.

Asthma Although less dramatic than complete airway obstruction, an incomplete occlusion also decreases $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$. An example is asthma, in which hyperreactivity of airway smooth muscle increases local airway resistance and decreases ventilation of alveoli distal to the pathology.

Normal Anatomical Shunts The thebesian veins drain some of the venous blood from the heart muscle, particularly the left ventricle, directly into the corresponding cardiac chamber. Thus, delivery of deoxygenated blood from thebesian veins into the left ventricle ( $<1 \%$ of cardiac output) represents a right-to-left shunt. The bronchial arteries, branches of the aorta that carry $\sim 2 \%$ of the cardiac output, supply the conducting airways (see p. 597). After passing through capillaries, about half of the bronchial blood drains into a systemic vein-the azygos vein-and then to the right heart. The other half ( $\sim 1 \%$ of cardiac output) anastomoses with oxygenated blood in pulmonary venules and thus represents part of the anatomical right-to-left shunt (see p. 412).

Pathological Shunts In Chapter 57, we discuss examples of right-to-left shunts. N31-15 Respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn (Box 57-2) can cause airway collapse. Generalized hypoxemia in the newborn can constrict the pulmonary vasculature, as we will see in the next paragraph, leading to pulmonary hypertension and the shunting of blood via the foramen ovale (see p. 1158) or a patent ductus arteriosus (see p. 1158).

Regulation of Local Perfusion The alveoli that derive from a single terminal bronchiole surround the pulmonary arteriole that supplies these alveoli. Thus, the vascular smoothmuscle cells of this pulmonary arteriole are bathed in an interstitial fluid whose composition reflects that of the local alveolar gas. In the case of shunt, the vascular smoothmuscle cells sense a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, an increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and a fall in pH . The decrease in local alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ triggers a compensatory hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (see p. 687), which the accompanying respiratory acidosis augments (see Fig. 31-12B). Note that this response is just the opposite of that of systemic arterioles, which dilate in response to hypoxia (see pp. 477-478). Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction makes teleological sense because it diverts blood flow away from unventilated alveoli toward normal alveoli, to which airflow is also being diverted. This compensation tends to correct the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ shift in both the unventilated and normal alveoli.

If the amount of pulmonary tissue involved is sufficiently small ( $<20 \%$ ), then hypoxic vasoconstriction has a minimal effect on overall pulmonary vascular resistance. The vasoconstriction causes a slight increase in pulmonary arterial pressure, which recruits and distends pulmonary vessels outside of the shunt zone. In contrast, global alveolar hypoxia-caused by, for example, ascending to high altitude-produces a generalized hypoxic vasoconstriction that may cause the resistance of the pulmonary vasculature to more than double. In susceptible individuals, the result can be acute mountain sickness (see p. 1232).

## Even if whole-lung $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ are normal, exaggerated local $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches produce hypoxia and respiratory acidosis

As we saw in Table 31-3, even a normal person has lung regions with $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ values ranging from $\sim 0.6$ to 3.3. In addition, even a normal person has local variations in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ due to alveolar dead-space ventilation as well as physiological and anatomical shunts. These physiological $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches produces an arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (i.e., $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) that we regard as "normal" and an arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (i.e., $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ) that we also regard as "normal." If pathological processes exaggerate this $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch, the result is respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. The sophisticated compensatory responses to alveolar dead-space ventilation and shuntdiscussed above-help to minimizes these mismatches. Thus, uncompensated $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ abnormalities lead to respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. To illustrate how $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches produce these consequences, here we examine $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ handling first in normal lungs and then in two extreme, idealized cases: alveolar dead-space ventilation and shunt-each in the absence of any local or system-wide compensation.

Normal Lungs Figure 31-13 shows how an individual with a normal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ distribution in each lung handles $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. We assume that total $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}(4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}(5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min})$ are normal and divided equally between the two lungs. Each lung eliminates half of the $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by metabolism (see Fig. 31-13A), and each takes up half of the $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ consumed by metabolism (see Fig. 31-13B). The physiological $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ distribution, as discussed in the previous paragraph, yields a mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in each lung and a mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Because the fluxes of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ across the alveolar blood-gas barrier are each perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressures in the systemic arterial blood are the same as in the alveoli, and arterial pH is normal.

Alveolar Dead-Space Ventilation Affecting One Lung To simulate alveolar dead-space ventilation (Fig. 31-14) in the laboratory, we can surgically ligate the left pulmonary artery, thereby eliminating all perfusion to the left lung. Total $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ remains at its normal $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but all blood goes to the right lung. $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ remains at its normal $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ and is evenly distributed between the two lungs. Thus, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to the left

Figure 31-13 Normal distribution of $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{O}}$. (C) N31-18 This is an idealized example. In the upper panels of $\mathbf{A}$ and $\mathbf{B}$, the light beige boxes give the alveolar ventilation to each lung as well as the total alveolar ventilation $\left(\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}\right)$. The pink boxes give the blood flow to each lung as well as the total cardiac output ( $\dot{\mathrm{O}}$ ). The white boxes give the rates of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport (in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$ ) at either the pulmonary or systemic capillaries. The blue boxes give the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressures (in mm Hg ) in alveolar air. The lavender boxes give the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressure (in mm Hg ) and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content (in $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ) in the mixed-venous blood, in the blood leaving each of the lungs, and in the mixed-arterial blood. The dark beige boxes give the same information for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. The lower panel of $\mathbf{A}$ shows hypothetical plots of how total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content varies with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ at the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ saturations typical of arterial blood (red line) and mixed-venous blood (violet line). The vertical arrow indicates the decrease in total $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content between the mixed-venous and arterial blood ( $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). The lower panel of B shows comparable plots for how total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content varies with $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ at the pH and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values typical of mixedvenous blood (violet curve) and arterial blood (red curve). The vertical arrow indicates the increase in total $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content between the mixed-venous and arterial blood ( $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ).

# N31-18 Analysis of $\dot{V} / \dot{\mathrm{O}}$ Patterns in Figure 31-13 

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The following is a discussion of Figure 31-13 that is more complete than the material presented in the subsection "Normal Lungs" (see p. 693).

Figure 31-13 is a highly simplified example illustrating the principles underlying how an individual with a normal $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ in each lung handles $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (Fig. 31-13A) and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (Fig. 31-13B) as blood flows through the lungs, the systemic circulation, and then back to the lungs. We make the following assumptions:

- Total $\dot{V}_{A}\left(4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}\right)$ and $\dot{Q}\left(5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}\right)$ are normal.
- $\dot{V}_{A}$ and $\dot{Q}$ are evenly divided between the two lungs. Thus, the overall $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratio is $\left(4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}\right) /\left(5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}\right)$ or 0.84 . Of course, the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ in each of the two lungs is also 0.84 .
- $\dot{V}_{A}$ and $\dot{Q}$ are uniformly distributed within each lung. In other words, we are ignoring the usual apex-to-base inequalities of both $\dot{V}_{A}$ and $\dot{Q}$ (see Fig. 31-10). In addition, we assume that the lungs are free of pathological causes of either alveolar dead-space ventilation or shunt.
- The system has no physiological right-to-left shunts.
- The $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in each lung will be 40 mm Hg ; and the $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ 100 mm Hg .
- Total-body $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ will be $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ and total-body $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ will be $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.
- The entire system is in a steady state.

Predicting precisely how $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ abnormalities affect the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ partial pressures in the three key compartments (alveoli, arterial blood, and mixed-venous blood) is extremely complicated, in part because changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH affect $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ carriage (the Bohr effect; see p. 652) and changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ affect $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ carriage (the Haldane effect; see p. 657). Moreover, in reality, $\dot{V}_{A}, \dot{Q}$, and the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratio are not uniform throughout each lung. However, although the examples in the text are greatly simplified, they illustrate the principles of how $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ mismatches lead to abnormalities in the arterial blood gases. We begin here with a discussion of the normal condition. We will consider alveolar dead-space ventilation in (5) N31-19 and shunt in (5) N31-20.

We will now follow the blood during one circuit through the circulation to see the relationship among the composition of the arterial blood, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport rates in the lung, and the composition of the mixed-venous blood.

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Handling

First consider the fate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the following six steps (see Fig. 31-13A):
Step 1: Each lung must first receive and then exhale half of the total $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that body metabolism produces. In other words, 100 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters each lung each minute, and because they are in a steady state, each lung exhales precisely this same amount each minute.
Step 2: In each lung, a $\dot{V}_{A}$ of $2.1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ dilutes 100 mL of exhaled $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (i.e., the exhaled 100 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is contained within the 2100 mL of exhaled air). This combination of $\dot{V}_{A}$ and $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ corresponds to a $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of -40 mm Hg .
Step 3: Because $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ transport is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the blood that emerges from each lung has the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ as the alveolar air, 40 mm Hg . According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that this $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg corresponds to an arterial $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-13A, point a).
Step 4: As the blood flows through the systemic capillaries, it picks up the $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ produced by metabolism. Given a cardiac output of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, we can use the Fick
principle (see p. 423) to compute how much the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content must rise in the capillaries for each 100 mL of blood:
$\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{O}}}=\frac{200 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=40 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=4 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$
(NE 31-42)
Thus, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content must be $48+4=$ $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$.
Step 5: According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, when the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood is $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ must be 46 mm Hg (lower panel of Fig. 31-13A, point $\vec{v}$ ).
Step 6: As the blood completes the cycle and passes through the pulmonary capillaries, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls from 46 mm Hg to its original value of 40 mm Hg as 100 mL of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diffuses from the pulmonary capillaries to the alveoli each minute in each lung. Simultaneously, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content falls from 52 to $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ evolves into the alveolar air at the rate of $100 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ in each lung ( $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$, total).

## $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Handling

Now consider the fate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, illustrated in six steps in Figure 31-13B. The situation for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is comparable to that for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, although the fluxes are all in a direction opposite to those for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
Step 1: Each lung must take up half of the $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ required by body metabolism, that is, $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ for each lung.
Step 2: For a $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg and an RQ (see Equation 31-14) of 0.8 , the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17) predicts a $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of -100 mm Hg for each lung.
Step 3: The transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, like that of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), so that the blood emerging from each lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of -100 mm Hg . According to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 100 mm Hg corresponds to an arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-13B, point a).
Step 4: As the blood flows through the systemic capillaries, it must give up $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, which will be consumed by metabolism. According to the Fick principle, the decrease in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content that occurs as the blood passes through the systemic capillaries is

$$
\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=50 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=5 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}
$$

(NE 31-43)
Thus, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content must be $20-5=$ $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$.
Step 5: From the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that a mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ corresponds to a mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ of 40 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-13B, point $\vec{v}$ ).
Step 6: As the blood completes the cycle and passes through the lungs, it must pick up $125 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ in each lung. This influx of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ causes the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content to increase from 15 to $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, as the blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ increases from 40 to 100 mm Hg .

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The following is a discussion of Figure 31-14 that is more complete than the material presented in the subsection "Alveolar DeadSpace Ventilation Affecting One Lung" (see pp. 693-696).

Figure 31-14 is a highly simplified example that illustrates the principles underlying how alveolar dead-space ventilation affects the handling of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Except as noted below in this paragraph, all assumptions and parameter values for this example are the same as for the normal case in Figure 31-13. 0 N3118 The key difference in the example in Figure 31-14 is that the left lung receives no perfusion-alveolar dead-space ventilation. The total $\dot{Q}$ remains at $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but all of this perfusion goes to the right lung. Notice that the $\dot{V}_{A}$ of $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ is evenly distributed between the two lungs. Thus, the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ of the left lung is $2.1 / 0$ or $\infty$, whereas the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ of the right lung is $2.1 / 5$ or 0.42 . The overall $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ remains 0.84 . Can the low $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ of the normal lung make up for the high $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ of the abnormal lung?

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Handling

First consider the fate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the following seven steps (see Fig. 31-14):
Step 1: In the steady state, the normal right lung must eliminate the entire complement of metabolically produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production, which is $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ delivery to the right lung is twice its normal level.
Step 2: In the right lung, the normal $\dot{V}_{A}$ of $2.1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ must now dilute twice the normal amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Thus, alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in this right lung must be twice normal (i.e., $\sim 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ).
Step 3: Because no blood is flowing to the left lung, its alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the same as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of inspired air (i.e., $\sim 0 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ). Half of the alveolar air that the subject expires comes from the right lung, and half comes from the left lung. Thus, the mean $\mathbf{P A}_{\mathbf{CO}_{2}}$ is $(80+0) / 2=40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which is normal! As we will see below, this mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is important for computing the alveolar-arterial (A-a) difference (see Box 31-1).
Step 4: Because the transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across the blood-gas barrier is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the blood leaving the right lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ that is the same as the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the right lung, 80 mm Hg . Because no blood exits from the left lung, the systemic arterial blood also has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 80 mm Hg . According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 80 mm Hg (which represents a substantial degree of respiratory acidosis) corresponds to a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of $\sim 67 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-14A, point al.
Step 5: In the systemic capillaries, metabolically produced $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ enters the blood at the rate of $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. As we already know from our analysis of the normal condition in Figure 31-13A, adding $200 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to 5 liters of blood increases the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content by $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ :

$$
\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{200 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=40 \mathrm{~mLCO}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=4 \mathrm{~mLCO}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}
$$

$(\mathrm{NE} 31-44)$
Thus, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood at the end of the systemic capillaries will be $67+4=71 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$.
Step 6: According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, when the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood is $71 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ must be 87 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-14A, point $\vec{v}$ ).
Step 7: As the blood completes the cycle and passes through the pulmonary capillaries of the right lung, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls from 87 mm Hg back to its original value of 80 mm Hg . Simultaneously, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content falls from $71 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ to its original value of $67 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ as $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ evolves into the alveolar air at the rate of $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.

Thus, even with a severe $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ abnormality, the lung is able to expel the usual $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but at a tremendous price: a very high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and thus respiratory acidosis (see p. 633).

## $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Handling

Now consider the fate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ (see Fig. 31-14B):
Step 1: The normal right lung must deliver all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ required by the body, $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ abstraction from the right lung is twice normal.
Step 2: Because the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratio of the normal right lung is so low (i.e., half normal), the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the right lung must be far lower than the usual value of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Because the $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in this lung is 80 mm Hg and $\mathrm{RQ}_{\mathrm{I}}$ is 0.8 , we use the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17) to compute a $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 51 mm Hg .
Step 3: Because no blood flow goes to the left lung, its $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ is $\infty$, and thus its alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the same as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of inspired air (i.e., 149 mm Hg ). The mean $\mathbf{P A}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}$ of air expired from the two lungs is $(51+149) / 2=100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ and thus is normal-just as the mean $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ was normal.
Step 4: Because the transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ across the blood-gas barrier is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the blood leaving the right lung is the same as the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the right lung, 51 mm Hg . Because no blood exits from the left lung, the systemic arterial blood has the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ as the blood leaving the right lung, namely 51 mm Hg . From the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 51 mm Hg dictates an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of only $14 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-14B, point al.
Step 5: In the systemic capillaries, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ leaves the blood at the rate of $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. As we already know from our analysis of Figure 31-13B, removing 250 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from 5 L of blood decreases the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content by $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ :

$$
\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=50 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=5 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}
$$

$(\mathrm{NE} 31-45)$
Thus, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood at the end of the systemic capillaries will be $14-5=9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$.
Step 6: According to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, when the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is $9 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ must be 37 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-14B, point $\vec{v}$ ).
Step 7: As the blood completes the cycle and passes through the pulmonary capillaries of the right lung, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ rises from 37 to 51 mm Hg , and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content rise from 9 to $14 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ enters from the alveolar air at the rate of $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.
Thus, even with a severe $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ abnormality, the lung is able to import the usual $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, but at a tremendous price: a very low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (hypoxia).

Beware that this analysis, as complicated as it may seem, is highly oversimplified. For example, in step 4 and step 6 of the

# N31-19 Analysis of $\dot{V} / \dot{Q}$ Patterns in Figure 31-14-cont'd 

$\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ analysis, we used a standard $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve. However, we know that hypoxia will increase the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-carrying capacity of blood (Haldane effect; see p. 657). Similarly, in step 4 and step 6 of the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ analysis, we used a standard $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve. However, we know that respiratory acidosis will decrease the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-carrying capacity of blood (the Bohr effect; see p. 652). Nevertheless, the take-home message is clear. Even if
overall $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ are normal, an uneven distribution of perfusion leads to respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. Thus, the hyperperfused "good" lung cannot make up for the deficit incurred by the hypoperfused "bad" lung. In our example, the fundamental problem is that ventilating unperfused alveoli in the left lung reduces the effective alveolar ventilation by half.

## N31-20 Analysis of V/Q Patterns in Figure 31-15

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The following is a discussion of Figure 31-15 that is more complete than the material presented in the subsection "Shunt Affecting One Lung" (see pp. 696-698).

Figure 31-15 is a highly simplified example that illustrates the principles underlying how a shunt affects the handling of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Except as noted below in this paragraph, all assumptions and parameter values for this example are the same as for the normal case in Figure 31-13. N31-18 The key difference in the example in Figure 31-15 is that the left lung receives no ventilation-shunt. The total $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ remains $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but all of this ventilation goes to the right lung. Notice that the $\dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of $5 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$ is evenly distributed between the two lungs. Thus, the $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of the left lung is $0 / 2.5$ or 0 , whereas the $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of the right lung is $4.2 / 2.5$ or 1.68. Can the high $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of the hyperventilated right lung make up for the low $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of the unventilated left lung?

## $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ Handling

First, we will consider the fate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the following nine steps (see Fig. 31-15A):
Step 1: In the steady state, the normal right lung must eliminate the entire metabolic production of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ delivery to the right lung is twice normal.
Step 2: The twice-normal amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ is diluted into a twice-normal $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}}$ of $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, so that the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ in this right lung must be normal (i.e., 40 mm Hg ).
Step 3: Because no air flow goes to the left lung, the air distal to the obstruction in the left lung will have the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and the same $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ as mixed-venous blood. However, because this air is not in direct communication with atmosphere, it does not contribute to the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the expired air. Thus, the mean $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is simply the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of the alveolar air in the right lung, 40 mm Hg , which is normal!
Step 4: Because the transport of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across the blood-gas barrier is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the blood leaving the right lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ that is the same as the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ on the right, 40 mm Hg . According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, when the blood has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 40 mm Hg , it must have a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point $c$ ). This is the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content after the right lung has extracted $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at the rate of $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.
Step 5: What was the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the blood before the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was extracted? That is, what was the mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ ? According to the Fick principle, the change in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content
as the blood passes through the right lung is simply the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ extraction divided by the blood flow:
$\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{200 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{2.5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=80 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=8 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{CO}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$
(NE 31-46)
Normally (see Fig. 31-13A), the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of the pulmonary-capillary blood would fall by only $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ as it equilibrated with the alveolar air. However, because the rate of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ extraction is twice normal, the decrease in $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content is also twice normal. Thus, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content must be $48+8=56 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. From the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that this $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content corresponds to a mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 51 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point $\vec{v}$ ). Notice that the alveolar air in the obstructed left lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 51 mm Hg , the same as that of the mixed-venous blood.
Step 6: What happens when the blood from the hyperventilated right lung mixes with the shunted blood from the unventilated left lung? Although one might be tempted to average the two $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values (i.e., 40 and 51 mm Hg ), this is a mistaken instinct. Instead, one must average the two $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contents. As we noted above, the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of blood emerging from the right lung is $48 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. The $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of blood emerging from the left lung is the same as for the mixed-venous blood we examined in the previous step, $56 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thus, the mixed arterial $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content is $(48+56) / 2=52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point a).
Step 7: According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ corresponds to an arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 46 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point a).
Step 8: In the systemic capillaries, adding $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to 5 L of blood increases the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content by $4 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, raising the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content from $52 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point a) to $56 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point $\vec{v}$ ). Notice that $56 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ is the mixed-venous value we arrived at above in step 5.
Step 9: According to the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve, a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content of $56 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ corresponds to a mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of 51 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15A, point $\vec{v}$ ). This is the same value that we arrived at above in step 5.
Thus, even with the severe $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ abnormality represented by shunt, the lung is once again able to expel the usual $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but once again at a price: a high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (respiratory

# N31-20 Analysis of $\dot{V} / \dot{\mathrm{O}}$ Patterns in Figure 31-15-cont'd 

acidosis). Because there is a $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ mismatch in this example, we expect there to be an alveolar-arterial (A-a) difference for $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{O}_{2},} \boldsymbol{\nabla}$ N31-17 Because the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is 40 mm Hg , and the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is 46 mm Hg in our example, the A-a difference is $40-46$ or -6 mm Hg .

## $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ Handling

The changes in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ handling are more extreme (see Fig. 31-15B). Step 1: The normal right lung must deliver all the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ required by the body, $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$. This rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ abstraction from the right lung is twice normal.
Step 2: Because the $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratio of the normal right lung is twice normal, and the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction rate is twice normal, we would expect the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the right lung to be the normal value of -100 mm Hg. Put differently, because the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (i.e., 149 mm Hg ), the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the right lung (i.e., 40 mm Hg ), and the RQ (i.e., 0.8 ) are all normal, the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17) yields a normal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ for the right lung, -100 mm Hg .
Step 3: Of course, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the unventilated left lung $\left(\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}=0\right.$ ) is the same as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood. However, because this air is not in direct communication with atmosphere, it does not contribute to the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the expired air. Thus, the mean $\mathbf{P A}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}$ is simply the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the alveolar air in the right lung, -100 mm Hg , which is normal!
Step 4: Because the transport of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ across the blood-gas barrier is perfusion limited (see pp. 671-673), the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the blood leaving the right lung is the same as the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the right lung, -100 mm Hg . Thus, according to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of this blood must be $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point $d$ ). This value is the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content after the right lung has added $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at the rate of $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$.
Step 5: What was the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the mixed-venous blood? According to the Fick principle, the increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content as the blood passes through the right lung is simply the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction divided by the blood flow. Normally (see Fig. 31-15B), the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content would rise by only $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ as the blood equilibrated with the alveolar air. However, because the rate of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ extraction from the lung is twice normal, the increase in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is also twice normal:
$\Delta \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=\frac{\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}}{\dot{\mathrm{Q}}}=\frac{250 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{min}}{2.5 \mathrm{~L} \text { blood } / \mathrm{min}}=100 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{L}=10 \mathrm{~mL} \mathrm{O}_{2} / \mathrm{dL}$
(NE 31-47)
Thus, the mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content must be $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ less than the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the end-capillary blood (i.e., $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ ). The mixed-venous $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is thus $20-10=$ $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. From the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that this $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content corresponds to a mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 29 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point $\vec{v}$ ). The alveolar air in the obstructed left lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 29 mm Hg , the same as that of the mixed-venous blood.

Step 6: What happens when the blood from the hyperventilated right lung mixes with the shunted blood from the unventilated left lung? One must average the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contents of the blood emerging from the right and left lungs. As we noted above, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of blood emerging from the right lung is $20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. The $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of blood emerging from the left lung is the same as for the mixed-venous blood we examined in the previous step, $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thus, the mixed arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is $(20+$ $10) / 2=15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point a).
Step 7: From the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, we see that a mixed-arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ corresponds to a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of -40 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point a).
Step 8: In the systemic capillaries, the tissues extract 250 $\mathrm{mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Removing 250 mL of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ from 5 L of blood decreases the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content by $5 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. Thus, the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood at the end of the systemic capillaries will be $15-5=10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. This is the same value we arrived at in step 5 (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point $\vec{v}$ ).
Step 9: According to the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$ corresponds to a mixed-venous $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 29 mm Hg (see lower panel of Fig. 31-15B, point $\vec{v}$ ). This is the same figure we arrived at in step 5.
Thus, even with the severe $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ abnormality represented by shunt, the lung is able to import the usual $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, but at a price: an extremely low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (hypoxia).

The A-a difference for $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}$ in this example is $100-40=$ 60 mm Hg , which indicates a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch of considerable magnitude. In this extreme example, we entirely eliminated airflow to one lung. Less extreme instances of uneven distribution of airflow will lead to less severe degrees of respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.

Again, beware that this example, like the ones in Figure 31-13 and Figure 31-14, is highly oversimplified. Nevertheless, it is clear that even if overall $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ is normal, and even if the distribution of perfusion is normal, an uneven distribution of ventilation leads to respiratory acidosis and hypoxia. Thus, the overventilated "good" lung cannot make up for the deficit incurred by the underventilated "bad" lung. One fundamental problem is that blood with a normal gas composition from the hyperventilated good lung mixes with shunted blood with a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. The consequences are perhaps easiest to grasp for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport. The blood leaving the normal right lung has a normal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. The shunted blood leaving the unventilated left lung has a very low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content, which is the same as that of mixed-venous blood. Thus, the mixed-arterial blood must have a low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content and must be hypoxic.

A second fundamental problem is that-because of the shape of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve-hyperventilating a good lung cannot proportionally increase the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of the blood leaving that lung. What would happen if the subject were to hyperventilate? Not much. It is true that increasing alveolar ventilation might increase the right alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ above its starting value of 100 mm Hg . However, because the Hb is already $97.5 \%$ saturated with $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ at a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 100 mm Hg , the added ventilation would do little good. The subject would remain hypoxic.

#### Abstract

lung is $2.1 / 0$ or $\infty$, whereas the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to the right lung is $2.1 / 5$ or 0.42 . The overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is normal, 0.84 . The key question is whether a combination of a high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in the abnormal lung and a low $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in the normal lung can yield normal blood-gas levels.

The normal right lung must now eliminate all of the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ that the body produces-that is, the right lung must eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at twice the rate that it normally does. However, the right lung has its usual $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ of $2.1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$. Because a normal amount of alveolar air must carry away twice as much $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in the new steady state, the right lung's alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ doubles to $\sim 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (see Fig. 31-14A). Because the entire cardiac output perfuses the normal right lung, arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is also $\sim 80 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, even with the severe $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ abnormality produced by alveolar dead-space ventilation, the lung is able to expel the usual $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but at a tremendous price: a very high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and thus respiratory acidosis.

The normal right lung must also supply all of the body's $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-delivering $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the blood at twice its normal rate. However, because the right lung still has its normal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ of $2.1 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, its alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls to $\sim 51 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in the new steady state. The blood leaving the right lung, which is identical to systemic arterial blood, also has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 51 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, even with a severe $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ abnormality, the lung is able to import the usual $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, but at a tremendous price: a very low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (hypoxia).

We can now answer the question that we posed above. The hyperperfused "good" lung cannot make up for the deficit incurred by the hypoperfused "bad" lung. In our example, the fundamental problem was that the ventilation of unperfused alveoli in the left lung effectively reduced the alveolar ventilation by half. In real life, the body would have compensated both locally and systemically. Locally, bronchiolar constriction and decreased surfactant production in the abnormal left lung (see Fig. 31-11B) would diminish alveolar dead-space ventilation and increase the effective alveolar ventilation to the normal right lung. Systemically, as we discuss in the next chapter, the respiratory acidosis and hypoxia would stimulate chemoreceptors to increase ventilation. If the body could double $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ to the right lungand if this right lung has a normal diffusing capacity-then it would be matching the doubled perfusion of the right lung with a doubled ventilation, and all resting blood-gas parameters would return to normal. (T) N31-16


A massive pulmonary embolism that obstructs the left pulmonary artery is superficially similar to the example that we have just discussed. However, other associated problems (e.g., right heart failure secondary to an increase in pulmonary vascular resistance, release of vasoactive agents) make the pulmonary embolism potentially fatal.

Shunt Affecting One Lung Imagine that an object occludes the left mainstem bronchus, eliminating all ventilation to the left lung. Total $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ remains at $4.2 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{min}$, but all ventilation goes to the right lung. Thus, the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to the left lung is $0 / 2.5$ or 0 , whereas the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ to the right lung is $4.2 / 2.5$ or 1.68. The overall $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ is normal, 0.84 . Again, the key question is whether a combination of a low $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in the abnormal lung and a high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ in the normal lung can yield normal blood-gas levels.

The normal right lung must now eliminate $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ at twice its normal rate. However, the right lung also has twice its normal $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$. Because twice the normal amount of alveolar air carries away twice the normal amount of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the right lung's new steady-state alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is normal, $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (Fig. 31-15A). The blood leaving the normal lung also has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. However, the unventilated lung has the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood, $\sim 51 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in this example. After the two streams of blood min-known as venous admixture, because venous blood combines with blood from ventilated alveoli-arterial blood in the left ventricle has a $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ content that is midway between the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ contents of the two streams of blood, corresponding to an arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 46 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, even with the severe $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ abnormality produced by shunt, the lung is once again able to expel the usual $200 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, but once again at a price: a high arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (respiratory acidosis).

The normal right lung must also deliver $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to the blood at twice the normal rate. However, because the right lung's $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ is also twice its usual value, its new steady-state alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is normal, $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. The blood leaving the right lung also has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, a hemoglobin $(\mathrm{Hb})$ saturation $\left(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of $\sim 97.5 \%$, and an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $\sim 20 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. However, the unventilated lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of mixed-venous blood, $\sim 29 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in this example. Thus, the blood leaving the shunted lung has an $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 49 \%$ and an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of $\sim 10 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$. After venous admixture, arterial $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content is $(20+10) / 2$ or $15 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{dL}$, which corresponds to an arterial

# N31-16 Surgical Removal of One Lung 

## Contributed by Walter Boron

As we saw in Figure 30-10, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ reaches diffusion equilibrium about one third of the way down the pulmonary capillary of a healthy young adult at rest. If one of the two lungs were removed surgically, the remaining lung would receive twice its normal complement of blood flow. However, provided that alveolar ventilation, $\mathrm{Fi}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{~Pa}$, and $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ were normal, diffusion equilibrium for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ would still occur before the end of the pulmonary capillary. If the ventilation-perfusion relationship were also normal for this subject, then arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would be normal-at least at rest. However, during exercise, $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ transport could well become diffusion limited. Moreover, if $\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{L}}$ were substantially below normal, or if $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \overline{\mathrm{Q}}$ relationships were problematic, then the subject could exhibit arterial hypoxemia even at rest. Therefore, in patients considered for total pneumonectomy, it is critical to evaluate pulmonary function preoperatively to confirm that the patient would be able to survive postoperatively with the remaining lung.

# BOX 31-1 Clinical Approaches for Diagnosing a $\dot{V}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ Mismatch 

Rither simple diagnostic methods are available for detecting the presence of a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch, assessing its severity, and identifying a shunt.

## Diagnosis of Exclusion

The physician can often diagnose a pathological nonuniformity of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ by excluding other possibilities. In general, low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ -under basal metabolic conditions-could be due to a reduced inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (e.g., high altitude), reduced alveolar ventilation, decreased diffusing capacity $\left(D_{L}\right)$, or $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch. Let us assume that arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is appropriate for the altitude (see p. 681) and that results of simple spirometric tests indicate that respiratory mechanics are normal. Because $D_{L}$ is normally about 3 -fold greater than necessary for achieving diffusion equilibrium for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ (see pp. 671-672), a problem with $\mathrm{D}_{L}$ is unlikely in the absence of a positive history. By default, the most likely cause is a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ defect.

## Alveolar-Arterial Gradient for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$

The difference between the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and the systemic arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is known as the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient for $\mathbf{P}_{\mathbf{O}_{2}}$. In our "normal" example in Figure 31-13B, both mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ were 100 mm Hg . In real life, however, physiological $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches cause arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to be 5 to 15 mm Hg below the mean alveolar value.

A defining characteristic of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches is that they widen the A-a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ gradient. In our example of alveolar dead space in Figure 31-14B, the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ was $(51+149) / 2=$ 100 mm Hg , whereas the systemic arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ was 51 mm Hg , for an A-a gradient of 49 mm Hg . In our example of shunt in Figure 31-15B, the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ was $100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, whereas the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ was only 40 mm Hg -an A-a gradient of 60 mm Hg .

Because the A-a gradient for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is an index of the severity of the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch, physicians routinely estimate the A-a gradient in the intensive care unit. The approach is to (1) obtain the arterial blood-gas levels, which include $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{NO}_{2}}$, (2) assume that the mean $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is the same as the measured $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, (3) use the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17) to compute the mean $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ from mean $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$; and (4) compute the difference $\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ $-\mathrm{PA}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. However, the assumption in point 2 is not entirely true because $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches cause an A-a gradient for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ just as they do for $\mathrm{O}_{2} . \quad \text { 1 N31-17 }$

## Effect of Breathing $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$

Once a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch has been identified, it is important to distinguish between a shunt, which might be corrected surgically, and other causes. Imagine two patients with similar degrees of hypoxia. In the first patient, one lung is relatively hypoventilated (low $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ) and the other lung is relatively hyperventilated (high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ ). However, no alveoli are shunted. In the second patient, a complete shunting of blood makes one lung totally unventilated (a $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ of zero, as in Figure 31-15). The normal lung has a high $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$. We can distinguish between the two cases by having both subjects inspire $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$.

When the patient without predominant shunt breathes $100 \%$ $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of the blood leaving both lungs will be far higher than normal (Fig. 31-16A). Blood leaving the hypoventilated lung has a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ somewhat lower than that of the blood leaving the hyperventilated lung. However, because the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is on the flat part of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve in both cases, the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values are virtually identical. The miniscule difference in $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ contents between the two streams of blood is due to a difference in dissolved $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Thus, the mixed systemic arterial blood will have a slightly elevated $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content, an $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ of $\sim 100 \%$, and a markedly elevated $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.

The situation is very different in the patient with a severe shunt (see Fig. 31-16B). Because blood leaving the shunted lung does not equilibrate with the alveoli ventilated with $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, it has the low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{~S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content characteristic of mixed-venous blood. Although blood leaving the normal lung will have an extremely high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, both the $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content will be only slightly above normal-like the hyperventilated lung in Figure 31-16A. Thus, when one stream of blood with a slightly increased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content ("normal" lung) mixes with another stream with a markedly decreased $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content ("shunted" lung), the mixed-systemic arterial blood has a lower-thannormal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content. This low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content translates to a low $\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and thus to a low systemic arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Thus, unlike subjects with other kinds of $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatches that do not include substantial shunt (e.g., alveolar dead-space ventilation in Fig. 31-14), those with substantial shunt have low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values, even while breathing $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$. Because breathing $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$ greatly increases mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ without substantially increasing arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, this maneuver greatly exaggerates the A-a difference for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.
$\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\left(\mathrm{Sa}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}\right)$ of 73 and a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$. Thus, even with the severe $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ abnormality caused by shunt, the lung is able to import the usual $250 \mathrm{~mL} / \mathrm{min}$ of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$, but at the price of an extremely low arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ (hypoxia).

Why did the $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}} / \dot{\mathrm{Q}}$ mismatch caused by shunt lead to only a mild respiratory acidosis but a severe hypoxia? The fundamental problem is that the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve (see Fig. 29-3) is nearly saturated at the normal arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. If $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content were proportional to $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, then mixing unshunted blood $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$ with shunted blood $\left(\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}=29 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}\right)$ would have yielded arterial blood with a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $(100+29) / 2=\sim 65 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$, which is far higher than the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ in our example.

In our example, shunt would trigger compensation at two levels. Locally, hypoxic vasoconstriction would divert blood to well-ventilated alveoli. Systemically, an increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ would lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and raise $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ in the normal right lung. In fact, even a modest increase in $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ would be sufficient to lower arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to 40 mm Hg . However, even if $\dot{\mathrm{V}}_{\mathrm{A}}$ approached infinity (raising the right lung's alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to the inspired $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of $\sim 149 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ ), arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would still be well under 100 mm Hg . In fact, even if the inspired air were $100 \% \mathrm{O}_{2}$, the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ would still fail to reach 100 mm Hg ; because of the shape of the $\mathrm{Hb}-\mathrm{O}_{2}$ dissociation curve, an increased alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ can increase the $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ content of arterial blood only marginally (Box 31-1).

$\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{x}} / \mathrm{Q}$ mismatches lead not only to an alveolar-arterial (A-a) difference in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, but also to an A-a difference in the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ partial pressure (Robin test). In our example of alveolar dead space (see Fig. 31-14A), the A-a difference for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was $40-80$ or -40 mm Hg , and in our example of shunt (see Fig. 31-15A), it was $40-46$ or -6 mm Hg . A-a differences for $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ are smaller than those for $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ both because alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values are lower and because the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ dissociation curve is more linear. Clinicians generally do not use the $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} \mathrm{~A}$-a difference as an index of a $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{x}} / \mathrm{Q}$ mismatch. In fact, they generally assume that the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is identical to the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and they use this value in the alveolar gas equation (see Equation 31-17) for computing the mean alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ needed to determine the A-a difference for $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$.

Mixed $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ Mismatches Pathological $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ mismatches cause the range of $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratios to broaden beyond the physiological range. Some alveoli may be true alveolar dead space (i.e., perfusion absent, $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}=\infty$ ), but others may be more modestly underperfused. Some alveoli may be totally shunted (i.e., ventilation absent, $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}=0$ ), but others may be more modestly underventilated. Thus, the left ventricle receives a mixture of blood from alveoli with $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratios from $\infty$ to zero, corresponding to all of the points along the $\mathrm{O}_{2}-\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ diagram in Figure 31-10B. What is the composition of this mixed blood? The principles that we developed in our simplified examples of alveolar dead-space ventilation and shunt still hold. Even if total $\dot{V}_{A}$ and total $\dot{Q}$ remain normal, pathologically high $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ ratios in some alveoli cannot make up for pathologically low ratios in others, and vice versa. The result of uncompensated pathological $\dot{V}_{A} / \dot{Q}$ mismatching is always respiratory acidosis and hypoxia.

# CONTROL OF VENTILATION 

George B. Richerson and Walter F. Boron

## OVERVIEW OF THE RESPIRATORY CONTROL SYSTEM

Breathing is one of those things in life that you almost never think about until something goes wrong with it. However, those with pulmonary disease become intensely aware of breathing, as do people who overexert themselves, especially at high altitude. The feeling of dyspnea that they experience (see p. 701) is one of the most unpleasant sensations in life (Box 32-1). Swimmers and SCUBA divers, musicians who sing or play wind instruments, Lamaze practitioners, and anyone with a bed partner who snores also focus intensely on breathing. It is common for respiratory output to be the last brain function to be lost in comatose patients, in which case its cessation marks the onset of brain death. ( $\mathbf{\text { N32-1 }}$ Thus, despite our common tendency to ignore breathing, control of ventilation is one of the most important of all brain functions.

The ventilatory control mechanism must accomplish two tasks. First, it must establish the automatic rhythm for contraction of respiratory muscles. Second, it must adjust this rhythm to accommodate changing metabolic demands (as reflected by changes in blood $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH ), varying mechanical conditions (e.g., changing posture), and a range of episodic nonventilatory behaviors (e.g., speaking, sniffing, eating).

## Automatic centers in the brainstem activate the respiratory muscles rhythmically and subconsciously

The rhythmic output of the central nervous system (CNS) to muscles of ventilation normally occurs automatically, without any conscious effort. This output depends upon a vast array of interconnected neurons-located primarily in the medulla oblongata, but also in the pons and other brainstem regions. These neurons are called respiratory-related neurons (RRNs) because they fire more action potentials during specific parts of the respiratory cycle. For example, some neurons have peak activity during inspiration, and others, during expiration. Some RRNs are interneurons (i.e., they make local connections), others are premotor neurons (i.e., they innervate motor neurons), and still others are motor neurons (i.e., they innervate muscles of respiration). A subset of these neurons, thought to be in the medulla oblongata, is able to independently generate a respiratory
rhythm-and is known as the central pattern generator (CPG; see p. 396). Together the neurons of the respiratory network distribute signals appropriately to various pools of cranial and spinal motor neurons (see pp. 241-242), which directly innervate the respiratory muscles (Fig. 32-1).

The most important respiratory motor neurons are those that send axons via the phrenic nerve to innervate the diaphragm (Table 32-1), one of the primary muscles of inspiration (see p. 607). When respiratory output increases (e.g., during exercise), activity also appears in motor neurons that innervate a wide variety of accessory muscles of inspiration and expiration (see p. 607).

Each of these muscles is active at different times within the respiratory cycle, and the brain can alter this timing depending on prevailing conditions. It is the job of the premotor neurons to orchestrate the appropriate patterns of activity among the different pools of motor neurons. The pattern of alternating inspiratory and expiratory activity that occurs under normal conditions during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, at rest, and during mild exercise is called eupnea. During eupnea, neural output to respiratory muscles is highly regular, with rhythmic bursts of activity during inspiration only to the diaphragm and certain intercostal muscles. Expiration occurs purely as a result of cessation of inspiration and passive elastic recoil (see p. 606) of the chest wall and lungs. During more intense exercise, the amplitude and frequency of phrenic nerve activity increase, and additional activity appears in nerves that supply accessory muscles of inspiration. With this increased effort, the accessory muscles of expiration also become active (see p. 608), thereby producing more rapid exhalation and permitting the next inspiration to begin sooner (i.e., increasing respiratory frequency).

## Peripheral and central chemoreceptors-which sense $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH -drive the CPG

The CPG for breathing is the clock that times the automatic cycling of inspiration and expiration. In some cases, the CPG stops "ticking" in the absence of tonic drive inputs, which results in the absence of ventilation, or apnea. Although this tonic drive comes from many sources, the most important are the central and peripheral chemoreceptors, which monitor the arterial blood gas parameters- $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and pH levels. Unlike the frequency of a clock, that of the

# N32-1 Brain Death 

## Contributed by George Richerson

As stated in the text, respiratory output is often the last brain function to be lost in comatose patients, in which case its cessation marks the onset of brain death. In the United States, the legal definition of "brain death" is the irreversible loss of clinical function of the entire brain-which does not include the spinal cord. Brain death is legally equivalent to other forms of death. The declaration of brain death requires a careful neurological examination testing all reflexes mediated by cranial nerves, evaluating the patient for evidence of behaviors that require brain function, and ruling out any reversible cause such as hypothermia or drug overdose.

respiratory CPG changes with the strength of the drive from the chemoreceptors, resulting in changes in both depth and frequency of ventilation.

The peripheral chemoreceptors, located in the carotid bodies in the neck and aortic bodies in the thorax, are primarily sensitive to decreases in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, although high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and low pH also stimulate them and enhance their sensitivity to hypoxia. They convey their sensory information to the medulla via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve [CN] IX) and vagus nerve (CN X). The central chemoreceptors, located on the brain side of the blood-brain barrier (see pp. 284-287), sense increases in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and-much more slowly-decreases in arterial pH , but not arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. All three signals trigger an increase in alveolar ventilation that tends to return these arterial blood-gas parameters to normal. Thus, the chemoreceptors, in addition to supplying tonic drive to the CPG, form the critical sensory end of a negative-feedback system that uses respiratory output to stabilize arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH (see Fig. 32-1).

## BOX 32-1 Dyspnea

Dyspnea is the feeling of being short of breath, or the unpleasant conscious awareness of difficulty in breathing. In some cases, dyspnea is an adaptive response. For example, when arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls or $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ rises from breath holding, asphyxia, or pulmonary disease, dyspnea leads to efforts to increase ventilation and thus to restore arterial blood gas levels to normal. However, dyspnea can occur even with a normal arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. For example, increased airway resistance can cause dyspnea, even if arterial blood gas levels do not change. Exercise also causes dyspnea, even though $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is usually normal and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls. Other causes of dyspnea seem maladaptive. For example, claustrophobia and panic attacks can induce the feeling of suffocation-that is, dyspnea-despite normal ventilatory parameters or even a drop in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. The central neural mechanisms and pathways responsible for dyspnea are unknown, although many of the forebrain regions involved have been identified.

## Other receptors as well as higher brain centers also modulate ventilation

Left alone, the respiratory CPG would tick regularly for an indefinite period. However, many inputs to the CPG cause the clock to speed up or slow down. For example, respiratory output is often highly irregular during many behaviors that use the respiratory muscles (e.g., eating, talking, and yawning). During NREM sleep or quiet wakefulness, and with anesthesia, the CPG is unperturbed and does run regularly; it is under these conditions that neuroscientists usually study mechanisms of respiratory control.

A variety of receptors in the lungs and airways provide sensory feedback that the medulla integrates and uses to alter respiratory output. Stretch receptors monitor pulmonary mechanics (e.g., lung volume, muscle length) and may help optimize breathing parameters during changes in posture or activity. Activation of pulmonary stretch receptors also can terminate inspiratory efforts, thereby preventing overinflation. Other sensors that detect the presence of foreign bodies or chemicals in the airways are important for protecting the lungs by triggering a cough or a sneeze. Still others detect the movement of joints, which may be important for raising ventilation with exercise. The mechanoreceptors and chemoreceptors in the lungs and lower (i.e., distal) airways send their sensory information to the respiratory neurons of the medulla via CN X , and those in the upper airways send information via CN IX.

Nonrespiratory brainstem nuclei and higher centers in the CNS also interact with respiratory control centers, which allows the ventilatory system to accommodate such activities as speaking, playing a musical instrument, swallowing, and vomiting. These interconnections also allow respiratory control to be highly integrated with the autonomic nervous system, the sleep-wake cycle, emotions, and other aspects of brain function.

In the remainder of this chapter, we examine (1) respiratory neurons, (2) how these neurons generate the automatic rhythm of ventilation, (3) the control of ventilation by arterial blood-gas levels, and (4) how afferent feedback and higher CNS centers modulate ventilation.

## NEURONS THAT CONTROL VENTILATION

## The neurons that generate the respiratory rhythm are located in the medulla

A classical method for determining which parts of the CNS (1) N32-2 are responsible for controlling respiratory output is to transect the neuraxis at different levels and to observe changes in breathing. Using this approach in the second century, Galen was the first to determine the location of the respiratory controller. As a physician for gladiators in the Greek city of Pergamon, he observed that breathing stopped after a sword blow to the high cervical spine. A similar blow to the lower cervical spine paralyzed the arms and legs, but allowed respiration to continue. He reproduced these lesions in live animals and correctly concluded that the brain sends information via the midcervical spinal cord to the diaphragm.

Eighteen centuries later, Lumsden used a similar approach in cats. He found that transection of the CNS between the medulla and spinal cord (Fig. 32-2, spinomedullary transection) causes ventilation to cease as a result of loss of the descending input to phrenic and intercostal motor neurons in the spinal cord. However, even after a spinomedullary transection, respiratory activity continues in muscles innervated by motor neurons whose cell bodies reside in the brainstem. During the period that would have been an inspiration, the nostrils continue to flare, and the muscles of the tongue, pharynx, and larynx continue to maximize airway caliber-although this respiratory activity cannot sustain life. Thus, spinomedullary transection blocks ventilation by interrupting output to the diaphragm, not by eliminating the respiratory rhythm. We can conclude that the neural machinery driving ventilation lies above the spinal cord.

When Lumsden, in the 1940s, made a transection between the pons and the medulla (see Fig. 32-2, pontomedullary transection), he noticed that breathing continued, but with an abnormal "gasping" pattern. Others have since observed relatively normal breathing after a transection at this level, and concluded that the gasping seen by Lumsden was due to surgical damage to the respiratory CPG in the rostral medulla. Today, most respiratory neurophysiologists believe that the respiratory CPG is located in the medulla and that other sites, including the pons, only shape the respiratory output to produce the normal pattern. (1) N32-3

## The pons modulates-but is not essential for-respiratory output

Although the medulla alone can generate a basic respiratory rhythm, both higher CNS centers and sensory inputs finetune this rhythm. For example, the pons contains neurons that affect respiratory output.

Lumsden found that a midpons transection has only a modest effect: an increase in tidal volume and a slight decrease in respiratory rate. A bilateral vagotomy-interrupting the two vagus nerves, which carry sensory information from pulmonary stretch receptors-has a similar but smaller effect. However, combining a midpons transection with a bilateral vagotomy causes the animal to make a prolonged inspiratory effort-inspiratory apneusis-that is terminated by a brief expiration. A brainstem transection above the pons does not alter the basic respiratory pattern of eupnea. These observations led Lumsden to propose that (1) the caudal pons contains an apneustic center (i.e., it can cause apneusis), and (2) the rostral pons contains a pneumotaxic center that prevents apneusis (i.e., it promotes coordinated respirations). He believed that these two regions and the medulla are required for normal breathing. (1) N32-4 Although this viewpoint is common in current literature, it is held by only a minority of respiratory physiologists.

What is the modern view? We now appreciate that the apneustic center is not a specific nucleus but is distributed diffusely throughout the caudal pons. The pneumotaxic center is located in the nucleus parabrachialis medialis and adjacent Kölliker-Fuse nucleus in the rostral pons. However, the pneumotaxic center is not unique in preventing apneusis because simply increasing the temperature of the animal can reverse apneusis induced by lesions in the pneumotaxic

# N32-2 Experimental Preparations for Studying the Neural Control of Ventilation 

## Contributed by George Richerson

One of the most difficult challenges in neurobiology today is to understand how neurons function within neural networks to generate normal behaviors. Although it is one of the most primitive in the mammalian brain, the neural network controlling respiration is still highly complex. The experimental preparations and techniques used to study respiration are also shared by neuroscientists studying other neural networks and include the following:

Intact, awake, behaving animals and humans are used to permit direct correlation of results with behavior. Investigators primarily use this approach to measure body movements, lung volume changes, or electrical activity in muscles or peripheral nerves.

Anesthetized, paralyzed, mechanically ventilated animals are used to permit better control of experimental variables and more intensive surgical techniques. Paralysis reduces movement of the brain so that individual neurons can be studied using extracellular recordings of single neurons.

The whole brain or large portions of the brain can be isolated in vitro by perfusing the brain via the arterial system, or by removing the spinal cord and lower brainstem of a neonatal rat from the body and keeping them alive submerged in artificial CSF. Because the brainstem circuitry is intact, a respiratory rhythm may still be produced. Elimination of the lungs and heart results in reduction of movement, which makes intracellular recording easier.

Brain slices are prepared by cutting the medulla into thin slices and are kept alive in artificial CSF. These slices can be used
to study individual neurons in relative isolation; for example, with intracellular microelectrodes or patch-clamp recordings. Simple synaptic connections, limited to a restricted subset of those present in vivo, can also be studied.

Dissociated neurons can be studied immediately or after days or weeks in tissue culture. These approaches isolate neurons from synaptic input and permit highly stable recordings so that their biophysical properties can be studied with a high degree of precision and control.

These approaches to studying neural networks are at the same time very powerful and very limited. Results can vary depending on the species studied, on age, and on whether the subject is awake or anesthetized. Each experimental preparation has advantages for answering specific questions, as well as disadvantages. For example, it is not possible to define the properties of individual neurons while they are still part of a complex neural network. On the other hand, the respiratory rhythm is usually no longer present in "reduced" preparations, which makes it difficult to know if a given neuron is actually involved in respiratory control. All of these approaches suffer, more or less, from effects due to measurement of the responses-the biological equivalent of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. There is ischemia in the center of en-bloc tissue, traumatic damage of neurons in brain slices, dedifferentiation of some neuronal properties in culture, and effects of anesthetics and prolonged surgery in vivo. For this reason, it is important that each result be verified and each theory be tested using many of these approaches, instead of relying on only one.

## N32-3 Evolution of the Respiratory Central Pattern Generator

## Contributed by George Richerson

The medulla actually has two identical respiratory CPGs-one on each side. All of the elements of the respiratory controllerdrive inputs, sensory feedback, RRNs, and motor neuronsare bilateral. Thus, after a midsagittal transection, each side of the medulla generates an independent respiratory rhythm. As noted in the textbook, the location of the respiratory CPG is not universally agreed upon.

The respiratory CPG probably evolved in fish, where bloodgas exchange across the gills requires pumping by branchial structures; this necessity explains why the CPG is located in the medulla. CPGs generate all repetitive motor activities (see pp. 396-397). In invertebrates, these include swimming in sea slugs and movements of the stomach in lobsters. The mechanisms of rhythm generation discovered in these systems have led to establishment of general principles that have been valuable in promoting understanding of CPGs in mammals.

center. Moreover, lesions in many locations outside the pneumotaxic center can also induce apneusis. Today we still do not understand the role of the apneustic center, and the consensus is that the pneumotaxic center plays a general role in a variety of brainstem functions-including breathingbut is not required for eupnea (Box 32-2). Thus, the terms apneustic center and pneumotaxic center are generally of only historical significance.

## The dorsal and ventral respiratory groups contain many neurons that fire in phase with respiratory motor output

In the 1930s, Gesell (ㄱ) N32-5 and colleagues used extracellular microelectrode recordings to monitor single neurons, finding that many neurons within the medulla increase their firing rate during one of the phases of the respiratory cycle. Some of these neurons fire more frequently during inspira-tion-inspiratory neurons-whereas others fire more often during expiration-expiratory neurons.

Not all neurons that fire in phase with the respiratory cycle are involved in control of breathing. For example, because they are located within the chest cavity, aortic baroreceptors (see p. 534) produce an output that varies with
lung inflation, but they are primarily involved in the control of cardiovascular-not respiratory-function. Conversely, some neurons whose firing does not correlate with the respiratory cycle may be essential for respiratory control. For example, central chemoreceptors may fire tonically (i.e., they do not burst during inspiration) and yet are critical for maintaining respiratory output by providing tonic drive (see pp. 700-701). Thus, not all RRNs (e.g., those stimulated by the aortic baroreceptors) play a direct role in respiration, and respiratory control involves more than just RRNs (e.g., chemoreceptor neurons).

Although electrical recordings from RRNs cannot identify all neurons necessary for producing respiratory output, this mapping has proved very useful in defining neurons that are candidates for controlling ventilation. On each side of the medulla, two large concentrations of RRNs-the dorsal and ventral respiratory groups-are grossly organized into sausage-shaped columns, oriented along the long axis of the medulla (Fig. 32-4). Many neurons of these two regions tend to fire exclusively during either inspiration or expiration.

The pons also contains RRNs. (O) N32-4 Although, as discussed above, pontine neurons may not be needed to

# BOX 32-2 Normal and Abnormal Respiratory Patterns 

Respiratory output can change for a variety of reasons. Many patterns, both normal and abnormal, have recognizable characteristics summarized below. Figure 32-3 illustrates some of these.

Eupnea Normal breathing.
Sighs Larger than normal breaths (see Box 32-4) that occur automatically at regular intervals in normal subjects, possibly to counteract collapse of alveoli (atelectasis).

Yawn An exaggerated sigh (see Box 32-4).
Tachypnea An increase in respiratory rate.
Hyperventilation An increase in alveolar ventilation (see pp. 675-676)—caused by an increase in respiratory frequency or an increase in tidal volume-that decreases arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Seen in pregnancy and liver cirrhosis (due to increased progesterone), in panic attacks, and as a compensation to metabolic acidosis (see p. 642).

Kussmaul Breathing Extremely deep, rapid breathing seen with metabolic acidosis, such as in diabetic ketoacidosis (see p. 1185).

Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation Rapid, deep breathing causing a decrease in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$. Although first described in a small number of patients with focal brain lesions, it is now believed that this pattern reflected coexisting lung disease or other systemic illness in the majority of these patients.

Cheyne-Stokes Respiration A benign respiratory pattern. Cycles of a gradual increase in tidal volume, followed by a gradual decrease in tidal volume, and then a period of apnea. Seen with bilateral cortical disease or congestive heart failure, or in healthy people during sleep at high altitude.

Gasping Maximal, brief inspiratory efforts separated by long periods of expiration. Seen in severe anoxia, as well as in terminal, agonal breathing exhibited by patients with brainstem lesions or cardiac arrest.

Apneusis (Inspiratory) Prolonged inspirations separated by brief expirations, typically seen in animals with lesions of the rostral pons plus bilateral vagotomy. Rarely seen in humans.

Apnea Cessation of respiration.
Vagal Breathing Slow, deep inspirations caused by interruption of vagus nerve input to the brainstem. Rarely seen in humans.

Ataxic Breathing Highly irregular inspirations, often separated by long periods of apnea. Seen mainly with medullary lesions.

Cluster Breathing Similar to ataxic breathing, with groups of breaths, often of differing amplitude, separated by long periods of apnea. Seen with medullary or pontine lesions.

Biot Breathing First described in patients with meningitis by Biot (in 1876), with breaths of nearly equal volume separated by periods of apnea. Biot breathing is also considered to be a variant of ataxic or cluster breathing.

These are dorsal views of the brainstem and spinal cord, with the cerebellum removed. The dorsal respiratory group (DRG) includes the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS). The ventral respiratory group (VRG) includes the Bötzinger complex (BötC), pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), nucleus ambiguus (NA), nucleus para-ambigualis (NPA), and nucleus retroambigualis (NRA). The color coding indicates whether the neurons are primarily inspiratory (red) or primarily expiratory (green).

produce a normal respiratory rhythm, they can influence respiratory output.

## The dorsal respiratory group processes sensory input and contains primarily inspiratory neurons

The dorsal respiratory group (DRG) primarily contains inspiratory neurons (Table 32-2). It extends for about one third of the length of the medulla and is located bilaterally in and around the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS), which receives sensory input from all viscera of the thorax and abdomen and plays an important role in control of the autonomic nervous system (see p. 348). The NTS is viscerotopically organized, with the respiratory portion of the NTS
ventrolateral to the tractus solitarius, just beneath the floor of the caudal end of the fourth ventricle (see Fig. 32-4). These NTS neurons, as well as some immediately adjacent neurons in the dorsal medulla, make up the DRG.

As might be surmised from the sensory role of the NTS, one of the major functions of the DRG is the integration of sensory information from the respiratory system. Indeed, some of the DRG neurons receive sensory input-via the glossopharyngeal (CN IX) and vagus (CN X) nerves-from peripheral chemoreceptors, as well as from receptors in the lungs and airways (see above). Some of the RRNs in the DRG are local interneurons. Others are premotor neurons, projecting directly to various pools of motor neurons-primarily inspiratory-in the spinal cord and ventral respiratory group (see Fig. 32-4). (1) N32-6

For example, an interneuron in the DRG may synapse on a DRG premotor neuron, which, in turn, may descend into the spinal cord and reach one of the paired phrenic motor nuclei in the ventral horn of the spinal cord. There, the premotor neuron synapses on the cell bodies of phrenic motor neurons, whose axons follow the phrenic nerve to the diaphragm.

## N32-8 Origin of the Terms Bötzinger Complex and Pre-Bötzinger Complex

## Contributed by Emile Boulpaep and Walter Boron

The Bötzinger complex-the most rostral portion of the VRGis not named after a scientist or even a grateful patient. Rather, the Bötzinger complex received its name from Professor Jack Feldman (currently of the University of California, Los Angeles) while he was at a banquet for a scientific meeting in Hirschhorn, Germany, in 1978.

Feldman had discovered this region and reported on it at a meeting in Stockholm the previous year, but had not published the work. At the Hirschhorn meeting, a colleague who had been at the Stockholm meeting presented some new data based on Feldman's previous presentation. Worrying that this forgotten corner of the medulla would go unnamed-or, worse yet, be named after the wrong person-Feldman proposed a toast in which he suggested that this anatomical area be named after some aspect of the Hirschhorn meeting. So Professor Feldman picked up the bottle of wine that happened to be at the table-

Bötzinger (a rather unremarkable white wine)—and the rest is neurophysiological history ... the Bötzinger complex.

Twelve years later, Feldman and his colleagues identified an area slightly caudal to the Bötzinger complex. This area appeared to be the source of the respiratory rhythm in the preparation with which they were working. The group thought that the logical name-the post-Bötzinger complex-would connote less importance than the authors thought the region deserved. So they chose the anatomically incorrect pre-Bötzinger complex. The reviewers of the subsequent paper seemed not to notice, and the name stuck.

## The ventral respiratory group is primarily motor and contains both inspiratory and expiratory neurons

The ventral respiratory group (VRG) (5) N32-7 contains both inspiratory and expiratory neurons (see Table 32-2). It is ventral to the DRG, about midway between the dorsal and ventral surfaces of the medulla. The VRG lies within and around a series of nuclei that form a column of neurons extending from the pons nearly to the spinal cord and is thus considerably longer than the DRG (see Fig. 32-4). Like the DRG, the VRG contains local interneurons and premotor neurons. In contrast to the DRG, the VRG also contains motor neurons that innervate muscles of the pharynx and larynx, as well as viscera of the thorax and abdomen. Sensory information related to pulmonary function comes indirectly via the DRG. Thus, the VRG plays more of an efferent role, whereas the DRG primarily plays an afferent role.

The VRG consists of three regions that perform specific functions. (1) The rostral VRG or Bötzinger complex (BötC) (5) N32-8 contains interneurons that drive the expiratory activity of the caudal region. (2) The intermediate VRG (5) N32-7 contains somatic motor neurons whose axons leave the medulla via CN IX and CN X. These fibers supply the pharynx, larynx, and other structures, thus maximizing the caliber of the upper airways during inspiration. The intermediate VRG also contains premotor neurons that project to inspiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and medulla. Within the rostral pole of the intermediate VRG is a group of inspiratory neurons defined as the pre-Bötzinger complex (preBötC), which, as we will see below, may be part of the respiratory CPG, contributing to generation of the respiratory rhythm. (3) The caudal VRG contains expiratory premotor neurons that travel down the spinal cord to synapse on motor neurons that innervate accessory muscles of expiration, such as abdominal and certain intercostal muscles (see p. 608).

## GENERATION OF THE RESPIRATORY RHYTHM

## Different RRNs fire at different times during inspiration and expiration

Eupneic breathing is highly stereotyped and consists of two major phases-inspiration and expiration (Fig. 32-5A, B). During the inspiratory phase, phrenic nerve output to the diaphragm gradually increases in activity during 0.5 to 2 seconds and then declines precipitously at the onset of expiration (see Fig. 32-5C). The ramp increase in activity helps to ensure a smooth increase in lung volume. During the expiratory phase, the phrenic nerve is inactive, exceptin some cases-for a brief burst at the onset. Some physiologists consider this "postinspiratory" burst to represent its own phase.

Underlying the activity of the phrenic nerve-and the other motor nerves supplying the muscles of inspiration and expiration-is a spectrum of firing patterns of RRNs located within the DRG and VRG (see above). RRNs can be broadly classified as inspiratory or expiratory, but each class includes many subtypes, based on how their firing patterns correlate with the respiratory cycle. Figure 32-5D and E shows two

Figure 32-5 Neural activity during the respiratory cycle. The activity of RRNs in the medulla (examples of which are shown in D and E) leads to the phasic activity of the phrenic nerve (C) and other respiratory nerves, which produces airflow (B), causing lung volume to change (A).

such patterns. (5) N32-9 Each subtype presumably plays a unique role in generating and shaping respiratory outputthat is, the activity of the nerves to each respiratory muscle. RRNs may be further subclassified on the basis of their responses to afferent inputs, such as lung inflation and changes in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

## The firing patterns of RRNs depend on the ion channels in their membranes and the synaptic inputs they receive

What are the mechanisms for generating so many types of activity in RRNs? For example, if the RRN is a premotor neuron, its firing pattern must be appropriate for driving a motor neuron, such as one in the phrenic nerve nucleus. Two complementary mechanisms appear to contribute to the firing patterns necessary for the neuron to do its job. (1) The intrinsic membrane properties of RRNs-the complement and distribution of ion channels present in a neuroninfluence the firing pattern of that neuron. (2) The synaptic input-excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)-changes with an

# N32-7 Ventral Respiratory Group 

## Contributed by George Richerson

Aside from input from muscle spindle fibers (see p. 388), which provide feedback to pharyngeal and laryngeal motor neurons, the VRG does not receive any monosynaptic sensory input.

## Rostral VRG

Within the nucleus retrofacialis is a region known as the Bötzinger complex. This region is the rostral VRG, which contains primarily expiratory interneurons projecting to other respiratory nuclei, including the caudal VRG.

## Intermediate VRG

Within and near the nucleus ambiguus and the nucleus paraambigualis is the intermediate VRG. The majority of RRNs in the intermediate VRG are inspiratory. The nucleus ambiguus contains somatic motor neurons that leave the medulla via CN IX and $X$ to supply the larynx and pharynx and prevent collapse of the upper airways during inspiration. In addition, this nucleus contains parasympathetic preganglionic neurons that supply airways in the lung and other structures via CN X. Finally, the nucleus ambiguus contains some motor neurons with respiration-related activity that send axons out the trigeminal nerve (CN V), presumably for opening the mouth; the facial nerve (CN VII), for flaring the nostrils; and the accessory nerve (CN XI), for activating other accessory muscles of respiration during strong inspirations.

The nucleus para-ambigualis surrounds the nucleus ambiguus and contains premotor neurons that project to inspiratory motor neurons in the spinal cord and interneurons that have local
connections to other neurons of the medulla. Like some neurons in the DRG, the inspiratory premotor neurons in the nucleus para-ambigualis drive primary muscles of inspiration. However, unlike neurons in the DRG, the inspiratory premotor neurons in the nucleus para-ambigualis also drive accessory muscles.

The pre-Bötzinger complex (see p. 706) is in the rostral portion of the intermediate VRG. It is not yet well defined anatomically, but instead is defined by the electrophysiological properties of its component neurons, which continue to produce bursts of respiratory activity in brain slices. The anatomical location roughly corresponds to a region slightly ventral and lateral to the nucleus ambiguus just caudal to the Bötzinger complex. The pre-Bötzinger complex contains inspiratory neurons that include local interneurons and premotor neurons. There is evidence that this region may be the respiratory CPG.

## Caudal VRG

Within the nucleus retroambigualis is the caudal portion of the VRG, which contains mostly expiratory premotor neurons. Many of these travel down the spinal cord to synapse on motor neurons that innervate muscles of expiration, such as the internal intercostal and abdominal muscles. Because a quiet expiration is a passive event, these are accessory muscles of expiration. Thus, the premotor neurons in the caudal VRG are normally silent and become active only during forced expirations. These premotor neurons appear to receive their stimulatory drive from neurons in the rostral VRG.

# N32-9 Neural Activity During the Respiratory Cycle 

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Some RRNs fire mostly during early inspiration, others evenly throughout in inspiration, and still others during late expiration or evenly throughout expiration. Some fire during both inspiration and expiration, but with a peak of activity during one of the two phases of ventilation.
eFigure 32-1 is an expansion of Figure 32-5. eFigure 32-1 includes four additional panels: E, F, G, and I. Panel E in Figure 32-5 is the same as panel $H$ in eFigure 32-1.

As shown in Figure 32-5C-as well as eFigure 32-1C-the activity of the phrenic nerve varies in a characteristic way during the phases of the respiratory cycle. During the inspiratory phase, phrenic nerve output to the diaphragm gradually increases in activity over 0.5 to 2 seconds, followed by a precipitous decline at the onset of expiration. The ramp increase in activity helps to ensure a smooth increase in lung volume. Although not evident in eFigure 32-1C, during the first expiratory phase $\left|\mathbf{E}_{1}\right|$, or the postinspiratory phase), there may be a paradoxical burst of activity in the phrenic nerve. This burst offsets the large elastic recoil of the lungs at the end of inspiration. This elastic recoil would tend to collapse the lungs rapidly if the tone of the inspiratory muscles decreased too abruptly.

During the second expiratory phase $\left(E_{2}\right)$, the phrenic nerve is inactive. During a quiet expiration, which is normally a passive event, the accessory muscles of expiration are also inactive. However, during a forced expiration, the accessory muscles of expiration (e.g., internal intercostals, abdominal muscles) become active during $E_{2}$.

Underlying the activity of the phrenic nerve-and the other motor nerves supplying the muscles of inspiration and expirationis a spectrum of firing patterns of different RRNs throughout the medulla, some of which are shown in eFigure 32-1D-I. RRNs can be broadly classified as inspiratory or expiratory, but for each class there are many subtypes of RRNs, each presumably with different functions in generating and shaping the "respiratory output"-that is, the activity of the nerves to each of the respiratory muscles.

The tracings in eFigure 32-1 are idealized drawings. These recordings would have been made in a preparation such as the brain of a cat with an extracellular electrode recording the activity of a particular RRN. A cuff electrode on the phrenic nerve would have simultaneously recorded the activity of the phrenic nerve. All the panels in eFigure 32-1 relate to the condition of eupnea. In the following descriptions, the letters refer to the panel designations:
A. Lung volume. Note that inspiration is shorter than expiration.
B. Airflow. Airflow into the lung is represented by a downward deflection in the record. Note that the air flow is zero when lung volume is not changing (e.g., at the transition from inspiration to expiration).
C. Phrenic-nerve activity. The panel shows a typical waveform of phrenic nerve output during eupnea.
D. An RRN with inspiratory-ramp activity. Note that the neuron fires during inspiration with a gradually increasing firing rate.
E. An RRN with early-burst activity. The neuron fires during early inspiration and then with a decrementing firing rate.
F. An RRN with constant inspiratory activity. The neuron fires with a relatively constant rate during inspiration.
G. An RRN with late-onset inspiratory activity. The neuron is silent except for a short burst late in inspiration. This neuron could be part of an "off-switch" that terminates inspiration.
H. An RRN with early-expiratory activity. The neuron fires during $E_{1}$, immediately after inspiration (postinspiratory), and then the firing rate decrements.
I. An RRN with expiratory-ramp activity. The firing rate gradually increases during $E_{2}$.
The various groups of respiratory neurons in the brainstem consist of networks of neurons with firing patterns such as those outlined in the previous passage. Although the precise role each type of RRN plays in generating and shaping the respiratory motor output is unknown, it is instructive to consider some of the neurons that make up, for example, the DRG. In the DRG, most RRNs (>90\%) are inspiratory, and three of the most common of these are known as $\mathrm{I} \alpha, \mathrm{I} \beta$, and P neurons.
Iß neurons (the I stands for "inspiratory") fire with a ramp pattern (see eFig. 32-1D), presumably because they are driven by the central inspiratory activity that drives inspiration. In addition, they receive sensory input directly from pulmonary stretch receptors; lung inflation stimulates $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons. Many $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons do not send their axons to the spinal cord, but instead are interneurons whose axons synapse locally within the DRG. Thus, $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons probably integrate sensory information from pulmonary stretch receptors and may play a key role in some respiratory reflexes, such as the Hering-Breuer reflex (see p. 706).

P neurons, unlike the $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons, are not driven by the central inspiratory activity. However, they do receive direct input from pulmonary stretch receptors, so that their activity simply tracks changes in lung volume. Thus, like the $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons, the P neurons presumably are important for sensory integration.
I $\alpha$ neurons, like $\mathrm{I} \beta$ neurons, fire with a ramp pattern (see eFig. 32-1D). Input from other DRG neurons tends to inhibit $\mathrm{I} \alpha$ neurons with increases in lung inflation. I $\alpha$ neurons are premotor neurons; their axons synapse on phrenic motor neurons and external intercostal motor neurons. That is, the firing of an I $\alpha$ neuron indirectly tends to cause a muscle of inspiration to contract. Thus, it is not surprising that the firing pattern of the $\mathrm{I} \alpha$ neurons is similar to that of the phrenic nerve. Collaterals of $\mathrm{I} \alpha$ neurons also branch off and synapse on neurons in the VRG.

appropriate pattern during the respiratory cycle and thereby generates a specific firing pattern.

Intrinsic Membrane Properties Many neurons in respiratory nuclei have intrinsic membrane properties that influence the types of firing patterns they are able to produce. For example, many DRG neurons have a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current called a transient A-type current (see p. 193). If we first hyperpolarize and then depolarize such a neuron, it begins firing action potentials, but only after a delay. The hyperpolarization removes the inactivation of the A-type current, and the subsequent depolarization transiently activates the A-type $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current and transiently slows depolarization of the membrane and inhibits generation of action potentials (see Fig. 7-18C). If the A-type current is large, the neuron cannot begin to fire until after the A-type current sufficiently inactivates (see Fig. 7-18D). The delay in firing of a neuron with A-type current can explain why some RRNs fire only late during inspiration, even though they receive EPSPs continuously during inspiration. As we will see, other neurons have pacemaker properties due to their complement of ion channels, which allows them to fire action bursts of potentials spontaneously without synaptic input. (5) N32-10

Synaptic Input The most obvious explanation for a neuron's having a specific firing pattern is that it receives excitatory synaptic input when it is supposed to fire action potentials and receives inhibitory synaptic input when it is quiet. Indeed, some RRNs fire only during early inspiration (see Fig. 32-5E), when they receive strong excitatory synaptic input. These early inspiratory neurons also inhibit late-onset inspiratory neurons, and vice versa (Fig. 32-6). (5) N32-11 As a result of this reciprocal inhibition, only one of the two subtypes of inspiratory neurons can be maximally active at a time.

In addition to receiving synaptic input from RRNs that occurs rhythmically, in phase with breathing, respiratory neurons also receive input from other neuronal systems. This input can either interrupt regular breathing or control the level of ventilation, allowing the respiratory system to respond appropriately to challenges and to be integrated with many different brain functions.

## Pacemaker properties and synaptic interactions may both contribute to the generation of the respiratory rhythm

Perhaps the most important questions that still need to be answered about the neural control of breathing revolve around the mechanism and identity (or location) of the respiratory CPG. We address the mechanism in this section, and which cells are involved in the next.

Two general theories have evolved for the mechanism of the respiratory CPG. The first posits that subsets of neurons have pacemaker activity; the second, that synaptic interactions create the rhythm.

Pacemaker Activity Some cells have ion channels that endow them with pacemaker properties (see pp. 397-398). For example, isolated cardiac myocytes produce rhythmic activity via "pacemaker currents" (see p. 489). Some neurons
![bo147465312c5](bo147465312c5.jpg)

have similar pacemaker activity and repeatedly fire one spike at a time (i.e., beating pacemakers). Other pacemaker neurons repeatedly generate bursts of spikes (i.e., bursting pacemakers).

The first evidence for pacemaker activity in a mammalian respiratory nucleus came from the laboratory of Peter Getting. In brain slices from the guinea pig, putative premotor respiratory neurons in the NTS fire erratically at a low rate, with no apparent respiratory rhythm. However, adding thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH; see p. 1014) to the bathing medium causes these neurons to generate bursts of action potentials (Fig. 32-7A), similar to inspiratory bursts in RRNs of the DRG during eupnea in an intact animal (see Fig. 32-7B). Indeed, axons from the medullary raphé nuclei (see pp. 312-313) project to the NTS, where they release TRH (as well as serotonin and substance P ) and thereby could induce bursting pacemaker activity in NTS neurons. This pacemaker activity might contribute to generation of the respiratory rhythm or augment respiratory output generated within another site. Pacemaker activity is also present in neurons within the preBötC (see p. 708), where serotonin (see Fig. 13-8B)-the main neurotransmitter released by the medullary raphé neurons noted abovecan induce pacemaker activity. (5) N32-12

Synaptic Interactions Neural circuits without pacemaker neurons also can generate rhythmic output (see pp. 397398). Indeed, synaptic connections within and between the DRG and VRG establish neural circuits and generate EPSPs

# N32-10 Dorsal Respiratory Group Neuron with $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-Activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Current 

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

A second type of neuron in the DRG has a large amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current (see p. 196). After the neuron fires several action potentials, the accumulation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ inside the cell slowly activates this $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ channel, hyperpolarizing the cell and limiting the firing rate. Thus, suddenly depolarizing such a neuron triggers a burst of firing that tapers off as $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ channels activate. The decrease in firing rate, called spike-frequency adaptation, mimics the early-burst activity of some RRNs. (c) N32-9 Like the A-type current, $\mathrm{K}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ channels could cause these neurons to have an appropriate firing pattern, even in the absence of rigidly patterned synaptic input.

## N32-11 Patterned Input

## Contributed by George Richerson

Independent of intrinsic membrane properties, the patterned synaptic input that many RRNs receive from other respiratory neurons can also influence the firing pattern. For example, the early-burst activity of the neuron whose firing pattern is shown in the upper panel of Figure 32-6 parallels the strong excitatory synaptic input that the neuron receives during the early part of inspiration as well as the inhibitory synaptic input that it receives during expiration.

Some firing patterns of RRNs result in part from inhibitory connections between neurons. For example, the early-burst inspiratory neurons described in the preceding paragraph appear to inhibit late-onset inspiratory neurons (C) N32-9, specifically eFig. 32-1G), and vice versa. As a result of this reciprocal inhibition, only one of the two subtypes of inspiratory neurons can be maximally active at any one time.

In addition to patterned synaptic input from RRNs, respiratory neurons also receive input from other neuronal systems, which allows the respiratory system to respond appropriately to challenges and to be integrated with many different brain functions. Some of the neurotransmitters released onto respiratory neurons-both by RRNs and by neurons from other regions of the CNS—are listed in eTable 32-1.

In summary, both intrinsic membrane properties and patterned synaptic input can cause RRNs to fire in their characteristic patterns. In theory, either of these properties might be sufficient to ensure that these neurons have the right firing
pattern. The presence of both properties illustrates a general concept that appears to be important in critical biologic systems: redundancy. For those body systems critical for life support, use of multiple mechanisms may ensure that normal functioning will occur despite severe perturbations.

## Contributed by George Richerson and Walter Boron

eFigure 32-2 from an article by Ptak and colleagues shows the results of an experiment on an inspiratory preBötC neuron (see p. 708). This neuron has no intrinsic bursting activity. The bursting that we see in panel $A$ is due to synaptic inputs.

As seen in the left half of panel B, blocking these synaptic inputs with extracellular $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ ions eliminates all activity. In the right half of panel B-still in the presence of $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$-we see that graded depolarizing currents of 15 pA and then 20 pA produce tonic spiking, but not rhythmic bursting.

In panel C, the addition of serotonin ( $5-\mathrm{HT}$ ) to the $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ now causes rhythmic bursting during depolarization. Note that an increased level of depolarizing current (from 15 pA to 20 pA ) in the right portion of this panel increases the frequency of this bursting.

In panel D, washing out the serotonin eliminates the bursting activity.

and IPSPs onto each other with a timing that could explain the oscillatory behavior during the respiratory cycle (see Fig. 32-6). Computational neurobiologists have proposed a variety of pure network models ( $\mathbf{N 3 2 - 1 3}$ of respiratory rhythm generation. According to these models, the CPG that produces the respiratory rhythm depends solely on synaptic connections between subtypes of RRNs and not at all on the pacemaker activity of individual neurons. Thus, the rhythm would be an emergent property of the network.

One of the difficulties with network models of breathing is that not all of the neurons within the respiratory network are known. Network models also must take into account the presence of the rich complement of intrinsic membrane properties that exist in the component neurons, but not all of these are fully characterized either. As a result, pure network models must be very complex to explain all aspects of the normal respiratory rhythm. Supplementing network models with intrinsic membrane properties (e.g., pacemaker activity) allows the models to be simpler. Moreover, from an evolutionary perspective, it is reasonable to infer that pacemaker cells may have driven primitive respiratory systems. In higher organisms, both pacemaker activity and synaptic interactions appear to be involved in generating the normal respiratory rhythm.

## The respiratory CPG for eupnea could reside in a single site or in multiple sites, or could emerge from a complex network

Where is the respiratory CPG for eupnea? In 1851, Flourens proposed a noeud vital [vital node] in the medulla, a small
region that is the sole site producing respiratory output. In 1909, the neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal reported that neurons in the NTS receive afferents from pulmonary stretch receptors and that NTS neurons project directly to the phrenic motor nucleus. He concluded that the NTS is the site of respiratory rhythm generation. However, today-in spite of considerable progress-the question of where in the medulla the CPG is located remains controversial. Here we discuss three major proposals for the location of the respiratory CPG.

Restricted-Site Model Toshihiko Suzue first introduced the in vitro brainstem/spinal cord preparation from the neonatal rat, and Jeffrey Smith and Jack Feldman further developed this preparation to study the generation of respiratory output. In this preparation, a small region in the rostral VRG-the preBötC (see Fig. 32-4)-generates rhythmic motor output in the phrenic nerve and hypoglossal nerve (CN XII, which innervates the tongue, an accessory muscle of inspiration). Destroying the preBötC in the isolated brainstem causes respiratory output to cease. In a slice preparation, the preBötC generates rhythmic bursts of activity that one can record from the hypoglossal nerve rootlets (Fig. 32-8). These bursts require the continuous release of serotonin from raphé neurons onto neurons of the preBötC. These experiments have led to the hypothesis that the preBötC is the site of the respiratory CPG. (c) N32-14

Distributed Oscillator Models A different theory is that there is more than one CPG, any one of which could take over the job of generating the respiratory rhythm, depending

## N32-13 The Central Pattern Generator as an "Emergent Property"

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

One of the network models of respiratory rhythm generation includes three key elements for generating normal inspiratory output: (1) "central inspiratory activity," (2) an integrator, and (3) an inspiratory off-switch. A group of neurons in the DRG would generate central inspiratory activity that would in turn cause a steady increase in firing of premotor neurons (such as the $\mathrm{I} \alpha$ neurons discussed in (1) N32-9) that drive inspiratory motor neurons and the $\mathrm{I} \beta$ interneurons (also discussed in (1) N32-9). The $\mathrm{I} \beta$ interneurons also receive input from the pulmonary stretch receptors. Thus, the $\mathrm{I} \beta$ interneurons "integrate" information from both the command to the inspiratory muscles and the resultant lung inflation. When the integrator determines that the inspiration has proceeded far enough, it triggers the inspiratory "off-switch" neurons, the late-onset inspiratory neurons in eFigure 32-1G. According to the model, the activated inspiratory off-switch neurons cause inspiration to stop by resetting central inspiratory activity, which allows expiration to take over. Expiration is passive and ends when central inspiratory activity builds up enough to initiate firing of inspiratory neurons again.

According to the model, neurons of the so-called pneumotaxic center in the pons can also trigger the inspiratory offswitch. This hypothesis fits with experimental data, because interrupting input from both the pneumotaxic center and the pulmonary stretch receptors (i.e., input carried by vagal afferents) results in loss of the off-switch and thus in apneusis (see p. 702).

One of the difficulties with network models is that the exact identity of each of the components of the model is not certain.

## N32-14 Site of the Respiratory Central Pattern Generator

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Given the long history of the field and the many investigators working on different aspects of the problem, any conclusion about the precise location of a respiratory CPG is bound to be controversial.

In the case of the preBötC (see p. 706), some critics believe that the pattern of respiratory output generated resembles gasping. In addition, the conditions normally used to study the activity are artificial. In addition, destroying the preBötC in adult rats leads to ataxic breathing, and yet the animals survive. However, most investigators agree that the preBötC plays an important role in breathing, and defining the mechanisms of rhythm generation in the preBötC will be important for understanding normal breathing. For example, it is now clear that there are pacemaker neurons within the preBötC. Some of these pacemaker neurons are inhibited by hypoxia, whereas others are unaffected. This observation provides a possible explanation for why the pattern of breathing can change from eupnea to gasping when the oxygen levels in the brain become low, such as from cardiac arrest.

Figure 32-8 Possible role of preBötC as the respiratory CPG. The recordings were made in a brain slice containing the preBötC, a piece of the hypoglossal nucleus, some rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve, and serotonergic neurons.

on the conditions. As already noted, TRH can induce bursting pacemaker activity in DRG neurons. Moreover, a group of neurons in the parafacial respiratory group near the ventral surface of the medulla can also produce rhythmic activity. One interpretation is that various groups of respiratory neurons are latent CPGs and that the location of the dominant CPG can shift during different behaviors. A second interpretation is that the presence of rhythmicity in multiple areas represents redundancy, ensuring that respiratory output does not fail. This design would be analogous to initiation of the heartbeat, in which many cells within the sinoatrial node can be the first to fire, and cells in other parts of the heart can take over if the sinoatrial node fails (see p. 489). In this model, some respiratory neurons with intrinsic oscillatory behavior would contribute to rhythm generation only under unusual conditions (e.g., hypoxia, anesthesia, early in development); under these conditions, the neurons might generate abnormal or pathological respiratory output (e.g., gasping). A third interpretation is that only one CPG exists for eupnea, and that other regions augment the rhythm (and make it more robust) but are unable to generate a rhythm on their own.

Emergent Property Model The most common early explanation for generation of the respiratory rhythm (e.g., that proposed by Lumsden; see p. 702) is that no individual region of the DRG or VRG is sufficient to generate the rhythm but that many of them are necessary. A normal rhythm would require the component neurons in multiple brainstem regions to be "wired up" in a specific way. Some still believe that this view is essentially correct, arguing that none of the individual regions proposed to contain the CPG can produce a pattern of activity with all of the features described during eupnea.

None of the models we have discussed is universally accepted, and some of their elements are not mutually exclusive. The challenges in testing these hypotheses include the complexity of the CNS even at the level of the medulla, the technical difficulty in studying neurons of the mammalian brainstem under conditions that replicate exactly those present in vivo, and the large number of nonrespiratory neurons in the medulla. Yet, because it is primitive both ontogenetically and phylogenetically, the respiratory CPG will probably prove to be far easier to define than most other mammalian neural networks, such as those responsible for consciousness or memory.

## CHEMICAL CONTROL OF VENTILATION

In fulfilling its mission to exchange $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ between the atmosphere and the capillaries of the systemic circulation, the respiratory system attempts to regulate the blood-gas parameters, that is, the arterial levels of $\mathrm{O}_{2}, \mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and pH . These are overwhelmingly the most important influences on breathing. The body senses these parameters via two sets of chemoreceptors-the peripheral chemoreceptors and the central chemoreceptors. Hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis all cause an increase in ventilation, which tends to raise $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, to lower $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and to raise pH , thereby correcting deviations in the three blood-gas parameters. Although small variations in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ occur with activities such as sleep, exercise, talking, and panting, the control of arterial blood gases is so tight in normal individuals that it is rare for arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to change from the normal 40 mm Hg by more than a few mm Hg . Thus, the peripheral and central chemoreceptors form the vital sensory arm of a negative-feedback mechanism that stabilizes arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH .

## PERIPHERAL CHEMORECEPTORS

## Peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid and aortic bodies) respond to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis

A decrease in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ is the primary stimulus for the peripheral chemoreceptors. Increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and decreases in pH also stimulate these receptors and make them more responsive to hypoxia.

Sensitivity to Decreased Arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ Perfusion of the carotid body with blood having a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$-but a normal $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH - causes a prompt and reversible increase in the firing rate of axons in the carotid sinus nerve. Figure 32-9A shows an illustrative experiment on an isolated chemoreceptor cell of the carotid body. Under normal acid-base conditions, increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ above the normal value of $\sim 100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ has only trivial effects on the firing rate of the nerve. However, at normal values of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH (see Fig. 32-9B, blue curve), decreasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to values $<100 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ causes a progressive increase in the firing rate.

Sensitivity to Increased Arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ The carotid body can sense hypercapnia in the absence of hypoxia or acidosis. During in vitro experiments, it is possible to maintain a constant extracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}\right)$ while increasing $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ by keeping the ratio $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right] / \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ constant (see p. 641). The maroon curve in Figure 32-9C shows the results of experiments in which graded increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-at a fixed blood pH of 7.45 and a fixed $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ of 80 mm Hg -produced graded increases in the firing rate of the carotid sinus nerve.

Sensitivity to Decreased Arterial pH The carotid body also can sense acidosis in the absence of hypoxia or hypercapnia. The green curve in Figure 32-9C shows the results of experiments that are the same as those represented by the maroon curve, except that blood pH was fixed at 7.25 rather than at 7.45 . Over the entire range of $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ values, the firing rate of the carotid sinus nerve is greater at a pH of 7.25 than at 7.45 . Thus, metabolic acidosis (see p. 635) stimulates the carotid body.

In summary, besides being sensitive to hypoxia, the carotid body is sensitive to both components of respiratory acidosis (see p. 633)-high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and low pH . In fact, respiratory acidosis makes the carotid body more sensitive to hypoxia (see Fig. 32-9B, orange curve), whereas respiratory alkalosis has the opposite effect (see Fig. 32-9B, red curve).

## The glomus cell is the chemosensor in the carotid and aortic bodies

The body has two sets of peripheral chemoreceptors: the carotid bodies, one located at the bifurcation of each of the common carotid arteries, and the aortic bodies, scattered along the underside of the arch of the aorta (Fig. 32-10A). The carotid bodies should not be confused with the carotid sinus (see pp. 534-535), which is the bulbous initial portion of the internal carotid artery that serves as a baroreceptor. Similarly, the aortic bodies should not be confused with baroreceptors of the aortic arch.

The major function of the carotid and aortic bodies is to sense hypoxia in the arterial blood and signal cells in the

medulla to increase ventilation. This signaling occurs via afferents of the glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) for the carotid bodies and of the vagus nerve (CN X) for the aortic bodies. The carotid bodies have been more extensively studied than the aortic bodies, which are smaller and less accessible. For the first description of their function as chemoreceptors, Corneille Heymans was awarded the 1938 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine. (5) N32-15

Aside from their chemosensitivity, three features characterize the carotid bodies. First, they are extremely small: each weighs only $\sim 2 \mathrm{mg}$. Second, for their size, they receive an extraordinarily high blood flow-the greatest of any tissue in the body. Their blood flow, normalized for weight, is $\sim 40$-fold higher than that of the brain. Third, they have a very high metabolic rate, 2- to 3-fold greater than that of the brain. Thus, even though the metabolic rate is high, the blood flow is so much higher that the composition of blood (e.g., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH ) in carotid body capillaries approaches that of systemic arteries.

The chemosensitive cells of the carotid body are the type I or glomus cells. They are $\sim 10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter, are roughly spherical, and occur in clusters (see Fig. 32-10B). Adjacent glomus cells may communicate with each other via gap junctions. Glomus cells are neuroectodermal in origin and share many characteristics with neurons of the peripheral nervous system as well as with adrenal chromaffin cells (see p. 1030). Indeed, glomus cells have four neuron-like characteristics:

1. Some are innervated by preganglionic sympathetic neurons.
2. They have a variety of voltage-gated ion channels.
3. Depolarization triggers action potentials.
4. They have numerous intracellular vesicles containing a variety of neurotransmitters-acetylcholine, dopamine, norepinephrine, substance $P$, and met-enkephalin-that are released upon depolarization. These neurotransmitters control firing of the sensory nerve endings.

Sensory endings of the carotid sinus nerve (a branch of CN IX) impinge on carotid body glomus cells. Neurotransmitter release from the glomus cells triggers action potentials in the carotid sinus nerve, which makes its first synapse on neurons of the NTS (part of the DRG) and thereby signals the medulla that the systemic arterial blood has a low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, or a low pH . (5) N32-16

Surrounding individual clusters of glomus cells are the type II or sustentacular cells (see Fig. 32-10B), which are supporting cells similar to glia. Also close to the glomus cells is a dense network of fenestrated capillaries. This vascular anatomy as well as the exceptionally high blood flow puts the glomus cells in an ideal position to monitor the arterial blood gases with fidelity.

Both the sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system innervate the carotid body. As already noted, preganglionic sympathetic neurons synapse on glomus cells and presumably can alter their function. Autonomic fibers also contact blood vessels; increased sympathetic tone decreases local blood flow. Because the metabolic rate of the carotid body is high, a large decrease in blood flow produces a local fall in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ near the glomus cells, even when systemic arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ remains constant. Increased sympathetic tone thus "fools" the carotid body into behaving as if a hypoxic state existed. Hence, by modulating blood flow to the carotid body, the autonomic

## N32-16 The Glomus Cell

nervous system can fine-tune the response of the peripheral chemoreceptors.

The aortic bodies also include scattered glomus cells that presumably have functions similar to those of glomus cells in the carotid bodies. However, aortic and carotid bodies exhibit distinct differences in their responses to stimuli and the effects they have on ventilation. For the purposes of this section, we focus our discussion here on the carotid bodies, about which more is known.

## Hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis inhibit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, raise glomus cell $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, and release neurotransmitters

The sensitivity of the glomus cell to hypoxia, hypercapnia, and acidosis is a special case of chemoreception that we discussed in connection with sensory transduction (see p. 354). It is interesting that one cell type-the glomus cellis able to sense all three blood-gas parameters. The final common pathway for the response to all three stimuli (Fig. 32-11) is an inhibition of $\mathrm{BK} \mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see p. 196), depolarization of the glomus cell, possible firing of action potentials, opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, an increase in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{i}$, secretion of neurotransmitters, and stimulation of
the afferent nerve fiber. What differs among the three pathways is how the stimulus inhibits $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels.

Hypoxia (c) N32-17 Investigators have proposed three mechanisms by which low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ might inhibit $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. First, some evidence suggests that a heme-containing protein responds to a decrease in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ by lowering the open probability of closely associated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Second, in rabbit glomus cells, hypoxia raises [cAMP] $\mathrm{i}_{\mathrm{i}}$, which inhibits a cAMP-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$current. Third, small decreases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ inhibit reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase) in mitochondria, thus increasing the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG; see p. 955), which directly inhibits certain $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The relative roles of the three pathways may depend on the species. Regardless of how hypoxia inhibits which $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, the resulting depolarization activates voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels.

Hypercapnia An increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to move into the glomus cell, thereby generating $\mathrm{H}^{+}$(see p. 646) and leading to a virtually instantaneous fall of intracellular $\mathrm{pH}\left(\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}\right)$. As pH , decreases, the protons appear to inhibit

Recent progress on the physiology of glomus cells has largely been a result of the ability to study glomus cells in culture and in the isolated carotid body in vitro.

Regarding the model in Figure 32-11, some controversywhich may reflect species differences-exists about which $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is the target of hypoxia. Some evidence favors the charybdotoxin-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. Other data point to a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-insensitive voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and a voltage-insensitive "resting" $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel.

Although one report (Williams et al, 2004) suggested that hemoxygenase-2 (HO-2) is a universal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ sensor, the results of a later study (Ortega-Sáenz et al, 2006) showed that mice deficient in HO-2 have a normal ability to sense a decrease in $\left[\mathrm{O}_{2}\right]$.

Extracellular Acidosis A decrease in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ inhibits acidbase transporters (e.g., $\mathrm{Na} / \mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ cotransporters) that elevate $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and stimulates acid-base transporters (e.g., $\mathrm{Cl}-\mathrm{HCO}_{3}$ exchangers) that lower $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$, thereby leading to a slow fall in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (see pp. 645-646). Thus, even at a constant $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, extracellular acidosis (i.e., metabolic acidosis) triggers the same cascade of events as was outlined above for hypercapnia, albeit more slowly.

## CENTRAL CHEMORECEPTORS

When the blood-gas parameters are nearly normal, the central chemoreceptors are the primary source of feedback for assessing the effectiveness of ventilation and also the major source of tonic drive for breathing. Just as the peripheral chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to arterial hypoxia, the neurons that act as central chemoreceptors are primarily sensitive to arterial hypercapnia, which generally presents itself as respiratory acidosis (i.e., a decrease in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ brought about by a rise in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$; see p. 633). However, the actual parameter sensed appears to be a low pH in or around the chemoreceptor neurons.

## The blood-brain barrier separates the central chemoreceptors in the medulla from arterial blood

In the 1950s, Isidore Leusen-working on dogs with denervated peripheral chemoreceptors-found that ventilation increased when he perfused the cerebral ventricles with an acidic solution having a high $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Because the resultant hyperventilation caused a respiratory alkalosis in the blood, it must have been the local acidosis in the brain that raised ventilation. From this and later experiments, we now believe that the primary stimulus driving respiration during respiratory acidosis is not actually an increase in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ but probably the ensuing pH decrease within brain tissue. Most evidence indicates that the central chemoreceptors are at a site within the brain parenchyma that responds to changes both in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pH .

Starting from normal blood-gas parameters, an increase in the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ from 40 to $\sim 45 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Hg}$ (an increase of only $\sim 12.5 \%$ ) doubles ventilation. By contrast, hypoxia doubles ventilation only if $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls by $\sim 50 \%$. If $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increases suddenly, the increase in ventilation begins rapidly, augmenting first the depth and later the frequency of inspirations. However, the response may take as long as 10 minutes to develop fully (Fig. 32-12A). If, instead, the acid-base disturbance in arterial blood is a metabolic acidosis of comparable magnitude (i.e., a decrease in $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{o}}$ and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{i}$, at a fixed $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$; see p. 635), ventilation increases much more slowly and the steady-state increase is substantially less.

The reason for these observations is that the central chemoreceptors are located within the brain parenchyma (see Fig. 32-12B) and are bathed in brain extracellular fluid (BECF), which is separated from arterial blood by the blood-
brain barrier (BBB). The BBB has a high permeability to small neutral molecules such as $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ but a low permeability to ions such as $\mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{Cl}^{-}, \mathrm{H}^{+}$, and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]_{i}$, (see p. 286). An increase in arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ rapidly leads to a $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ increase of similar magnitude in the BECF, in the CSF, and inside brain cells. The result is an acidosis in each of these compartments. In fact, because the protein concentration of CSF or BECF is lower than that of blood plasma (see Table 11-1), the non- $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$buffering power (see p. 629) of CSF and BECF is also substantially less. Thus, at least initially, raising $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ produces a larger signal (i.e., pH decrease) in the CSF and BECF than in the blood. 032-18

Although raising arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes the pH of the BECF and CSF to fall rapidly, the choroid plexus (see pp. 279-282) and perhaps the BBB partially restore the pH of these compartments by actively transporting $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$from the blood into the CSF. Thus, after many hours or days of respiratory acidosis in the arterial blood, the low- pH signal in the BECF and CSF gradually wanes. Even so, respiratory acid-base disturbances lead to substantial changes in the steady-state pH of the BECF and CSF (see Fig. 32-12C, purple curve).

In contrast to its high $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ permeability, the BBB's permeability to ions such as $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$is low. For this reason, and because the BBB actively regulates the pH of the BECF and CSF, metabolic acid-base disturbances alter steady-state brain pH only $10 \%$ to $35 \%$ as much as identical blood pH changes during respiratory acid-base disturbances (see Fig. 32-12C, red curve). Therefore, ventilation is much less sensitive to changes in arterial pH and $\left[\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right]$at constant arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Ventilation correlates uniquely with the pH of the BECF (see Fig. 32-12D), regardless of whether respiratory or metabolic acid-base disturbances produce the pH changes.

## Central chemoreceptors are located in the ventrolateral medulla and other brainstem regions

Early work on central chemoreceptors by Hans Loeschcke, Marianne Schläfke, and Robert Mitchell identified candidate regions near the surface of the ventrolateral medulla (VLM; Fig. 32-13A). The application of acidic solutions to the rostral or caudal VLM leads to a prompt increase in ventilation. Moreover, focal cooling of these areas to $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to reversibly inhibit neurons-or placement of lesions to permanently destroy the neurons-blunts the ventilatory response to respiratory acidosis. This and other work led to the conclusion that the central chemoreceptors are located near the surface of the VLM.

More recent work with brain slices and cultured cells show that acidosis stimulates neurons in many brainstem nuclei, including the medullary raphé (see Fig. 32-13A, inset) and the NTS-both in the medulla-as well as the locus coeruleus and hypothalamus. Experiments in the laboratory of Eugene Nattie show that focal acidosis within many of these areas stimulates breathing in intact animals. (4) N32-19 It is not clear how important each of these chemosensitive areas is in the control of ventilation under normal conditions. One possibility is that multiple sensors are another example of redundancy in a critical system. Alternatively, some may come into play only under special circumstances, such as during severe acid-base disturbances or during sleep, when airway obstruction leads to arousal.

## N32-18 $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-Induced pH Changes in CSF and Brain Extracellular Fluid

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

As noted in the text, because the CSF and BECF have a lower protein content than either blood plasma or whole blood, the buffering power of the CSF and BECF is much lower than that of blood. Thus, increases in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$-initially at least-cause larger pH decreases in the CSF and BECF than in blood. Over time, as summarized on page 713, the choroid plexus and perhaps the BBB itself increase the active transport of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ into the CSF and BECF. This transport represents a metabolic compensation to respiratory acidosis (see p. 641). During this compensation, the pH values of the CSF and BECF gradually rise, and thus the size of the net $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-induced acidification gradually becomes smaller.

## N32-19 Central Chemoreceptor

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

If the BBB is so permeable to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$-and if the pH change in the BECF is so large and so fast-why does it take 5 to 10 minutes to produce a maximal ventilatory response to hypercapnia? The delay may be due to (1) a slower change in pH at the actual (i.e., unknown) location of chemosensation, (2) a delay in the chemotransduction events, or (3) a delay in the response of the CPG or respiratory motor neurons to input from the central chemoreceptor neurons.

More recent studies on brain slices and cultured cells show that acidosis stimulates neurons in many brainstem nuclei. These include the VLM discussed in the text, the medullary raphé (see Fig. 32-13B), the nucleus ambiguus, and the NTS-all in the medulla-as well as the locus coeruleus and the hypothalamus. Experiments in the laboratory of Eugene Nattie have provided evidence that at least some of these acidosis-stimulated neurons are in fact respiratory chemoreceptors. In intact animals, microinjecting acetazolamide into these regions increases ventilation. Acetazolamide blocks carbonic anhydrase, the enzyme that catalyzes the hydration of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ to $\mathrm{H}^{+}$and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-} \quad$N18-3 Presumably, this blockade produces a localized region of acidosis that activates nearby chemosensitive neurons. Indeed, the effects of acetazolamide microinjections suggest that chemosensitive areas include the VLM, medullary raphé, the nucleus ambiguus, the NTS, and the locus coeruleus.

It remains unclear how important the aforementioned regions are to normal respiratory chemoreception. If they all are central chemoreceptors, then these multiple sensors may be another example of redundancy in a critical system. Alternatively, instead of all being involved in the response to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ under normal conditions in adults, some of these neurons may come into play only under special circumstances, such as during severe acid-base disturbances, when one is asleep, or during a particular time in the development of an infant.

## Some neurons of the medullary raphé and VLM are unusually pH sensitive

Certain medullary raphé neurons are unusually pH sensitive. In brain slices and in tissue culture, small decreases in extracellular pH raise the firing rate of one subset of medullary raphé neurons (see Fig. 32-13B) and lower the firing rate of another. N32-20 In both types of chemosensitive neurons, metabolic and respiratory disturbances have similar effects on firing, which indicates that the primary stimulus is a decrease in either extracellular or intracellular pH , rather than an increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$.

The two types of chemosensitive neurons have other distinguishing properties, including different shapes, basal firing patterns, and neurotransmitter content. For example, the neurons stimulated by acidosis contain the neurotransmitter serotonin, which induces pacemaker activity in preBötC neurons (see p. 707). These serotonergic neurons are also known to stimulate breathing in vivo. Serotonergic neurons are also present in the VLM. Those that are inhibited by acidosis may contain the inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). When arterial
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ rises, acidosis-stimulated neurons may stimulate breathing as an accelerator does on a car, whereas acidosis-inhibited neurons may decrease the inhibition of breathing, as when one is letting off on the brake (see Fig. 32-13C).

The serotonergic neurons in the medullary raphé are located in close apposition to large branches of the basilar artery (see Fig. 32-13D), so that-like the glomus cells of the peripheral chemoreceptors-they can sense arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ with fidelity. Thus, serotonergic neurons of the raphé and VLM have many properties that would be expected of central respiratory chemoreceptors. Many infants who have died of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) have a deficit of serotonergic neurons, which is consistent with a prevailing theory that a subset of SIDS infants have a defect in central respiratory chemoreception.

A second proposed set of central chemoreceptor neurons is located in a part of the rostral VLM called the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN). (○) N32-22 These neurons express the transcription factor Phox2b (see p. 340), mutations in which occur in the majority of cases of Ondine's curse (see Box 32-5).

## N32-21 Sudden Infant Death Syndrome

## Contributed by George Richerson

SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant younger than 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a complete clinical review, autopsy, and death-scene investigation. SIDS is the leading cause of postneonatal infant death in developed countries, causing six deaths each day in the United States alone. SIDS usually occurs during sleep in infants that were previously thought to be healthy. The consensus is that the majority of SIDS cases are due to abnormalities of breathing and arousal in response to high $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ or low $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. When a vulnerable infant is exposed to an exogenous stressor-such as covering of the mouth by a blanket-it is unable to respond appropriately. Consistent with this explanation, the incidence of SIDS has decreased by $50 \%$ since the recommendation was made for mothers to put babies to sleep on their backs (the "Back to Sleep" campaign). Although the pathophysiology of SIDS remains unknown, recent work has revealed a number of abnormalities of serotonin neurons in the medulla (Paterson et al, 2006) that may cause an infant to be vulnerable. These abnormalities seem to involve a delay in maturation of these neurons due to environmental or genetic factors. Because serotonin neurons are central respiratory chemoreceptors (Richerson, 2004) and are also involved in cardiovascular and thermoregulatory control, as well as regulation of sleep and arousal, a delay in their normal maturation could explain SIDS. Ongoing work is now aimed at identifying those infants with serotonin-neuron defects before they die and finding a treatment to prevent SIDS in those infants.

## N32-22 Neurons in the Retrotrapezoid Nucleus

## Contributed by George Richerson

As discussed in the main text, central respiratory chemoreceptor neurons are present in several locations in the brain. One of these areas appears to be the RTN, located in the rostral VLM.

Properties of these neurons include the following:

- The RTN contains serotonergic neurons as well as glutamatergic neurons. Both are candidates for central chemoreceptors.
- These neurons might be intrinsically pH sensitive, or may be stimulated by serotonergic neurons or by astrocytes that release ATP in response to respiratory acidosis.
- The glutamatergic neurons in this region project to the preBötC and other respiratory nuclei.
- These neurons stimulate the respiratory network.
- These neurons respond to respiratory acidosis with an increase in firing rate in brain slices and in vivo.
- These neurons express the transcription factor Phox2b (see Box 14-1). Mutations in Phox2b occur in the majority of cases of Ondine's curse (see Box 32-5).

## INTEGRATED RESPONSES TO HYPOXIA, HYPERCAPNIA, AND ACIDOSIS

In real life, it is rare for arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ to fall without accompanying changes in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ and pH . In addition, changes in individual blood-gas parameters may independently affect both the peripheral and the central chemoreceptors. How does the respiratory system as a whole respond to changes in multiple blood-gas parameters?

## Hypoxia accentuates the acute response to respiratory acidosis

Respiratory Acidosis When the blood-gas parameters are nearly normal, respiratory acidosis (increased $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}} /$ decreased pH ) stimulates ventilation more than does hypoxia. If an animal breathes an air mixture containing $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, the resultant respiratory acidosis causes ventilation to increase rapidly. Because both peripheral and central chemoreceptors respond to respiratory acidosis, both could contribute to the response. It is possible to isolate the function of the two sets of chemoreceptors by (1) denervating the peripheral chemoreceptors to study the response of the central chemoreceptors alone, or (2) perfusing the carotid bodies to study the response of the peripheral chemoreceptors alone. On the basis of approaches such as these, it appears that the central chemoreceptors account for $65 \%$ to $80 \%$ of the integrated response to respiratory acidosis under normoxic conditions. However, the response of the peripheral chemoreceptors is considerably more rapid than that of the central chemoreceptors, which require several minutes to develop a maximal response.

At an alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ that is somewhat higher than normal, raising the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ causes a linear increase in steadystate ventilation (Fig. 32-14A, red curve). Lowering the alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ has two effects (see Fig. 32-14A, other two curves). First, at a given $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, hypoxia increases ventilation, which reflects the response of the peripheral chemoreceptors to hypoxia. Second, hypoxia increases the sensitivity of the integrated response to respiratory acidosis. That is, the slopes of the curves increase. At least part of the explanation for this increase in slopes is that the peripheral chemoreceptor itself-as judged by the activity of the carotid sinus nervebecomes more sensitive to respiratory acidosis with coexisting hypoxia.

Metabolic Acidosis Severe metabolic acidosis (e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis) leads to profound hyperventilation, known as Kussmaul breathing (see Box 32-2). This hyperventilation can drive arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ down to low levels in an attempt to compensate for the metabolic acidosis. Acutely, the main stimulus for hyperventilation comes from peripheral chemoreceptors. Because a severe decrease in arterial pH does produce a small fall in CSF pH , central chemoreceptors also participate in this response. If the insult persists for many hours, CSF pH falls even farther, and central chemoreceptor drive becomes more prominent (Box 32-3).

## Respiratory acidosis accentuates the acute response to hypoxia

If an animal breathes an $\mathrm{O}_{2}$-deficient gas mixture, the resulting hypoxia causes ventilation to increase rapidly. As already discussed, the peripheral chemoreceptors respond primarily

## BOX 32-3 Chronic Hypercapnia in Pulmonary Disease

Chronic hypercapnia occurs in many people with diseases that affect the lungs (e.g., emphysema-destruction of alveoli and loss of proper gas exchange) or respiratory muscles (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neuropathies, and myopathies). An increase in $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ leads to an immediate respiratory acidosis in the arterial blood and brain. If $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ remains elevated, the pH of the CSF/BECF slowly recovers (i.e., increases) over the following 8 to 24 hours. The mechanism of this $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{CSF}}$ increase is probably an increase in $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$flux into the CSF/BECF across the choroid plexus (see Fig. 11-4) and BBB, representing a metabolic compensation to the respiratory acidosis (see p. 633). The increased CSF pH shifts the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ response curves in Figure 32-14A to the right because, compared with reference conditions, a higher $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ is needed to produce a given degree of CSF acidity (i.e., ventilatory drive). Such a resetting of the central chemoreceptors may be important clinically for patients who chronically retain $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$. Even though $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ may be quite high, adaptation of the CSF/ BECF restores $\mathrm{pH}_{\mathrm{CSF}}$ toward normal. With central chemoreceptor drive for ventilation now decreased, the main drive for ventilation may become hypoxia via peripheral chemoreceptors. Administration of supplemental $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ to such a patient may remove the hypoxic drive as well, causing ventilation to decrease and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ to rise to very high levels (e.g., $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}>$ 100 mm Hg ). At such high levels, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ acts like a narcotic. This " $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ narcosis" then directly inhibits ventilation and can cause death from hypoventilation-a classic example of "too much of a good thing."
to hypoxia. To what extent do central mechanisms contribute to the integrated response to acute hypoxia? In an animal with denervated peripheral chemoreceptors, hypoxia actually depresses respiratory output. Thus, the integrated response actually underestimates the stimulatory contribution of the peripheral chemoreceptors.

At an arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ that is slightly lower than normal, lowering alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ has very little effect on ventilation until $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ falls below 50 mm Hg (see Fig. 32-14B, red curve). The eventual response at very low $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$ values indicates that the peripheral chemoreceptors play a vital, fail-safe role in responding to extreme hypoxia, as at high altitudes (see p. 1231). Raising the arterial $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ (i.e., respiratory acidosis) has two effects (see Fig. 32-14B, other two curves). First, at a given $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$, respiratory acidosis increases ventilation, which reflects the dual contributions of the peripheral and central chemoreceptors to hypercapnia and acidosis. Second, respiratory acidosis increases the sensitivity of the integrated response to hypoxia. That is, the curves become steeper. These effects on the integrated response (see Fig. 32-14B) are similar to-although more exaggerated than-the effects of respiratory acidosis on the response of the peripheral chemoreceptor to hypoxia (see Fig. 32-9B).

## MODULATION OF VENTILATORY CONTROL

The major parameters that feed back on the respiratory control system are the arterial blood-gas parameters $-\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}$,
$\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH . In addition, the respiratory system receives input from two other major sources: (1) a variety of stretch and chemical/irritant receptors that monitor the size of the airways and the presence of noxious agents, and (2) higher CNS centers that modulate respiration during nonrespiratory activities.

## Stretch and chemical/irritant receptors in the airways and lung parenchyma provide feedback about lung volume and the presence of irritants

Sensors within the lungs and upper airways detect foreign bodies, chemical irritants, or immunological challenges and help protect the lungs-one of the few organs that have direct access to the outside world. Sensors also detect changes in lung volume as part of a feedback mechanism that helps control output to respiratory muscles. Respiratory afferent fibers from sensors in the thorax travel with CN X, and those from sensors in the upper airways travel with CN IX. Both synapse within the DRG in the medulla (see p. 705).

Slowly Adapting Pulmonary Stretch Receptors Mechanoreceptors within the tracheobronchial tree detect changes in lung volume by sensing stretch of the airway walls. One type of pulmonary stretch receptor (PSR), the slowly adapting PSR, N32-23 responds to stretch with an increase in firing that then decays very slowly over time. One of the functions of these receptors may be to inform the brain about lung volume to optimize respiratory output.

A reflex that involves slowly adapting PSRs is the Hering-Breuer reflex, one of the first examples in physiology of negative feedback. In 1868, Hering and Breuer found that lung inflation inhibits the output of phrenic motor neurons (Fig. 32-15), which protects the lungs from overinflation. Because the reflex also increases respiratory frequency, it maintains a constant alveolar ventilation. This reflex may be important in controlling tidal volume during eupnea in human infants. In adults, this reflex does not occur until lung volume is greater than during a normal inspiration. However, the sensor may provide feedback that the medulla uses to choose a combination of tidal volume and respiratory frequency that minimizes the work of breathing.

Rapidly Adapting Pulmonary Stretch (Irritant) Receptors The rapidly adapting PSRs ( $\mathbf{\text { N32-24 }}$ respond to a sudden, maintained inflation with a rapid increase in firing rate, which then decreases by $80 \%$ or more within 1 second. Unlike slowly adapting PSRs, rapidly adapting PSRs are very sensitive to a variety of chemical stimuli, hence the term irritant receptors. These stimuli include serotonin, prostaglandins, bradykinin, ammonia, cigarette smoke, and ether. An important function of these receptors may be to detect pathophysiological processes in the airway, such as chemical irritation, congestion, and inflammation. These receptors also detect histamine (see p. 620 and Fig. 13-8B), which produces bronchoconstriction in asthma.

C-Fiber Receptors A rich network of small, unmyelinated axons (C fibers; see p. 302) have nerve endingsjuxtacapillary or J receptors-in alveoli and conducting

## N32-23 Slowly Adapting PSRs

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

Within the tracheobronchial tree are mechanoreceptors that detect changes in lung volume by sensing stretch of the airway walls. These are PSRs. One type of PSR responds to stretch with a sudden increase in firing that then decays (i.e., "adapts") very slowly over time. These slowly adapting PSRs are located from the extrathoracic trachea down through the intrapulmonary bronchi; their afferent axons are myelinated. Except for hypocapnia, chemical stimuli do not selectively excite these receptors, whose function may be partly to inform the brain about lung volume to optimize respiratory output.

## N32-24 Rapidly Adapting PSRs

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

In addition to the slowly adapting PSRs discussed in (1) N32-23, the lung has PSRs that respond to inflation at a higher volume. A sudden, maintained inflation causes their firing rate to increase suddenly and then to decrease (i.e., "adapt") within 1 second to $20 \%$ or less of the initial rate. Rapid deflation also stimulates them. The distribution of these receptors is not as well characterized as that of the slowly adapting PSRs, but they seem to be located throughout the tracheobronchial tree. Their afferent axons are myelinated.

Unlike the slowly adapting PSRs, the rapidly adapting PSRs are also very sensitive to a variety of chemical stimuli, hence the term irritant receptors. These stimuli include histamine, serotonin, prostaglandins, bradykinin, ammonia, cigarette smoke, and ether. In some cases, the chemical directly stimulates the receptor. In others, the chemical first triggers a bronchoconstriction, and this volume change then activates the stretch receptor. An important function of these receptors may be to detect pathophysiological processes in the airway, such as chemical irritation, congestion, and inflammation. The response to histamine produces bronchoconstriction in asthma.

airways. Like slowly adapting PSRs, which are extensions of myelinated axons, these C -fiber receptors respond to both chemical and mechanical stimuli. Stimulation of C -fiber receptors elicits a triad of rapid and shallow breathing, bronchoconstriction, and increased secretion of mucus into airways-all of which may be defense mechanisms. Bronchoconstriction and rapid, shallow breathing enhance turbulence (see p. 617), which favors the deposition of foreign substances in mucus higher up in the bronchial tree, where mucus-secreting cells are located (Box 32-4).

Figure 32-15 Hering-Breuer reflex. In a paralyzed and artificially ventilated animal, prevention of lung inflation during inspiratory activity (blue curves) leads to prolonged phrenic nerve output (i.e., if the animal were not paralyzed, then tidal volume would be large). Inflation of the lungs during inspiratory activity (red curves) produces feedback that shortens the duration of inspiratory activity (i.e., if the animal were not paralyzed, then the tidal volume would be smaller) and also causes the next breath to occur earlier (respiratory frequency would increase). (Data from von Euler C: Brainstem mechanisms for generation and control of breathing pattern. In Cherniack NS, Widdicombe J [eds]: Handbook of Physiology, Section 3: The Respiratory System, vol 2, part 1. Bethesda, MD, American Physiological Society, 1986, pp 1-67).

## Higher brain centers coordinate ventilation with other behaviors and can override the brainstem's control of breathing

The role of the CNS in controlling ventilation is far more complex than generating a regular pattern of inspirations and expirations, and then modifying this pattern in response to input from mechanical and chemical sensors. The CNS also must balance the need to control $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{O}_{2}}, \mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$, and pH with the need to control ventilation for nonrespiratory purposes, such as speaking, sniffing, and regulating temperature (e.g., panting in dogs). In addition, the CNS must coordinate breathing with behaviors that require the absence of airflow, such as chewing, swallowing, and vomiting.

Many nonrespiratory regions of the CNS tonically stimulate or inhibit respiration. For example, the reticular activating system (see p. 270) in the brainstem is one of the sources of tonic drive to the respiratory CPG. An increase in this drive occurs during arousal from sleep, when a general alerting reaction increases ventilation and heart rate and activates the brain as evidenced on an electroencephalogram.

Coordination with Voluntary Behaviors That Use Respiratory Muscles Numerous voluntary actions initiated in the cerebral cortex involve a change in airflow-voluntarily hyperventilating, breath holding, speaking, singing, whistling, and playing musical wind instruments. Although voluntary control over muscles of respiration can be exquisitely precise, this control is not absolute. For example, voluntary breath holding can last only so long before being overwhelmed by ventilatory drive from chemoreceptors. The cerebral cortex controls the respiratory system by at least two major mechanisms. First, some cortical neurons send axons to respiratory centers in the medulla. Second, some cortical premotor neurons send axons to motor neurons that control muscles of respiration. One consequence of this dual control mechanism is that lesions in specific areas of the cerebral cortex can abolish voluntary breath holding, a condition known as respiratory apraxia. Another consequence is that small CNS lesions may specifically knock out one set of connections. For example, patients with intractable pain are sometimes treated with partial transection of the upper cervical ventrolateral spinal cord to cut axons carrying pain sensation to the thalamus (spinothalamic tract). When this procedure inadvertently damages respiratory projections within the reticulospinal tract, patients breathe properly while awake but experience respiratory failure while asleepOndine's curse (Box 32-5). The lesion may cut automatic premotor neurons descending to the spinal cord from

# BOX 32-4 Sighs, Yawns, Coughs, and Sneezes 

The respiratory apparatus engages in a variety of motor behaviors that help maintain normal lung function and gas exchange by protecting the alveoli from collapse or preventing obstruction of the upper airways.

Sigh or "Augmented Breath" A sigh is a slow and deep inspiration, held for just a moment, followed by a longer-than-
normal expiratory period (see Fig. 32-3). A normal person sighs -6 times per hour. Local collapse of alveoli latelectasis) may initiate a sigh, which is an important mechanism for stimulating release of surfactant (see pp. 613-614) and thus reopening these alveoli. Hypoxia and respiratory acidosis increase sigh frequency, consistent with the idea that sighs counteract decreased alveolar ventilation.

# BOX 32-4 Sighs, Yawns, Coughs, and Sneezes-cont'd 

Yawn An exaggerated sigh, a yawn takes lung volume to total lung capacity for several seconds. The mouth is fully open. In the extreme case, the arms are stretched upward, the neck is extended to elevate the pectoral girdle, and the back is extendedmaneuvers that maximize lung volume (see p. 602). Yawning is even more effective than sighing in opening up the most resistant atelectatic alveoli. Everyone "knows" that yawns are contagious, and some evidence suggests that this is actually true. Yawns may (1) minimize atelectasis as one prepares for sleep (as during a boring lecture), and (2) reverse-on arousal-the atelectasis that has accumulated during sleep. Interestingly, many trained athletes yawn just before a big event, presumably preparing the lungs for enhanced gas exchange.

Cough Reflex Coughing is important for ridding the tracheobronchial tree of inhaled foreign substances. There is probably no single class of "cough receptors." (C) N32-25 The tickling sensation that is relieved by a cough is analogous to the cutaneous itch and is probably mediated by C-fiber receptors. Thus, a cough is a respiratory scratch.

When lower airway receptors trigger a cough, it begins with a small inspiration that increases the coughing force. Mechanosensitive and irritant receptors in the larynx can trigger either coughing or apnea. When they trigger a cough, the inspiration is absent, which minimizes the chances that the offending foreign body will be pulled deeper into the lungs. In either case, a forced expiratory effort against a closed glottis raises intrathoracic and intra-abdominal pressures to very high levels. The glottis then opens suddenly, and the pressure inside the larynx falls almost instantaneously to near-atmospheric levels. This
sudden drop in luminal pressure produces dramatic increases in the axial (alveolus to trachea) pressure gradient that drives air low (see pp. 616-617). In the trachea, this pressure drop also decreases the radial transmural pressure difference across the tracheal wall, thereby collapsing the trachea (see p. 626), especially the membranous (i.e., noncartilaginous) part of the trachea. As a result, tracheal cross-sectional area may fall to as little as one sixth of its original value. The net effect is a brief but violent rush of air out of the trachea at velocities near $800 \mathrm{~km} / \mathrm{hr}$ ( $-65 \%$ of the speed of sound) that loosens mucus or foreign bodies and moves them upward. Protracted bouts of severe coughing can lead to lightheadedness or even syncope because the high intrathoracic pressure decreases venous return and reduces cardiac output (see pp. 548-551). N32-26

Sneeze Sensors in the nose detect irritants and can evoke a sneeze. Curiously, these same receptors are probably also responsible for apnea in response to water applied to the face or nose, which is part of the diving reflex that evolved in diving mammals such as the seal to prevent aspiration during submersion. A sneeze differs from a cough in that a sneeze is almost always preceded by a deep inspiration. Like a cough, a sneeze involves an initial buildup of intrathoracic pressure behind a closed glottis. Unlike a cough, a sneeze involves pharyngeal constriction during the buildup phase and an explosive forced expiration through the nose as well as the mouth. This expiration is accompanied by contraction of facial and nasal muscles, so that the effect is to dislodge foreign bodies from the nasal mucosa.

## BOX 32-5 Ondine's Curse, Sleep, and Sleep Apnea

Ondine's Curse Ondine, a water nymph in a German legend, was immortalized in the 1811 fairy tale by Friedrich Heinrich Karl, Baron de la Motte-Fouqué. In the play Ondine by Jean Giraudoux in 1939, Ondine married a mortal man, Hans, with the understanding that Hans would never marry a mortal woman. However, when Ondine later returned to the sea, her husband did remarry. Ondine's father punished Hans by requiring him to make a continuous conscious effort to maintain lung ventilation (and all other automatic body functions). If he fell asleep, he would stop breathing and die. Hans explained to Ondine how hard it is to live with his curse: "One moment of inattention and I shall forget to hear, to breathe. They will say he died because breathing bored him." Some patients have the same disorder-minus the relationship with a water nymph. The majority of these patients have congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) due to mutations in PHOX2B (see p. 340), which encodes a transcription factor required for development of the autonomic nervous system and a limited number of other neurons, including a subset in the RTN (see p. 714). These patients can be treated by providing mechanical ventilation when they sleep; they can maintain normal ventilation on their own while awake.

Sleep Sleep, or even closing one's eyes, has powerful effects on the breathing pattern and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ responsiveness. During
non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, the regularity of eupneic breathing increases; also, the sensitivity of the respiratory system to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decreases compared with wakefulness, and the outflow to the muscles of the pharynx decreases. During rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the pattern of breathing becomes markedly irregular, sometimes with no discernible rhythm, and the sensitivity of the respiratory system to $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ decreases further. Thus, $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ often increases during NREM sleep, and usually even more so during REM sleep. Barbiturates at low doses depress drive to the respiratory system and, if superimposed on normal sleep, can halt ventilation altogether.

Sleep Apnea The collection of disorders in which ventilation ceases during deeper stages of sleep, particularly during REM sleep, is known as sleep apnea. Some cases of sleep apnea are related to Ondine's curse and are due to a lack of central drivecentral sleep apnea. However, most cases are due to collapse of the airway with sleep-obstructive sleep apnea-usually in obese people. The airway collapse is due to an exaggeration of the normal decrease in airway tone during sleep, superimposed on the structural problem of reduced airway diameter due to obesity. This is a common disorder associated with severe and excessive snoring, poor and interrupted sleep, daytime somnolence, and behavioral changes, possibly leading ultimately to hypertension and cardiac arrhythmias.

## N32-25 C Fibers

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

A rich network of extremely thin, unmyelinated axons-C fibers-innervates receptors in the alveoli and conducting airways. Like the slowly adapting PSRs, N32-23 which are innervated by myelinated nerve fibers, C-fiber receptors respond to both chemical and mechanical stimuli. Alveolar C-fiber receptors become active very soon (i.e., 1 to 2 seconds) after the injection of certain chemicals into the blood of the right atrium of the heart,* which suggests that the receptors may be very near pulmonary capillaries. Hence the name juxtacapillary or J receptors. The J receptors respond "chemically" to inflammatory agents released in the airway wall: histamine, serotonin, bradykinin, and prostaglandins. They also respond to mechanical stimuli, including lung or vascular congestion.

The C-fiber receptors in conducting airways are less sensitive to lung inflation than their alveolar counterparts, but are more sensitive to chemical mediators of inflammation. Stimulating C-fiber receptors elicits a triad of rapid and shallow breathing, bronchoconstriction, and increased secretion of mucus into airways-all of which may be defense mechanisms. Bronchoconstriction and rapid, shallow breathing would enhance turbulence (see Fig. 27-12C), favoring the deposition of foreign substances in mucus higher up in the bronchial tree, where mucus-secreting cells are located.

The afferent nerve fibers for all sensors located in the tracheobronchial tree and lung parenchyma travel to the medulla in the vagus nerve (CN X) via either myelinated or unmyelinated fibers. The myelinated fibers rapidly transmit impulses from PSRs and are readily blocked by cooling ( $-8^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ to $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ). Unmyelinated nerve fibers-the C fibers discussed above-slowly transmit impulses from J receptors near alveoli, as well as other receptors in conducting airways, and conduct impulses even at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. This differential temperature sensitivity is a useful tool for studying respiratory reflexes. For a discussion of the effects of myelination and axon diameter on axon conduction velocity, see the passage in the text that begins on page 302 .

## N32-26 External Compression of Thoracic Vessels

## Contributed by George Richerson, Emile Boulpaep, and Walter Boron

The example of severe coughing leading to syncope is a special case in which the external compression of the vessels in the thorax causes an increase in their resistance and thus a decrease in venous return. Keep in mind that not only does the inferior vena cava have a rather low pressure, but all pulmonary vessels (i.e., arteries, capillaries, and veins) also have a low pressure. Thus, all of these vessels are particularly susceptible to collapse by an increase in the surrounding pressure.

respiratory centers in the medulla, but not voluntary ones from the cortex.

Coordination with Complex Nonventilatory Behaviors One of the jobs of the brain is to coordinate complex behaviors such as yawning, chewing, swallowing, sucking, defecating, grunting, and vomiting. During yawning and vomiting, for example, groups of neurons orchestrate an array of simultaneous actions, only some involving the respiratory system. The premotor neurons that project from medullary respiratory centers to respiratory motor neurons are probably distinct from descending pathways involved in these complex nonventilatory behaviors.

Modification by Affective States Fear, horror, rage, and passion can be associated with major and highly characteristic changes in the respiratory pattern. For example, if a child runs in front of the car you are driving, the sudden application of the brakes is almost always accompanied by an equally sudden and rapid inspiration, with mouth open widely, increasing lung volume to nearly total lung capacity. The tendency of prevarications to be associated with changes in the breathing pattern is the basis for one part of the polygraph test used as a lie detector. Descending pathways from the limbic system (see p. 349) of the forebrain may mediate these emotional effects on breathing.

Balancing Conflicting Demands of Gas Exchange and Other Behaviors Ventilation, or lack thereof, is involved in a
wide variety of behaviors, many of which have nothing to do with alveolar gas exchange per se. How is it that the brain is able to weigh the need for alveolar gas exchange against these competing demands on the respiratory system? Playing a musical wind instrument is an example of a situation in which respiratory and nonrespiratory needs are reconciled. Musicians must make rapid and deep inspirations, followed by slow and prolonged expirations that can lead to considerable breath-to-breath variations in alveolar $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$. Nevertheless, these variations balance out, so that professionals can follow a musical score for prolonged periods without significant changes in average alveolar ventilation.

In other cases, conflicting demands are not so easily resolved. In infants, suckling relegates alveolar ventilation to a lower priority, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ rises. Subjects reading aloud tend to increase their alveolar ventilation by $\sim 25 \%$, and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{CO}_{2}}$ falls. Thus, during speech, chemical drive is overwhelmed by voluntary behavior. On the other hand, when strenuous exercise increases the need for alveolar ventilation, the CNS permits only brief gasps for speech-the ability of voluntary behavior to subvert body homeostasis can go only so far.

# ORGANIZATION OF THE URINARY SYSTEM 

Gerhard Giebisch, Erich E. Windhager, and Peter S. Aronson

The kidneys serve three essential functions. First, they act as filters, removing metabolic products and toxins from the blood and excreting them through the urine. Second, they regulate the body's fluid status, electrolyte balance, and acidbase balance. Third, the kidneys produce or activate hormones that are involved in erythrogenesis, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ metabolism, and the regulation of blood pressure and blood flow.

## FUNCTIONAL ANATOMY OF THE KIDNEY

We begin this discussion with a macroscopic view and progress to the microscopic level as we describe the nephron, the functional unit of the kidney that is repeated approximately 1 million times within each kidney.

## The kidneys are paired, retroperitoneal organs with vascular and epithelial elements

The human kidneys are paired, bean-shaped structures that lie behind the peritoneum on each side of the vertebral column (Fig. 33-1A). They extend from the twelfth thoracic vertebra to the third lumbar vertebra. The two kidneys together comprise somewhat less than $0.5 \%$ of the total body weight; in men, each kidney weighs 125 to 170 g , whereas in women, each kidney weighs 115 to 155 g .

A fibrous, almost nondistensible capsule covers each kidney (see Fig. 33-1B). In the middle of the concave surface, a slit in the capsule-the hilus-serves as the port of entry for the renal artery and nerves and as the site of exit for the renal vein, the lymphatics, and the ureter. The hilus opens into a shallow space called the renal sinus, which is completely surrounded by renal parenchyma except where it connects with the upper end of the ureter. The renal sinus includes the urine-filled spaces: the renal pelvis proper and its extensions, the major and the minor calyces. Blood vessels and nerves also pass through the sinus. The renal capsule reflects into the sinus at the hilus so that its inner layers line the sinus, and the outer layers anchor to the blood vessels and renal pelvis.

A section of the kidney (see Fig. 33-1B) reveals two basic layers, the cortex (granular outer region) and the medulla (darker inner region). The granularity of the cortex results from the presence of glomeruli, microscopic tufts of capillaries, and a large number of highly convoluted epithelial structures in the form of tubules. The medulla lacks
glomeruli and consists of a parallel arrangement of tubules and small blood vessels.

The medulla is subdivided into 8 to 18 conical renal pyramids, whose bases face the cortical-medullary border; the tip of each pyramid terminates in the renal pelvis. At the tip of each pyramid are perforations, almost invisible to the naked eye, through which urine flows into the minor calyces of the renal sinus.

## The kidneys have a very high blood flow and glomerular capillaries flanked by afferent and efferent arterioles

Although the kidneys comprise $<0.5 \%$ of total body weight, they receive $\sim 20 \%$ of the cardiac output. This high blood flow provides the blood plasma necessary for forming an ultrafiltrate in the glomeruli. The renal circulation has a unique sequence of vascular elements: a high-resistance arteriole (the efferent arteriole), followed by a high-pressure glomerular capillary network for filtration, followed by a second high-resistance arteriole (the afferent arteriole), followed by a low-pressure capillary network that surrounds the renal tubules (peritubular capillaries) and takes up the fluid absorbed by these tubules.

The main features of the renal vascular system are illustrated in Figure 33-1B and C. A single renal artery enters the hilus and divides into anterior and posterior branches, which give rise to interlobar and then arcuate arteries. The latter arteries skirt the corticomedullary junction, where they branch into ascending interlobular arteries that enter the cortex and give rise to numerous afferent arterioles. These give rise to glomerular capillaries that rejoin to form efferent arterioles. For nephrons in the superficial portion of the cortex, the efferent arterioles are the origin of a dense peritubular capillary network that supplies oxygen and nutrients to the tubules in the cortex. The afferent and efferent arterioles determine the hydrostatic pressure in the interposed glomerular capillaries. The tone of both arterioles is under the control of a rich sympathetic innervation, as well as a wide variety of chemical mediators.

Very small branches of the arcuate artery, or the proximal portion of the interlobular artery, supply a subpopulation of "juxtamedullary" glomeruli that are located at or near the junction of cortex and medulla. The efferent arterioles of these nephrons descend into the renal papillae to form hairpin-shaped vessels called the vasa recta, which provide
