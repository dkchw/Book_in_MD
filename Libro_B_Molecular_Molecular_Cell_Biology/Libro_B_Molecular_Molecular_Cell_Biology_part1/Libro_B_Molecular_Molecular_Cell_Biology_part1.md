#### Abstract

ABOUT THE COVER: Imaging of the intracellular organelles of a live human HeLa cell shows the dramatic morphological changes that accompany the process of cell division. The membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is labeled green by a fluorescently tagged component of the translocon (GFP$\operatorname{Sec} 61 \beta$ ) and chromatin is labeled red by a fluorescently tagged histone (H2BmRFP). Front: An interphase cell showing uncondensed chromatin filling the nucleus, with the ER as a reticulum of cisternae surrounding the nucleus and interconnected with lace-like tubules at the cell periphery. Back: Prior to cell division the chromatin condenses to reveal the worm-like structure of individual chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the ER condenses into an array of cisternae surrounding the condensed chromosomes. As cell division proceeds the replicated chromosomes will segregate equally into two daughter cells, nuclear envelopes will form in the daughter cells, and the ER will return to its characteristic reticular organization.

In writing the eighth edition of Molecular Cell Biology, we have incorporated many of the spectacular advances made over the past four years in biomedical science, driven in part by new experimental technologies that have revolutionized many fields. Fast techniques for sequencing DNA, allied with efficient methods to generate and study mutations in model organisms and to map disease-causing mutations in humans, have illuminated a basic understanding of the functions of many cellular components, including hundreds of human genes that affect diseases such as diabetes and cancer.

For example, advances in genomics and bioinformatics have uncovered thousands of novel long noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression, and have generated insights into and potential therapies for many human diseases. Powerful genome editing technologies have led to an unprecedented understanding of gene regulation and function in many types of living organisms. Advances in mass spectrometry and cryoelectron microscopy have enabled dynamic cell processes to be visualized in spectacular detail, providing deep insight into both the structure and the function of biological molecules, post-translational modifications, multiprotein complexes, and organelles. Studies of specific nerve cells in live organisms have been advanced by optogenetic technologies. Advances in stem-cell technology have come from studies of the role of stem cells in plant development and of regeneration in planaria.

Exploring the most current developments in the field is always a priority in writing a new edition, but it is also important to us to communicate the basics of cell biology clearly by stripping away as much extraneous detail as possible to focus attention on the fundamental concepts of cell biology. To this end, in addition to introducing new discoveries and technologies, we have streamlined and reorganized several chapters to clarify processes and concepts for students.

## New Co-Author, Kelsey C. Martin

The new edition of $M C B$ introduces a new member to our author team, leading neuroscience researcher and educator Kelsey C. Martin of the University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Martin is Professor of Biological Chemistry and Psychiatry and interim Dean of the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. Her laboratory uses Aplysia and mouse models to understand the cell and molecular biology of long-term memory formation. Her group has made important contributions to elucidating the molecular and cell biological mechanisms by which experience changes connections between neurons in the brain to store
long-term memories-a process known as synaptic plasticity. Dr. Martin received her undergraduate degree in English and American Language and Literature at Harvard University. After serving as a Peace Corps volunteer in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, she earned an MD and PhD at Yale University. She teaches basic neurobiology to undergraduate, graduate, dental, and medical students.

## Revised, Cutting-Edge Content

The eighth edition of Molecular Cell Biology includes new and improved chapters:

- "Molecules, Cells, and Model Organisms" (Chapter 1) is an improved and expanded introduction to cell biology. It retains the overviews of evolution, molecules, different forms of life, and model organisms used to study cell biology found in previous editions. In this edition, it also includes a survey of eukaryotic organelles, which was previously found in Chapter 9.
- "Culturing and Visualizing Cells" (Chapter 4) has been moved forward (previously Chapter 9) as the techniques used to study cells become ever more important. Light-sheet microscopy, super-resolution microscopy, and two-photon excitation microscopy have been added to bring this chapter up to date.
- All aspects of mitochondrial and chloroplast structure and function have been collected in "Cellular Energetics" (Chapter 12). This chapter now begins with the structure of the mitochondrion, including its endosymbiotic origin and organelle genome (previously in Chapter 6). The chapter now discusses the role of mitochondria-associated membranes (MAMs) and communication between mitochondria and the rest of the cell.
- Cell signaling has been reframed to improve student accessibility. "Signal Transduction and G Protein-Coupled Receptors" (Chapter 15) begins with an overview of the concepts of cell signaling and methods for studying it, followed by examples of G protein-coupled receptors performing multiple roles in different cells. "Signaling Pathways That Control Gene Expression" (Chapter 16) now focuses on gene expression, beginning with a new discussion of Smads. Further examples cover the major signaling pathways that students will encounter in cellular metabolism, protein degradation, and cellular differentiation. Of particular interest is a new section on Wnt and Notch signaling pathways controlling stem-cell differentiation in planaria. The chapter ends by describing how signaling pathways are integrated

FIGURE 4-21 Two-photo excitation microscopy allows deep penetration for intravital imaging. (a) In conventional point-scanning confocal microscopy, absorption of a single photon results in an electron jumping to the excited state. In two-photon excitation, two lower-energy photons arrive almost instantaneously and induce the electron to jump to the excited state. (b) Two-photon microscopy can be used to observe cells up to 1 mm deep within a living animal immobilized on the microscope stage.

to form a cellular response in insulin and glucagon control of glucose metabolism.

- Our new co-author, Kelsey C. Martin, has extensively revised and updated "Cells of the Nervous System" (Chapter 22) to include several new developments in the field. Optogenetics, a technique that uses channelrhodopsins and light to perturb the membrane potential of a cell, can be used in live animals to link neural pathways with behavior. The formation and pruning of neural pathways in the central nervous system is under active investigation, and a new discussion of signals that govern these processes focuses on the cell-cell contacts involved. This discussion leads to an entirely new section on learning and memory, which explores the signals and molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity.


## Increased Clarity, Improved Pedagogy

As experienced teachers of both undergraduate and graduate students, we are always striving to improve student understanding. Being able to visualize a molecule in action can have a profound effect on a student's grasp of the molecular processes within a cell. With this in mind, we have updated many of the molecular models for increased clarity and added models where they can deepen student understanding. From the precise fit required for tRNA charging, to the conservation of ribosome structure, to the dynamic strength of tropomyosin and troponin in muscle contraction, these figures communicate the complex details of molecular structure that cannot be conveyed in schematic diagrams alone. In conjunction with these new models, their schematic icons have been revised to more accurately represent them, allowing students a smooth transition between the molecular details of a structure and its function in the cell.

## Plant Biology Connections

Developments in agriculture, environmental science, and alternative energy production have demonstrated that the molecular cell biology of plants is increasingly relevant to our lives. Understanding photosynthesis and chloroplasts is just the beginning of plant biology. Throughout the text, we have highlighted plant-specific topics, including aspects of cell structure and function that are unique to plants, plant development, and plant biotechnology applications directed toward solving problems in agriculture and medicine.

- Vascular plants have rigid cell walls and use turgor pressure to stand upright and grow (Ch. 11)
- Transgenic plants have been produced that overexpress the vacuolar $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{H}^{+}$antiporter, and can therefore grow successfully in soils containing high salt concentrations (Ch. 11)
- Editing of plant mitochondrial RNA transcripts can convert cytosine residues to uracil residues (Ch. 12)
- Photosynthesis is an important process for synthesizing ATP (Ch. 12)
- Chloroplast DNAs are evolutionarily younger and show less structural diversity than mitochondrial DNAs (Ch. 12)
- Chloroplast transformation has led to engineered plants that are resistant to infections as well as plants that can be used to make protein drugs (Ch. 12)
- In giant green algae such as Nitella, the cytosol flows rapidly due to use of myosin V (Ch. 17)
- Formation of the spindle and cytokinesis have unique features in plants (Ch. 18)
- Meristems are niches for stem cells in plants (Ch. 21)
- A negative feedback loop maintains the size of the shoot apical stem-cell population (Ch. 21)

Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.
-Theodosius Dobzhansky, 1973, essay in American Biology Teacher 35:125-129

Biology is a science fundamentally different from physics or chemistry, which deal with unchanging properties of matter that can be described by mathematical equations. Biological systems, of course, follow the rules of chemistry and physics, but biology is a historical science, as the forms and structures of the living world today are the results of billions of years of evolution. Through evolution, all organisms are related in a family tree extending from primitive single-celled organisms that lived in the distant past to the diverse plants, animals, and microorganisms of the present era (Figure 1-1, Table 1-1). The great insight of Charles Darwin (Figure 1-2) was the principle of natural selection: organisms vary randomly and compete within their environment for resources. Only those that survive and reproduce are able to pass down their genetic traits.

## Molecular, Cells, and Model Organisms

At first glance, the biological universe does appear amazingly diverse-from tiny ferns to tall fir trees, from single-celled bacteria and protozoans visible only under a microscope to multicellular animals of all kinds. Indeed, cells come in an astonishing variety of sizes and shapes (Figure 1-3). Some move rapidly and have fast-changing structures, as we can see in movies of amoebae and rotifers. Others are largely stationary and structurally stable. Oxygen kills some cells but is an absolute requirement for others. Most cells in multicellular organisms are intimately involved with other cells. Although some unicellular organisms live in isolation (Figure 1-3a), others form colonies or live in close association with other types of organisms (Figure 1-3b, d), such as the bacteria that help plants to extract nitrogen from the air or the bacteria that live in our intestines and help us digest food.

Yet the bewildering array of outward biological forms overlies a powerful uniformity: thanks to our common ancestry, all biological systems are composed of cells containing the same types of chemical molecules and employing similar principles of organization at the cellular level. Although the
