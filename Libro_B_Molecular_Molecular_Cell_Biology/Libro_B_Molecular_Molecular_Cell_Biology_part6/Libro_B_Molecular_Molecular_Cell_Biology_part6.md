When the $\alpha$ subunit is bound to GTP, the $\beta$ and $\gamma$ subunits dissociate as a heterodimer. The free $\alpha$ subunit and the free $\beta-\gamma$ heterodimer can then interact with other proteins and transduce a signal across the membrane. When the $\alpha$ subunit hydrolyzes the GTP to GDP and phosphate, the $\alpha$-GDP associates with the $\beta-\gamma$ heterodimer, terminating signaling. (Figure 15-14)

# ABOUT THE COVER 

Imaging of the intracellular organelles of a live human HeLa cell shows the dramatic morphological changes that accompany the process of cell division. The membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is labeled green by a fluorescently tagged component of the translocon (GFP-Sec61 $\beta$ ) and chromatin is labeled red by a fluorescently tagged histone (H2B-mRFP). Front: An interphase cell showing uncondensed chromatin filling the nucleus, with the ER as a reticulum of cisternae surrounding the nucleus and interconnected with lace-like tubules at the cell periphery. Back: Prior to cell division the chromatin condenses to reveal the worm-like structure of individual chromosomes, the nuclear envelope breaks down, and the ER condenses into an array of cisternae surrounding the condensed chromosomes. As cell division proceeds the replicated chromosomes will segregate equally into two daughter cells, nuclear envelopes will form in the daughter cells, and the ER will return to its characteristic reticular organization.

This book is available in hardcover (1-4641-8339-2) and loose-leaf (1-4641-8743-6) versions. This book is also available in digital format through LaunchPad (1-4641-8745-2), featuring a full e-Book and all instructor and student resources.
