The cochlea of the inner ear uses mechanotransduction to convert the energy in sound waves into neuronal signals. The distribution of type IV collagen in the extracellular matrix of the cochlear duct of a mouse was visualized by scanning thin-sheet laser imaging microscopy after removing the cells with the detergent SDS and the calcium with the chelator EDTA. The sample was then stained first with an anti-type IV collagen antibody and then a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. The false colors in the image represent the relative intensities of fluorescence (red $>$ yellow $>$ blue), and thus the relative local amounts of type IV collagen, in the basal lamina of the blood vessels (red), other basement membranes (yellow), and the cochlear wall (blue).

In the development of complex multicellular organisms such as plants and animals, progenitor cells differentiate into distinct "types" that have characteristic compositions, structures, and functions. Cells of a given type often aggregate into a tissue to cooperatively perform a common function: muscle contracts; neural tissue conducts electric impulses; xylem tissue in plants transports water. Different tissues can be organized into an organ, again to perform one or more specific functions. For instance, the muscles, valves, and blood vessels of a heart work together to pump blood. The coordinated functioning of many types of cells and tissues permits the organism to move, metabolize, reproduce, and carry out other essential activities. Indeed, the complex and diverse morphologies of plants and animals are examples of the whole being

greater than the sum of the individual parts, more technically described as the emergent properties of a complex system.

Vertebrates have hundreds of different cell types, including leukocytes (white blood cells) and erythrocytes (red blood cells), photoreceptors in the retina, fat-storing adipocytes, fibroblasts in connective tissue, and the hundreds of different subtypes of neurons in the human brain. Even simple animals exhibit complex tissue organization. The adult form of the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans contains a mere 959 cells, yet these cells fall into 12 different general cell types and many distinct subtypes. But despite their diverse forms and functions, all animal cells can be classified as components of just five main classes of tissue: epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue, neural tissue, and

blood. Various cell types are arranged in precise patterns of staggering complexity to generate tissues and organs. The costs of such complexity include increased requirements for information, material, energy, and time during the development of an individual organism. Although the physiological costs of complex tissues and organs are high, they confer the ability to thrive in varied and variable environments-a major evolutionary advantage.

One of the defining characteristics of animals such as ourselves with complex tissues and organs (metazoans) is that the external and internal surfaces of most of their tissues and organs-and indeed, the exterior of the entire organism-are built from tightly packed sheet-like layers of cells known as epithelia. The formation of an epithelium and its subsequent remodeling into more complex collections of epithelial and
nonepithelial tissues is a hallmark of the development of metazoans. Sheets of tightly attached epithelial cells act as regulatable, selectively permeable barriers, which permit the generation of chemically and functionally distinct compartments in an organism, such as the stomach and bloodstream. As a result, distinct and sometimes opposite functions (e.g., digestion and synthesis) can efficiently proceed simultaneously within an organism. Such compartmentalization also permits more sophisticated regulation of diverse biological functions. In many ways, the roles of complex tissues and organs in an organism are analogous to those of organelles and membranes in individual cells.

The assembly of distinct tissues and their organization into organs are determined by molecular interactions at the cellular level (Figure 20-1). These interactions would not be

FIGURE 20-1 Overview of major cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesive interactions. Schematic cutaway drawing of a typical epithelial tissue, such as in the inner surface of the intestines. The apical (upper) surface of each cell is packed with fingerlike microvilli (1) that project into the intestinal lumen, and the basal (lower) surface (2) rests on extracellular matrix (ECM). The ECM (3) associated with epithelial cells is usually organized into various interconnected layers-such as the basal lamina (4), connecting fibers (not shown), and connective tissue (5)—in which large, interdigitating ECM macromolecules bind to one another and to the cells (6). Cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) bind to CAMs on other cells, mediating cell-cell adhesion (7), and adhesion receptors bind to various components of the ECM, mediating cell-matrix adhesion (8). Both types of cell-surface adhesion molecules are usually integral membrane proteins whose cytosolic domains often bind to multiple intracellular adapter proteins. These adapters, directly or indirectly, link the CAM to the cytoskeleton (actin or intermediate filaments) and to intracellular signaling
pathways (as illustrated in Figure 20-8). As a consequence, information can be transferred by CAMs and the macromolecules to which they bind from the cell exterior to the intracellular environment (outside-in) and vice versa (inside-out). In some cases, a complex aggregate of CAMs, adapters, and associated proteins is assembled. Specific localized aggregates of CAMs or adhesion receptors form various types of cell junctions, which play important roles in holding tissues together and facilitating communication between cells and their environment. Tight junctions (9), lying just under the apical surface, prevent the diffusion of many substances through the extracellular spaces between the cells. Through connexion channels, gap junctions (10) allow the movement of small molecules and ions between the cytosols of adjacent cells. The remaining three types of junctions, adherens junctions (11) and (12), desmosomes (13), hemidesmosomes (14) and (15), and focal contacts (also called focal adhesions; (16) link the cytoskeleton of a cell to other cells or to the ECM. See V. Vasioukhin and E. Fuchs, 2001, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 13:76-84.

possible without the temporally, spatially, and functionally regulated expression of a wide array of adhesion molecules. Cells in tissues can adhere directly to one another (cell-cell adhesion) through specialized membrane proteins called cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs), which often cluster into specialized cell junctions. In the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, at least 500 genes ( $\sim 4$ percent of the total) are estimated to be involved in cell adhesion, and in mammals there are over 1000 such genes. Cells in animal tissues also adhere indirectly (cell-matrix adhesion) through the binding of adhesion receptors in the plasma membrane to components of the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM), a complex interdigitating meshwork of proteins and polysaccharides secreted by cells into the spaces between them. Some adhesion receptors can also function as CAMs, mediating direct interaction between cells.

Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions not only allow cells to aggregate into distinct tissues, but also provide a means for the bidirectional transfer of information between the exterior and the interior of cells. As we will see, both types of adhesions are intrinsically associated with the cytoskeleton and cellular signaling pathways. As a result, a cell's surroundings influence its shape and functional properties ("outside-in" effects); likewise, cellular shape and function influence a cell's surroundings ("inside-out" effects). Thus connectivity and communication are intimately related properties of cells in tissues. Information transfer is important to many biological processes, including cell survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration. Therefore, it is not surprising that defects that interfere with adhesive interactions and the associated flow of information can cause or contribute to diseases, including a wide variety of neuromuscular and skeletal disorders and cancer.

In this chapter, we examine various types of adhesion molecules found on the surfaces of cells and in the surrounding extracellular matrix. Interactions between these molecules allow the organization of cells into tissues and have profound effects on tissue development, function, and pathology. Many adhesion molecules are members of families or superfamilies of related proteins. While each type of adhesion molecule performs a distinct role, we will focus on the common features shared by members of some of these families to illustrate the general principles underlying their structures and functions. Because of the particularly wellunderstood nature of the adhesion molecules in tissues that form tight epithelia, as well as their very early evolutionary development, we will initially focus on epithelial tissues, such as the walls of the intestinal tract and the skin. Epithelial cells are normally nonmotile (sessile); however, during development, wound healing, and in certain pathological states (e.g., cancer), epithelial cells can transform into motile cells. Changes in the expression and function of adhesion molecules play a key role in this transformation, as they do in normal biological processes involving cell movement, such as the crawling of white blood cells into sites of infection. We therefore follow the discussion of epithelial tissues with a discussion of adhesion in nonepithelial, developing, and motile tissues.

The evolutionary lineages of plants and animals diverged before multicellular organisms arose. Thus multicellularity and the molecular means for assembling tissues and organs must have arisen independently in animal and plant lineages. Not surprisingly, then, animals and plants exhibit many differences in the organization and development of tissues. For this reason, we first consider the organization of tissues in animals and then deal separately with plants.

### 20.1 Cell-Cell and Cell-Extracellular Matrix Adhesion: An Overview

There are many different types of cells in the body that dynamically interact with each other in a myriad of ways. These interactions, achieved via adhesion molecules, must be precisely and carefully controlled in time and space to correctly determine the structures and functions of tissues in a complex organism. It is not surprising, therefore, that cellcell and cell-ECM adhesion molecules exhibit diverse structures, or that their expression levels vary in different cells and tissues. As a consequence, they mediate the very specific and distinctive cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions that hold tissues together as well as permit essential communication between cells and their environment. We begin this overview with a brief orientation to the various types of adhesion molecules present on cells and within the extracellular matrix, their major functions in organisms, and their evolutionary origin. In subsequent sections, we will examine in detail the unique structures and properties of various participants in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions.

## Cell-Adhesion Molecules Bind to One Another and to Intracellular Proteins

Cell-cell adhesion is mediated through membrane proteins called cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs). Many CAMs fall into one of four major families: the cadherins, the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, the integrins, and the selectins. As the schematic structures in Figure 20-2 illustrate, CAMs are often mosaics of multiple distinct domains, many of which can be found in more than one kind of protein. The functions of these domains vary. Some confer the ability to bind specifically to their partner CAMs on neighboring cells, or even to CAMs on the same cell. Some of these domains are present in multiple copies and contribute to the length of the CAMs, and thus help define the distance between the plasma membranes of cells bound together by the CAMs. Other membrane proteins, whose structures do not belong to any of the major classes of CAMs in Figure 20-2, are also CAMs and participate in cell-cell adhesion in various tissues. As we will see later, integrins can function both as CAMs and, as depicted in Figure 20-2, adhesion receptors that bind to ECM components. Some Ig-superfamily CAMs can play this dual role as well.

CAMs mediate, through their extracellular domains, adhesive interactions between cells of the same type (homotypic

![li0335345559](li0335345559.jpg)

FIGURE 20-2 Major families of cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) and adhesion receptors. E-cadherins commonly form cross-bridges with other E-cadherins (homophilic binding) on the same cell or on adjacent cells (see Figures 20-3 and 20-14). Members of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of CAMs can function as adhesion receptors or as CAMs that form homophilic linkages (as shown here for NCAM) or heterophilic linkages (to other types of CAMs, not shown). Heterodimeric integrins (for example, $\alpha v$ and $\beta 3$ chains) function as CAMs or as adhesion receptors (shown here) that bind to very large, multi-adhesive matrix proteins such as fibronectin, only a small part of which is shown here. Selectins,
![li0435345559](li0435345559.jpg)
shown as dimers, contain a carbohydrate-binding lectin domain that recognizes specialized sugar structures on glycoproteins (as shown here) or glycolipids on adjacent cells. Note that CAMs often form higher-order oligomers within the plane of the plasma membrane. Many adhesion molecules contain multiple distinct domains, some of which are found in more than one kind of CAM. The cytoplasmic domains of these proteins are often associated with adapter proteins that link them to the cytoskeleton or to signaling pathways. See R. O. Hynes, 1999, Trends Cell Biol. 9:M33, R. O. Hynes, 2002, Cell 110:673-687, and J. Brasch, O. J. Harrison, B. Honig, and L. Shapiro, 2012, Trends Cell Biol. 22:299-310.
adhesion) or between cells of different types (heterotypic adhesion). A CAM on one cell can directly bind to the same kind of CAM on an adjacent cell (homophilic binding) or to a different class of CAM (heterophilic binding). CAMs can be broadly distributed along the regions of plasma membranes that contact other cells or clustered in discrete patches or spots called cell junctions. Cell-cell adhesions can be tight and long lasting or relatively weak and transient. For example, the associations between neurons in the spinal cord or the metabolic cells in the liver exhibit tight adhesion. In contrast, immune-system cells in the blood often exhibit only brief, weak interactions, which allow them to roll along and pass through a blood vessel wall on their way to fight an infection within a tissue.

The cytosolic domains of CAMs recruit sets of multifunctional adapter proteins (see Figure 20-1). These adapters act as linkers that directly or indirectly connect CAMs to elements of the cytoskeleton (see Chapters 17 and 18); they can also recruit intracellular molecules that function in signaling pathways (see Chapters 15 and 16) to modify cellular behavior, including gene expression and the activities of a variety of intracellular proteins, including the CAMs themselves. In many cases, a complex aggregate of CAMs, adapter proteins, and other associated proteins is assembled at the inner surface of the plasma membrane. These complexes facilitate two-way, "outside-in" and "inside-out," communication between cells and their surroundings.

The formation of many cell-cell adhesions entails two types of molecular interactions, called trans and cis binding interactions (Figure 20-3). Trans interactions are also called intercellular or adhesive interactions, and cis interactions are also called intracellular or lateral interactions. In trans interactions, CAMs on one cell bind to the CAMs on an adjacent cell. In cis interactions, monomeric CAMs on one cell bind to one or more CAMs in the same cell's plasma membrane. The lateral interactions in one cell may increase the probability of monomer-to-monomer or oligomer-to-oligomer trans interactions with clustered CAMs on an adjacent cell. In addition, formation of monomer-to-monomer trans interactions can induce cis interactions that can then strengthen trans adhesive interactions. It appears that trans and cis interactions are mutually reinforcing.

![li0535345559](li0535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 20-3 Model for the generation of cell-cell adhesions. Lateral interactions between cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) within the plasma membrane of a cell can form clusters of monomers (left). The parts of the molecules that participate in these cis interactions vary among the different CAMs. Trans interactions between domains
of CAMs on adjacent cells generate a strong, Velcro-like adhesion between the cells. The models shown here are based on CAMs called cadherins. See M. S. Steinberg and P. M. McNutt, 1999, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 11:554 and J. Brasch, O. J. Harrison, B. Honig, and L. Shapiro, 2012, Trends Cell Biol. 22:299-310.

Adhesive interactions between cells vary considerably, depending on the tissue and the particular CAMs participating. Just like Velcro, CAMs can generate very tight adhesion when many weak interactions are combined, and this is especially the case when CAMs are concentrated in small, well-defined areas such as cell junctions. Some CAMs require calcium ions to form effective adhesions. Furthermore, the association of intracellular molecules with the cytosolic domains of CAMs can dramatically influence the intermolecular interactions of CAMs by promoting their clustering together and cis association or by altering their conformation in a way that increases the affinity of trans interactions. Among the many variables that determine the nature of adhesion between two cells are the binding affinity of the interacting molecules (thermodynamic properties), the overall "on" and "off" rates of association and dissociation for each interacting molecule (kinetic properties), the spatial distribution or density of adhesion molecules (ensemble properties), the active versus inactive states of CAMs with respect to adhesion (biochemical properties), and external forces such as stretching and pulling, such as that in muscle, or the laminar and turbulent flow of cells and surrounding fluids in the circulatory system (mechanical properties).

## The Extracellular Matrix Participates in Adhesion, Signaling, and Other Functions

The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a complex combination of proteins and polysaccharides that is secreted and assembled by cells into a network in which the components bind to one another. The ECM is often involved in holding cells and tissues together. The composition, physical properties, and functions of the ECM are carefully controlled and can vary depending on the tissue type, its location, its physiological state, and chemical modifications of its components. These modifications include enzymatic phosphorylation, sulfation and desulfation, cross-linking, cleavage by proteases and glycosidases, and oxidation, as well as nonenzymatic addition of glucose (glycation).

The ECM is usually sensed by cells as a consequence of binding to adhesion receptors on their plasma membranes, which then instruct the cells to behave appropriately in response to their environments or modulate the structure and function of the ECM based on the state of the cells. Different cells can bind to the same patch of ECM via their adhesion receptors and thus be indirectly bound together. ECM components include proteoglycans, a unique type of glycoprotein (a protein with covalently attached sugars); collagens and other proteins that often form fibers; soluble multi-adhesive matrix proteins; and others (Table 20-1). Multi-adhesive matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin, are long, flexible molecules that contain multiple domains. They are responsible for binding various types of collagen, other matrix proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular signaling molecules as well as adhesion receptors. These proteins are important organizers of the extracellular matrix. Through their interactions with adhesion receptors, they also regulate cell-matrix adhesion-and thus cell shape and behavior.

Cells contribute to the assembly of the ECM not only by secreting its components, but also by participating directly in the assembly of those components into complex structures containing large fibrils and amorphous macromolecules. Once assembled, the ECM often is not static, but rather highly dynamic in that its chemical, physical, and biological properties can be altered quantitatively or qualitatively as a consequence of cells secreting enzymes, such as proteases, and other molecules into the extracellular space. These alterations in the ECM, which are usually referred to as "remodeling," can involve covalent chemical modifications (including chemical cross-linking of ECM molecules), partial

TABLE 20-1 Extracellular Matrix Proteins
![li0635345559](li0635345559.jpg)
or essentially complete proteolytic cleavage of ECM components, and addition of newly synthesized ECM molecules.

The relative volumes occupied by cells and their surrounding matrix vary greatly among different animal tissues. Some connective tissue, for instance, is mostly matrix with relatively few cells, whereas many other tissues, such as epithelia, are composed of very densely packed cells with relatively little matrix (Figure 20-4). The density of packing of the molecules within the ECM itself can also vary greatly.
H. V. Wilson's classic studies of adhesion in marine sponge cells showed conclusively that one primary function of the ECM is to literally hold tissue together. Figures 20-5a and 20-5b, which re-create Wilson's classic work, show that when sponges are mechanically dissociated and individual
cells from two sponge species are mixed, the cells of one species will adhere to one another, but not to cells from the other species. This specificity is due in part to species-specific adhesive proteins in the ECM that bind to the cells via adhesion receptors. These adhesive proteins can be purified and used to coat colored beads, which, when mixed, aggregate with one another with a specificity similar to that of intact sponge cells (Figure 20-5c, d).

The ECM plays a multitude of other roles in addition to facilitating cell adhesion (Table 20-2). Different combinations of components tailor the ECM for specific purposes at different anatomic sites: strength in a tendon, strength and rigidity in teeth and bones, cushioning in cartilage, and transparency in the vitreous humor in the eyeball. The composition of the

ECM also provides positional and signaling information for cells, letting a cell know where it is and what it should do. ECM remodeling can modulate the interactions of a cell with its environment.

assembly. Morphogenesis-the stage of embryonic development in which tissues, organs, and body parts are formed by cell movements and rearrangements-is critically dependent on cell-matrix adhesion as well as cell-cell adhesion. For example, cell-matrix interactions are required for branching morphogenesis (formation of branching structures) to form blood vessels, the air sacs in the lung, mammary and salivary glands, and other structures (Figure 20-6).

Disruptions in cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions can have devastating consequences for the development of tissues. Figure 20-7 shows the dramatic changes in the skeletal system of embryonic mice when the genes for either of two key ECM molecules, collagen II and perlecan, are inactivated. Disruptions in adhesion and ECM functions are also characteristic of various pathologies, including cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, kidney, skin, eye, and bone diseases as well as metastatic cancer, in which cancer cells leave their normal locations and spread throughout the body.

Although many CAMs and adhesion receptors were initially identified and characterized because of their adhesive properties, they also play major roles in signaling, using many of the pathways discussed in Chapters 15 and 16. Figure 20-8 illustrates how one adhesion receptor, integrin, physically and functionally interacts, via adapters and signaling molecules, with a broad array of intracellular signaling pathways to influence cell survival, gene transcription, cytoskeletal organization, cell motility, and cell proliferation. Conversely, changes in the activities of signaling pathways inside cells can influence the structures of CAMs and adhesion receptors-for example, by altering adapter binding to the cytosolic portions of the CAMs-and so modulate their ability to interact with other cells and with the ECM. Thus outside-in and inside-out signaling involve numerous interconnected pathways.

## The Evolution of Multifaceted Adhesion Molecules Made Possible the Evolution of Diverse Animal Tissues

Cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions are responsible for the formation, composition, architecture, and function of animal tissues. Not surprisingly, some adhesion molecules are evolutionarily ancient and are among the most highly conserved proteins in multicellular organisms. Sponges, the most primitive multicellular organisms, express certain CAMs and multi-adhesive ECM molecules whose structures are strikingly similar to those of the corresponding human proteins. The evolution of metazoans has depended on the evolution of diverse adhesion molecules with novel properties and functions whose levels of expression differ in different types of cells. Some CAMs and adhesion receptors (e.g., cadherins, integrins, and Ig-superfamily CAMs such as L1CAM) and some ECM components (type IV collagen, laminin, nidogen/entactin, and perlecan-like proteoglycans) are highly conserved because they play crucial roles in many different organisms, whereas other adhesion molecules are less conserved. Fruit flies, for example, do not have certain types of collagen or the ECM protein fibronectin, which play important roles in mammals. A common feature of adhesive proteins is repeating, nearly identical domains (sometimes called repeats) that form very large proteins. The overall length of these molecules, combined with their ability to bind numerous ligands via distinct functional domains, probably played a role in their evolution.

The diversity of adhesion molecules arises in large part from two phenomena that can generate the numerous closely related proteins, called isoforms, that constitute a protein family. In some cases, the different members of a protein family are encoded by multiple genes that arose from a common ancestor by gene duplication and divergent evolution (see the human $\beta$-like globin gene cluster in Chapter 8). In other cases, a single gene produces an RNA transcript that can undergo alternative splicing to yield multiple mRNAs, each encoding a distinct protein isoform (see Figure 8-3 and

![li1135345559](li1135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 20-8 Integrin adhesion receptormediated signaling pathways control diverse cell functions. Binding of integrins to their ligands induces conformational changes in their cytoplasmic domains, directly or indirectly altering their interactions with cytoplasmic proteins (outside-in signaling). These cytoplasmic proteins include adapter proteins (e.g., talins, kindlins, paxillin, vinculin) and signaling kinases [Src-family kinases, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), integrin-linked kinase (ILK)] that transmit signals via diverse signaling pathways, thereby influencing cell proliferation, cell survival, cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and gene transcription. Components of several signaling pathways, some of which are associated directly with the plasma membrane, are shown in green boxes. Many of the components of the pathways shown here are shared with other cell-surfaceactivated signaling pathways (e.g., receptor tyrosine kinases shown on the right) and are discussed in Chapters 15 and 16. In turn, intracellular signaling pathways can, via adapter proteins, modify the ability of integrins to bind to their extracellular ligands (inside-out signaling). See W. Guo and F. G. Giancotti, 2004, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 5:816-826, and R. O. Hynes, 2002, Cell 110:673-687.

Section 10.2). Both phenomena contribute to the diversity of some protein families, such as the cadherins. Particular isoforms of an adhesive protein are often expressed in some cell types and tissues, but not others.

## Cell-Adhesion Molecules Mediate Mechanotransduction

Mechanotransduction is the reciprocal interconversion of a mechanical force-or stimulus-and biochemical processes. These interconversions underlie a variety of biological activities, such as signaling, regulated gene expression, cell proliferation, cell migration, and interactions among cells and between cells and the ECM. Mechanotransduction in the context of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions usually involves a cell-surface CAM or adhesion receptor that transmits mechanical force or biochemical information across the plasma membrane and one or more intracellular or extracellular mechanosensors that respond to the mechanical stimulus by changing shape and activity (see also Chapter 22). For example, tension applied across the length of a multidomain mechanosensor protein, such as the ECM protein fibronectin or the integrin adapter protein talin, can literally pull apart one or more domains, thereby exposing binding sites that were otherwise inaccessible (cryptic) in the folded domain (Figure 20-9). The newly accessible binding sites can then recruit binding partners-in some cases after phosphorylation-and alter cellular or extracellular functions. For example, the stretching of fibronectins by integrins induces their assembly into fibrils, which in some cases is an early step in the assembly of collagen and other molecules into ECM. The mechanical forces in mechanotransduction can be forces generated within a cell, such as myosin-driven movement of actin filaments (Chapter 17), or outside a cell, such as blood flow, movement of adjacent cells, or contraction or expansion of ECM.

Mechanical force generated within the cell by actin movement and mechanotransduced via multiple integrin adhesion receptors bound to the extracellular dimeric fibronectin can partially unfold the fibronectin. The unfolding is thought to expose a putative, previously hidden (cryptic) binding site on fibronectin (blue segment) that has the potential to form $\beta$ sheets with other fibronectin molecules, recruiting them to form fibronectin fibrils, and thus helping assemble the ECM.

- Cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) mediate direct cell-cell adhesions (homotypic and heterotypic), and adhesion receptors mediate cell-matrix adhesions (see Figure 20-1). These interactions bind cells into tissues and facilitate communication between cells and their environments.
- The cytosolic domains of CAMs and adhesion receptors bind adapter proteins that mediate interaction with cytoskeletal fibers and intracellular signaling proteins.
- The major families of CAMs are the cadherins, selectins, Ig-superfamily CAMs, and integrins (see Figure 20-2). Members of the integrin and Ig-CAM superfamilies can also function as adhesion receptors.
- Tight cell-cell adhesions entail both cis (lateral or intracellular) oligomerization of CAMs and trans (adhesive or intercellular) interactions of like (homophilic) or different (heterophilic) CAMs (see Figure 20-3). The combination of cis and trans interactions produces a Velcro-like adhesion between cells.
to mechanical stretching force. This force is generated by actin, which can bind to and pull on the C-terminus of talin while talin's N-terminus is bound to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin's $\beta$ subunit. The unfolding is thought to expose this domain's otherwise cryptic $\alpha$-helical vinculin binding site (blue). Vinculin, an actin-binding protein (see Figure 20-14d), can then bind to the integrin-talin complex via the exposed site and in turn bind to actin, thus promoting the assembly of multiple actin fibers. The assembly of actin fibers indirectly linked by adapters to integrins strengthens integrin-mediated adhesion and helps to build focal adhesions. (Part (a) data from E. P. Gee et al., 2013, J. Biol.

- The extracellular matrix (ECM) is a dynamic, complex meshwork of proteins and polysaccharides that contributes to the structure and function of a tissue (see Table 20-2). The major classes of ECM molecules are proteoglycans, collagens, and multi-adhesive matrix proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin.

### 20.2 Cell-Cell and Cell-Extracellular Junctions and Their Adhesion Molecules

Cells in epithelial and in nonepithelial tissues use many, but not all, of the same cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion molecules. Because of the relatively simple organization of epithelia, as well as their fundamental role in evolution and development, we begin our detailed discussion of adhesion with epithelia. In this section, we focus on regions of the cell surface that contain clusters of adhesion molecules in discrete patches or spots, called anchoring junctions, tight junctions, and gap junctions. Anchoring and tight junctions play critical roles in mediating cell-cell and cell-ECM adhesion, and all three types of junctions mediate intercellular or cell-ECM communication.

## Epithelial Cells Have Distinct Apical, Lateral, and Basal Surfaces

Cells that form epithelial tissues are said to be polarized because their plasma membranes are organized into discrete regions. Typically, the distinct surfaces of a polarized epithelial cell are called the apical (top), lateral (side), and basal (base or bottom) surfaces (Figure 20-10; see also Figure 20-1). The area of the apical surface is often greatly expanded by the formation of microvilli. Adhesion molecules play essential roles in generating and maintaining these distinct surfaces.

Epithelia in different body locations have characteristic morphologies and functions (see Figure 20-10; see also Figure 1-4). Stratified (multilayered) epithelia commonly serve as barriers and protective surfaces (e.g., the skin), whereas simple (single-layered) epithelia often selectively move ions and small molecules from one side of the epithelium to the other. For instance, the simple columnar epithelium lining the stomach secretes hydrochloric acid into the lumen; a similar epithelium lining the small intestine transports products of digestion from the lumen of the intestine across the cells into the blood (see Figure 11-30).

In simple columnar epithelia, adhesive interactions between the lateral surfaces hold the cells together in a two-dimensional sheet, whereas those at the basal surface connect the cells to a specialized underlying extracellular matrix called the basal lamina. Often the basal and lateral surfaces are similar in composition and are collectively called the basolateral surface. The basolateral surfaces of most simple epithelia are usually on the side of the cell closest to the blood vessels, whereas the apical surface is not in stable, direct contact with other cells or the ECM. In animals with closed circulatory systems, blood flows through vessels whose inner lining is composed of flattened epithelial cells called endothelial cells. In general, epithelial cells are sessile, immobile cells, in that adhesion molecules firmly and stably attach them to one another and their associated ECM. One especially important mechanism that generates strong, stable adhesions is the concentration of subsets of these molecules into clusters called cell junctions.

FIGURE 20-10 Principal types of epithelia. The apical, lateral, and basal surfaces of epithelial cells can exhibit distinctive characteristics. Often the basal and lateral sides of cells are not distinguishable and are collectively known as the basolateral surface. (a) Simple columnar epithelia consist of elongated cells, including mucus-secreting cells (in the lining of the stomach and cervical tract) and absorptive cells (in the lining of the small intestine). The thin protrusions at the apical surface are microvilli (see Figure 20-11). (b) Simple squamous epithelia, composed of thin cells, line the blood vessels (endothelial cells/endothelium) and many body cavities. (c) Transitional epithelia, composed of several layers of cells with different shapes, line certain cavities subject to expansion and contraction (e.g., the urinary bladder). (d) Stratified squamous (nonkeratinized) epithelia line surfaces such as the mouth and vagina; these linings resist abrasion and generally do not participate in the absorption or secretion of materials into or out of the cavity. The basal lamina, a thin fibrous network of collagen and other ECM components, supports all epithelia and connects them to the underlying connective tissue.

## Three Types of Junctions Mediate Many Cell-Cell and Cell-ECM Interactions

All epithelial cells in a sheet are connected to one another and to the ECM by specialized junctions. Although hundreds of individual dispersed adhesion molecule-mediated interactions are sufficient to cause cells to adhere, the clustered groups of adhesion molecules at cell junctions play special roles in imparting strength and rigidity to a tissue, transmitting information between the extracellular and the intracellular space, controlling the passage of ions and molecules across cell layers, and serving as conduits for the movement of ions and molecules from the cytoplasm of one cell to that of its immediate neighbor. Particularly important to epithelia is the formation of junctions that help form tight seals between the cells and thus allow the epithelial sheet to serve as a barrier to the flow of molecules from one side of the sheet to the other.

Three major classes of animal-cell junctions are prominent features of simple columnar epithelia (Figure 20-11 and Table 20-3): anchoring junctions, tight junctions, and gap
junctions. Anchoring junctions and tight junctions perform the key task of holding the tissue together. As we shall see, tight junctions also control the flow of solutes through the extracellular spaces between the cells forming an epithelial sheet. Tight junctions are found primarily in epithelial cells, whereas anchoring junctions can be seen in both epithelial and nonepithelial cells. Anchoring junctions and tight junctions in epithelia are organized into three parts: (1) adhesive proteins in the plasma membrane that connect one cell to another cell on the lateral surfaces (CAMs) or to the ECM on the basal surfaces (adhesion receptors); (2) adapter proteins, which connect the CAMs or adhesion receptors to cytoskeletal filaments and signaling molecules; and (3) the cytoskeletal filaments themselves.

The third class of junctions, gap junctions, permits the rapid diffusion of small, water-soluble molecules between the cytoplasms of adjacent cells. Along with anchoring and tight junctions, gap junctions help a cell communicate with its environment. However, they are structurally very different from anchoring junctions and tight junctions and do not play a key role in strengthening cell-cell and cell-ECM

FIGURE 20-11 Principal types of cell junctions connecting the columnar epithelial cells lining the small intestine. (a) Schematic cutaway drawing of intestinal epithelial cells. The basal surface of the cells rests on a basal lamina, and the apical surface is packed with fingerlike microvilli that project into the intestinal lumen. Tight junctions, lying just under the microvilli, prevent the diffusion of many substances between the intestinal lumen and internal body fluids (such as the blood) via the extracellular space
between cells. Gap junctions allow the movement of small molecules and ions between the cytosols of adjacent cells. The remaining three types of junctions-adherens junctions, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes-are critical to cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion and signaling.

adhesions. Found in both epithelial and nonepithelial cells, gap junctions resemble the distinct cell junctions in plants called plasmodesmata, which we discuss in Section 20.6.

Four types of anchoring junctions are present in cells. Two participate in cell-cell adhesion and two participate in cell-matrix adhesion. Adherens junctions connect the lateral membranes of adjacent epithelial cells and are usually located near the apical surface, just below the tight junctions (see Figure 20-11). A circumferential belt of actin and myosin filaments in a complex with the adherens junctions functions as a tension cable that can internally brace the cell and thereby control its shape. Epithelial and some other types of cells, such as smooth muscle and heart cells, are also bound tightly together by desmosomes, snap-like points of contact sometimes called spot desmosomes. Hemidesmosomes, found mainly on the basal surface of epithelial cells, and focal contacts (also called focal adhesions) anchor an epithelium to components of the underlying ECM, much like nails holding down a carpet. Adherens junctions, desmosomes, and focal adhesions are found in many different types of cells; hemidesmosomes appear to be restricted to epithelial cells.

Bundles of intermediate filaments running parallel to the cell surface or through the cell connect desmosomes and hemidesmosomes, imparting shape and rigidity to the cell, as do actin filaments that connect the cytoskeleton with focal contacts and adherens junctions. The close interaction between these junctions and the cytoskeleton helps transmit shear forces from one region of a cell layer to the epithelium as a whole, providing strength and rigidity to the entire epithelial cell layer. Desmosomes and hemidesmosomes are
especially important in maintaining the integrity of skin epithelia. As a consequence, mutations that interfere with hemidesmosomal anchoring in the skin can lead to a condition in which the epithelium becomes detached from its underlying matrix and extracellular fluid accumulates at the basolateral surface, forcing the skin to balloon outward, forming a blister.

## Cadherins Mediate Cell-Cell Adhesions in Adherens Junctions and Desmosomes

The primary CAMs in adherens junctions and desmosomes belong to the cadherin family. In vertebrates, this protein superfamily of more than a hundred members can be grouped into at least six subfamilies, including classical cadherins and desmosomal cadherins, which we will describe below. The diversity of cadherins arises from the presence of multiple cadherin genes and alternative RNA splicing. It is not surprising that there are many different types of cadherins in vertebrates. Many different types of cells in the widely diverse tissues of these animals use cadherins to mediate adhesion and communication, the detailed requirements for which may differ for different types of cells and tissues. Members of the cadherin superfamily can also control cell morphology, such as the assembly and tight packing of microvilli on the apical surfaces of some epithelial cells (see Figures 20-10a and 20-11a). The brain expresses the largest number of different cadherins, presumably owing to the necessity of forming many specific cell-cell contacts to help establish its complex wiring pattern. Invertebrates, however, are able to function with fewer than 20 cadherins.

Classical Cadherins The classical cadherins include E-, N-, and P-cadherins, named for the type of tissue in which they were initially identified (epithelial, neural, and placental, respectively). E- and N -cadherins are the most widely expressed, particularly during early differentiation. Sheets of polarized epithelial cells, such as those that line the small intestine or kidney tubules, contain abundant E-cadherin along their lateral surfaces. Although E-cadherin is concentrated in adherens junctions, it is present throughout the lateral surfaces, where it is thought to link adjacent cell membranes.

The results of experiments with L cells, a line of cultured mouse fibroblasts, demonstrated that E-cadherins preferentially mediate homophilic interactions. L cells express no cadherins and adhere poorly to each other and to other types of cells. When the E-cadherin gene was introduced into L cells, the cells were found to adhere preferentially to other cells expressing E-cadherin (Figure 20-12). These engineered cadherin-expressing L cells formed epithelium-like aggregates with one another and with epithelial cells isolated from lungs. Although most E-cadherins exhibit primarily homophilic binding, some mediate heterophilic interactions.

The adhesiveness of cadherins depends on the presence of extracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$; it is this property (calcium adhering) that gave rise to their name. For example, the adhesion of L cells expressing E-cadherin is prevented when the cells are bathed in a solution that is low in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (see Figure 20-12). Some adhesion molecules require some minimal amount of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the extracellular fluid to function properly, whereas others, such as IgCAMs, are $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ independent.

The role of E-cadherin in adhesion can also be demonstrated by experiments with cultured epithelial cells called Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (see Figure 4-4). A green fluorescent protein-labeled form of E-cadherin has been used in these cells to show that clusters of E-cadherin mediate the initial attachment of the cells and the subsequent zippering of the cells into sheets (Figure 20-13). In this experimental system, the addition of an antibody that binds to E-cadherin, preventing its homophilic interactions,

Under standard cell culture conditions, in the presence of calcium in the extracellular fluid, $L$ cells do not aggregate into sheets (left).

An E-cadherin gene fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) was introduced into cultured MDCK cells. The cells were then mixed together in a calciumcontaining medium, and the distribution of fluorescent E-cadherin was visualized over time (shown in hours). Clusters of E-cadherin mediate the initial attachment and subsequent zippering up of the epithelial cells and the formation of junctions (bicellular junctions are where two cells join and appear as lines; tricellular junctions are the sites of intersection of three cells).

## FIGURE 20-14 Intercellular and intracellular interactions of

classical cadherins in typical adherens junctions. (a)The exoplasmic cadherin domains [EC1-EC5, see ovals in part (b)] of E-cadherins at adherens junctions on adjacent cells are clustered by homophilic cis and trans interactions. The $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent elongated and curved structure of cadherin's extracellular domains is necessary for stable cis and trans interactions. Sites representing individual cis and trans interactions are highlighted by dashed circles. (b) EC1-EC2 cis interaction: The binding of an EC1 domain of one cadherin to an EC2 domain of an adjacent cadherin on the same cell is responsible for cis interactions. In panels (b) and (c) the structure of each extracellular cadherin domain determined by X-ray crystallography is represented using a ribbon diagram and is highlighted by an oval. (c) EC1-EC1 trans interaction: Two views rotated by $90^{\circ}$ of the trans binding of an EC1 domain of one cadherin to an EC1 domain of a cadherin on the adjacent cell. Only the EC1 and a portion of the EC2 domains of two trans interacting cadherins are shown. The left view shows the relative orientations of the main axes of the oval-shaped EC1 domains. The right view shows how a small segment of polypeptide at the N -terminus of each of the two EC1 domains [highlighted in yellow (cell 1) and blue (cell 2)] swings out and replaces the equivalent segment from its binding partner (strand swap, dashed oval). The strand swap places the side chain of a tryptophan residue on each of the segments into a binding pocket on the adjacent EC1 domain - an interaction that substantially stabilizes the trans binding. (d) The cytosolic domains of the E-cadherins bind directly or indirectly to multiple adapter proteins (e.g., $\beta$-catenin), which both connect the junctions to actin filaments (F-actin) of the cytoskeleton and participate in intracellular signaling pathways. Somewhat different sets of adapter proteins are illustrated in the two cells to emphasize that a variety of adapters can interact with adherens junctions. Some of these adapters, such as ZO-1, can interact with several different CAMs. See V. Vasioukhin and E. Fuchs, 2001, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 13:76 and J. Brasch, O. J. Harrison, B. Honig, and L. Shapiro, 2012, Trends Cell Biol. 22:299. [Data from O. J. Harrison et al., 2011, Structure 19:244-256, PDB ID 3q2w.]

blocks the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent attachment of MDCK cells to one another and the subsequent formation of intercellular adherens junctions.

Each classical cadherin molecule contains a single transmembrane domain, a relatively short C-terminal cytosolic domain, and five extracellular "cadherin" domains (called EC1-EC5) (see Figure 20-2). The extracellular domains are necessary for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding and cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. Classical cadherin-mediated adhesion entails both cis lateral clustering (intracellular) and trans adhesive (intercellular) molecular interactions (see Figures 20-3 and 20-14a-c). The binding of three $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ at each of the sites located between the cadherin repeats (see Figures 20-2 and 20-14a) stabilizes the elongated and curved structure of the extracellular domain. As we shall see shortly, the curved structure of cadherin's extracellular domain is necessary for the proper molecular complementarity that stabilizes cis and trans binding between cadherin molecules. The cis and trans interactions of cadherins, together with their interactions with cytoplasmic adapter and cytoskeletal molecules, permit the zippering up of cadherins into adhesive arrays. Binding of the EC1 domain of one cadherin molecule to the EC1 domain of another on the adjacent cell is responsible for trans binding (Figure 20-14; see also Figure 20-3). Although the dissociation constant $\left(K_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ for EC1-EC1 homophilic binding measured using isolated domains in solution is on the order of $10^{-5}-10^{-4} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$ (relatively weak, or low-affinity, binding), the multiple low-affinity interactions in arrays of intact cadherin molecules on adjacent cells sum to produce a very tight intercellular adhesion.

Determination of the structures of the extracellular domains of cadherins, together with analyses of the structures and binding properties of many mutants of the key binding domains, have provided a clear picture of the cis and trans interactions that underlie classical cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. The key features of cadherin cis and trans binding interactions are (1) the calcium-dependent curvature of the five extracellular cadherin domains that permits proper relative orientations of the EC1 and EC2 domains (see Figures 20-2 and 20-14); (2) for cis interactions, the binding of one side of an EC1 domain to a complementary surface on the EC2 domain of an adjacent molecule on the same membrane (see Figures 20-2 and 20-14); and (3) for trans interactions, the binding of a different surface of the EC1 domain to an EC1 domain from a cadherin molecule on the adjacent cell. The trans EC1-EC1 binding is stabilized when a small segment of the protein at the N -terminus of each of the two EC1 domains swings out and replaces the equivalent segment from its binding partner (strand swap; see Figure 20-14).

The C-terminal cytosolic domain of classical cadherins is linked to the actin cytoskeleton by adapter proteins (see Figure 20-14d). These linkages are essential for strong adhesion, as a moderate increase in tension generated by the actin cytoskeleton induces the formation of larger clusters of cadherins and stronger intercellular adhesion. Some of the increased cadherin-mediated adhesion that accompanies increased force applied by the actin cytoskeleton appears
to be mediated by one of the adapter proteins, $\alpha$-catenin, a mechanosensor that links cadherin to actin filaments (see Figure 20-14d) and changes shape (stretches out) when subjected to force. This stretching uncovers additional binding sites for other adapter molecules on the $\alpha$-catenin. Disruption of the interactions between classical cadherins and $\alpha$-catenin or $\beta$-catenin-another common adapter protein that links classical cadherins to actin filaments (see Figure 20-14d)dramatically reduces cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion. This disruption occurs spontaneously in tumor cells, which sometimes fail to express $\alpha$-catenin, and can be induced experimentally by depleting the cytosolic pool of accessible $\beta$-catenin. The cytosolic domains of cadherins also interact with intracellular signaling molecules such as p120-catenin. Interestingly, $\beta$-catenin plays a dual role: it not only mediates cytoskeletal attachment, but also serves as a signaling molecule, translocating to the nucleus and altering gene transcription in the Wnt signaling pathway (see Figure 16-30).

Classical cadherins play a critical role during tissue differentiation. Each classical cadherin has a characteristic tissue distribution. In the course of differentiation, the amounts or types of cell-surface cadherins change, affecting many aspects of cell-cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell division. For instance, the normal reorganization of tissues during morphogenesis is often accompanied by the conversion of nonmotile epithelial cells into motile cells, called mesenchymal cells, that are precursors for other tissues. This epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is associated with a reduction in the expression of E-cadherin (Figure 20-15a, b). The EMT is also associated with pathology, as in the conversion of epithelial cells into malignant carcinoma cells. For example, certain ductal breast tumors and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (Figure 20-15c) characteristically involve a loss of E-cadherin activity. It is well known that animal cell-cell contact can inhibit cell proliferation. During tissue development, once dividing epithelial cells have formed a well-defined, tightly bound epithelium, they have no need for further cell division unless they are damaged or receive a signal to undergo the EMT. It is now clear that one mechanism used to inhibit proliferation of epithelial cells in epithelia is E-cadherin- and catenin-mediated regulation of the Hippo pathway that controls cell proliferation (see Chapter 19).

The firm epithelial cell-cell adhesions mediated by cadherins in adherens junctions permit the formation of a second class of intercellular junctions in epithelia-tight junctions, to which we will turn shortly.

$\square$ Infection with rhinoviruses (RV) is the most frequent cause of the common cold, and infection with virulent class C rhinoviruses (RV-C) can cause more severe illnesses, including exacerbation of asthma. To enter cells and replicate, RV-C must bind to cell-surface receptors. Recent studies have identified a cadherin-family member called CDHR3, which is highly expressed in epithelial cells in the human airway, as a receptor for RV-C. Pathogens such as RV-C often evolve to co-opt proteins that have normal functions in their target (host) tissues. Genetic studies have shown that a

naturally occurring mutation in humans that changes a cysteine to tyrosine $(\mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{Y})$ in the EC5 domain of CDHR3 is associated with increased wheezing illnesses and hospitalizations for childhood asthma. In cultured cells, this $\mathrm{C} \rightarrow \mathrm{Y}$ mutation increases the cell-surface expression of CDHR3 and the binding and replication of RV-C. Treatments that disrupt the RV-C/cadherin (CDHR3) interaction have the potential to prevent or treat respiratory diseases caused by RV-C.

Desmosomal Cadherins Desmosomes (Figure 20-16) contain two specialized cadherins, desmoglein and desmocollin, whose cytosolic domains are distinct from those in the

classical cadherins. The cytosolic domains of desmosomal cadherins bind to adapter proteins such as plakoglobin (similar in structure to $\beta$-catenin) and plakophilins, and these bind to a member of the plakin family of adapters, called desmoplakin. These adapters form the thick cytoplasmic plaques that are characteristic of desmosomes. The desmoplakins directly mediate plaque binding to intermediate filaments.

The cadherin desmoglein was identified through studies of an unusual but revealing skin disease called pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune disease. Patients with autoimmune disorders synthesize self-attacking, or "auto," antibodies that bind to a normal body protein. In pemphigus vulgaris, the auto-antibodies disrupt adhesion between epithelial cells, causing blisters of the skin and mucous membranes. The predominant auto-antibodies in patients were shown to be specific for desmoglein; indeed, the addition of such antibodies to normal skin induces the formation of blisters and disruption of cell adhesion.

## Integrins Mediate Cell-ECM Adhesions, Including Those in Epithelial-Cell Hemidesmosomes

To be stably anchored to solid tissues and organs, simple columnar epithelial sheets must be firmly attached via their basal surfaces to the underlying ECM (basal lamina). This attachment occurs via adhesion receptors called integrins (see Figure 20-2), which are located both within and outside of anchoring junctions called hemidesmosomes (see Figure 20-11a). Hemidesmosomes comprise integral membrane proteins linked via cytoplasmic adapter proteins (e.g., plakins) to keratin-based intermediate filaments. The principal ECM adhesion receptor in epithelial hemidesmosomes is integrin $\alpha 6 \beta 4$.

Integrins function as adhesion receptors and CAMs in a wide variety of epithelial and nonepithelial cells, mediating many cell-matrix and cell-cell interactions (Table 20-4). In vertebrates, at least 24 integrin heterodimers, composed of

18 types of $\alpha$ subunits and 8 types of $\beta$ subunits in various $\alpha \beta$ heterodimeric combinations, are known. A single type of $\beta$ chain can interact with any one of several different types of $\alpha$ chains, forming distinct integrins that bind different ligands. This phenomenon of combinatorial diversity allows a relatively small number of components to serve a large number of distinct functions. Although most cells express several distinct integrins that bind the same or different ligands, many integrins are expressed predominantly in certain types of cells. Not only do many integrins bind more than one ligand, but there are ligands that can bind to any one of several different integrins.

All integrins appear to have evolved from two ancient general subgroups: those that bind proteins containing the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, usually called the RGD motif (fibronectin is one such protein), and those that bind laminin. Several integrin $\alpha$ subunits contain a distinctive inserted domain, the I-domain, which can mediate binding of certain integrins to various collagens in the ECM. Some integrins with I-domains are expressed exclusively on leukocytes (white blood cells) and red and white blood cell precursor (hematopoietic) cells. I-domains also recognize CAMs on other cells, including members of the Ig superfamily (e.g., ICAMs, VCAMs), and thus participate in cell-cell adhesion.

Integrins typically exhibit low affinities for their ligands, with dissociation constants $\left(K_{\mathrm{d}}\right)$ between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}$. However, the multiple weak interactions generated by the binding of hundreds or thousands of integrin molecules to their ligands on cells or in the ECM allow a cell to remain firmly anchored to its ligand-expressing target.

Parts of both the $\alpha$ subunit and the $\beta$ subunit of an integrin molecule contribute to the primary extracellular ligandbinding site (see Figure 20-2). Ligand binding to integrins also requires the simultaneous binding of divalent cations. Like that of other adhesion molecules, the cytosolic region of integrins interacts with adapter proteins, which in turn bind to the cytoskeleton and to intracellular signaling molecules (see Figure 20-8). Most integrins are linked via adapters to the actin cytoskeleton, including two of the integrins that connect the basal surface of epithelial cells to the basal lamina via the ECM molecule laminin. Some integrins, however, interact with intermediate filaments. The cytosolic domain of the $\beta 4$ chain in the $\alpha 6 \beta 4$ integrin in hemidesmosomes (see Figure 20-1), which is much longer than the cytosolic domains of other integrin $\beta$ chains, binds to specialized adapter proteins, which in turn interact with keratin-based intermediate filaments (see Table 20-4). Other integrins (for example, $\alpha 3 \beta 1$ ) are the adhesion receptors in the focal contacts linking the epithelial basal lamina with the actin cytoskeleton (see Figure 20-1).

As we will see, the diversity of integrins and their ECM ligands allows integrins to participate in a wide array of key biological processes, including the inflammatory response and the migration of cells to their correct locations during morphogenesis. The importance of integrins in diverse processes is highlighted by the defects exhibited by knockout mice engineered to have mutations in various integrin subunit genes. These defects include major abnormalities in development, blood vessel formation, leukocyte function, inflammation, bone remodeling, and blood clotting. Despite their differences, all these processes depend on integrin-mediated interactions between the cytoskeleton and either the ECM or CAMs on other cells.

In addition to their adhesion function, integrins can mediate outside-in and inside-out signaling (see Figure 20-8). The engagement of integrins by their extracellular ligands can, through adapter proteins bound to the integrin's cytosolic region, influence the cytoskeleton and intracellular signaling pathways (outside-in signaling). Conversely, intracellular signaling pathways can alter the structure of integrins and consequently their abilities to adhere to their extracellular ligands and mediate cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions (inside-out signaling). Integrin-mediated signaling pathways influence processes as diverse as cell survival, cell proliferation, and programmed cell death (see Chapter 21).

## Tight Junctions Seal Off Body Cavities and Restrict Diffusion of Membrane Components

For polarized epithelial cells to function as barriers and mediators of selective transport, extracellular fluids surrounding their apical and basolateral membranes must be kept separate. Tight junctions between adjacent epithelial cells are usually located in a band surrounding the cell just below the apical surface (Figure 20-17; see also Figure 2011). These specialized junctions form a barrier that seals off body cavities such as the intestinal lumen and separates the blood from the cerebral spinal fluid of the central nervous system (i.e., the blood-brain barrier).

The fracture plane passes through the plasma membrane of one of the two adjacent cells (see also Figure 20-11). A honeycomb-like network of ridges and grooves below the microvilli constitutes the tight-junction zone. (b) Schematic drawing shows how a tight junction might be formed by the linkage of rows of protein particles in adjacent cells. In the inset micrograph of an ultrathin sectional view of a tight junction, the adjacent cells can be seen in close contact where the rows of proteins interact. See L. A. Staehelin and B. E. Hull, 1978, Sci. Am. 238:140, and D. Goodenough, 1999, P. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:319. [Part (a) courtesy of L. Andrew Staehelin.

Tight junctions prevent the diffusion of macromolecules and, to varying degrees, small water-soluble molecules and ions across an epithelium via the spaces between cells. They also help establish and maintain the polarity of epithelial cells by preventing the diffusion of membrane proteins and glycolipids between the apical and the basolateral regions of the plasma membrane, ensuring that these regions contain different membrane components. Indeed, the lipid compositions of the apical and basolateral regions of the plasma membrane's exoplasmic leaflet (see Chapter 7) are distinct. Essentially all cell surface glycolipids are restricted to the exoplasmic face of the apical membrane, as are all proteins linked to the membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (see Figure 7-19). In contrast, the apical and basolateral regions of the plasma membrane's cytosolic leaflet have uniform membrane composition in epithelial cells; their lipids and proteins can apparently diffuse laterally from one region of the membrane to the other.

Tight junctions are composed of thin bands of plasmamembrane proteins that completely encircle the cell and are in contact with similar thin bands on adjacent cells. When thin sections of the tight junctions in cells are viewed in an electron microscope, the lateral surfaces of adjacent cells appear to touch each other at intervals and even to fuse in the zone just below the apical surface (see Figure 20-11b). In freeze-fracture preparations, tight junctions appear as an interlocking network of ridges and grooves in the plasma membrane (Figure 20-17a). Very high magnification reveals that rows of protein particles $3-4 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter form the ridges seen in freeze-fracture micrographs of tight junctions. In the model shown in Figure 20-17b, the tight junction is formed by a double row of these particles, one row donated by each cell. Treatment of an epithelium with the protease trypsin destroys the tight junctions, supporting the proposal that proteins are essential structural components of these junctions.

The two principal integral membrane proteins found in tight junctions are occludin and claudin (from the Latin claudere, "to close"). When investigators engineered mice with mutations inactivating the occludin gene, which was thought to be essential for tight-junction formation, the mice surprisingly still had morphologically distinct tight junctions. Further analysis led to the discovery of claudin. Each of these proteins has four membrane-spanning $\alpha$ helices (Figure 20-18). The mammalian claudin gene family encodes at least 27 homologous proteins that exhibit distinct tissuespecific patterns of expression. A group of junction adhesion molecules (JAMs) have also been found to contribute to homophilic adhesion and other functions of tight junctions. JAMs and another junctional protein, the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR), contain a single transmembrane $\alpha$ helix and belong to the Ig superfamily of CAMs. The extracellular domains of rows of occludin, claudin, and JAMs in the plasma membrane of one cell apparently form extremely tight links with similar rows of the same proteins in an adjacent cell, creating a tight seal. $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent cadherin-mediated adhesion also plays an important role in tight-junction formation, stability, and function.

FIGURE 20-18 Proteins that compose tight junctions.
(a) Immunofluorescence localization of occludin (green) and tricellulin (red) in mouse intestinal epithelium. Note that tricellulin is predominantly concentrated in tricellular junctions. (b) The junction adhesion molecule (JAM) has a single transmembrane domain and an extracellular region with two immunoglobulin domains, whereas occludin and claudins contain four transmembrane helices. The larger extracellular loop of the claudins, indicated by an asterisk, contributes to paracellular ion selectivity. The transmembrane helices of claudin-15, which permits paracellular transport of cations, form a four-helix bundle, and the extracellular loops contain a five-stranded $\beta$ sheet (seen edgewise in this view). This $\beta$ sheet has been proposed to help define the pore through which ions pass (near the asterisk). See S. Tsukita et al., 2001, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2:285. [Part (a) ©(2005, Ikenouchi J., et al., J. Cell Biol. 171(6):939-45. doi: 10.1083/jcb.200510043; Figure 3A. Part (b) structure of claudin-15 from H. Suzuki et al., 2014, Science 344:304-307, PDB ID 4p79.]

At the intersection of three cells connected to one another by tight junctions (see Figure 20-13 and Figure 20-18a), two additional transmembrane proteins are incorporated into the tight junctions: tricellulin, which has four membranespanning helices, as do occludin and claudins, and angulins, which have a single transmembrane helix and one extracellular immunoglobulin domain and which appear to be required for the assembly of tricellulin where the cells intersect.

As is the case for adherens junctions and desmosomes, cytosolic adapter proteins and their connections to the cytoskeleton are critical components of tight junctions. For example, the long C-terminal cytosolic segment of occludin binds to PDZ domains in some large, multidomain adapter proteins. PDZ domains are about 80 to 90 amino acids long and are found in various cytosolic proteins; they mediate

binding to other cytosolic proteins or to the C-termini of particular plasma-membrane proteins. Cytosolic proteins containing a PDZ domain often have more than one of them. In the human genome, there are more than 250 PDZ domains in hundreds of proteins. Proteins with multiple PDZ domains can serve as scaffolds on which to assemble proteins into larger functional complexes. Several multiple-PDZ-do-main-containing adapter proteins are associated with tight junctions, including the zonula occludens (ZO) proteins ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3, which not only interact with occludin, claudin, and other adapter and signaling proteins but also mediate association with actin fibers. These interactions appear to stabilize the linkage between occludin and claudin molecules that is essential for maintaining the integrity of tight junctions. ZO proteins can also function as adapters for adherens junctions (see Figure 20-14) and gap junctions.

A simple experiment demonstrates the impermeability of tight junctions to some water-soluble substances. In this experiment, lanthanum hydroxide (an electron-dense colloid of high molecular weight) is injected into the pancreatic blood vessel of an experimental animal; a few minutes later, the pancreatic epithelial acinar cells are fixed and prepared for microscopy. As shown in Figure 20-19, the lanthanum hydroxide diffuses from the blood into the space that separates the lateral surfaces of adjacent acinar cells, but cannot penetrate past the tight junction.

As a consequence of tight junctions, many nutrients cannot move across the intestinal epithelium between cells; instead, their transport is achieved in large part through the transcellular pathway via specific membrane-bound transport proteins (Figure 20-20; see also Figure 11-30).

S. and Gilula, N. B., J. Cell Biol. 53(3):758-776.)

FIGURE 20-20 Transcellular and paracellular pathways of transepithelial transport. Transcellular transport requires the cellular uptake of molecules on one side and subsequent release on the opposite side by mechanisms discussed in Chapter 11. In paracellular transport, molecules move extracellularly through parts of tight junctions, whose permeability to small molecules and ions depends on the composition of the junctional components and the physiological state of the epithelial cells. See S. Tsukita et al., 2001, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2:285.

The barrier to diffusion provided by tight junctions, however, is not absolute, for they exhibit size- and ion-selective permeability. Thus certain small molecules and ions can move from one side of the epithelium to the other through the paracellular pathway (see Figure 20-20). The importance of selective permeability is highlighted by the evolutionary conservation of the molecules that establish it and the diseases that arise when it is disrupted. For example, murine embryos cannot develop properly if selective permeability is disrupted because proper fluid balance on the two sides of epithelia cannot be maintained. Similarly, the kidneys depend on proper tight-junction permeability to establish the ion gradients necessary for normal regulation of body fluids and waste removal. Owing at least in part to the varying properties of the different types of claudin molecules located in different tight junctions, the permeability of the tight junctions to ions, small molecules, and water varies enormously among different epithelial tissues. The large extracellular loop in the claudins (see Figure 20-18) is thought to play a major role in defining the selective permeability conferred on tight junctions by specific claudin isoforms.

The permeability of tight junctions can be altered by intracellular signaling pathways, especially G protein and cyclic AMP-coupled pathways (see Chapter 15). The regulation of tight-junction permeability is often studied by measuring ion flux (electrical resistance, called transepithelial resistance) or the movement of radioactive or fluorescent molecules across monolayers of MDCK or other epithelial cells.

The importance of paracellular transport is apparent in several human diseases. In hereditary hypomagnesemia, a defect in the claudin16 gene prevents the normal paracellular flow of magnesium in the kidney. This defect results in an abnormally low blood level of magnesium, which can lead to convulsions. Furthermore, a mutation in the claudin14 gene causes hereditary deafness, apparently by altering transport around hair-cell epithelia in the cochlea of the inner ear.

Some pathogens have evolved to exploit the molecules in tight junctions. Some use junctional proteins as "co-receptors" to attach to cells prior to infecting them (e.g., hepatitis C virus uses claudin-1 and occludin, together with two other co-receptors, to enter liver cells). Others break down the tight-junction barrier and cross epithelia via paracellular movement, and still others produce toxins that alter barrier function. For example, toxins produced by Vibrio cholerae, the enteric bacterium that causes cholera, alter the permeability barrier of the intestinal epithelium by altering the composition or activity of tight junctions. Vibrio cholerae also releases a protease that disrupts tight junctions by degrading the extracellular domain of occludin. Other bacterial toxins can affect the ion-pumping activity of membrane transport proteins in intestinal epithelial cells. Toxin-induced changes in tight-junction permeability (increased paracellular transport) and in protein-mediated ion pumping (increased transcellular transport) can result in massive losses of internal body ions and water into the gastrointestinal tract, which in turn leads to diarrhea and potentially lethal dehydration (see Chapter 11).

## Gap Junctions Composed of Connexins Allow Small Molecules to Pass Directly Between the Cytosols of Adjacent Cells

Early electron micrographs of tissues revealed sites of cell-cell contact with a characteristic intercellular gap (Figure 20-21a). This feature, which was found in virtually all animal cells that contact other cells, prompted early morphologists to call these regions gap junctions. In retrospect, the most important feature of these junctions is not the $2-4-\mathrm{nm}$ gap itself, but a well-defined set of cylindrical particles that cross the gap and compose pores connecting the cytosols of adjacent cells (Figure 20-21b, c). As we will see later in this chapter, plant cells also assemble pores that connect the cytosols of adjacent cells, but those channels, called plasmodesmata, differ considerably in structure from gap junctions. Tunneling nanotubes are relatively recently discovered membrane-bound tubes that connect the cytoplasms of animal cells. Because they are more similar to plasmodesmata than to gap junctions, they will be discussed with plasmodesmata.

In many animal tissues, anywhere from a few to thousands of gap-junction particles cluster together in patches (e.g., along the lateral surfaces of epithelial cells; see Figure 20-11). When the plasma membrane is purified and then sheared into small fragments, some pieces mainly containing patches of gap junctions are generated. Owing to their relatively high protein content, these fragments have a higher density than the bulk of the plasma membrane and can be purified by equilibrium density-gradient centrifugation (see Figure 4-37). When these preparations are viewed perpendicular to the membrane, the gap junctions appear as arrays of hexagonal particles that enclose water-filled channels (see Figure 20-21b).

The effective pore size of gap junctions can be measured by injecting a cell with a fluorescent dye covalently linked to membrane bilayer-impermeable molecules of various sizes and observing with a fluorescence microscope whether the
dye passes into neighboring cells. Gap junctions between mammalian cells permit the passage of molecules as large as 1.2 nm in diameter. In insects, these junctions are permeable to molecules as large as 2 nm in diameter. Generally speaking, molecules smaller than 1200 Da pass freely and those larger than 2000 Da do not pass; the passage of inter-mediate-sized molecules is variable and limited. Thus ions, many low-molecular-weight precursors of cellular macromolecules, products of intermediary metabolism, and small intracellular signaling molecules can pass from cell to cell through gap junctions.

In neural tissue, some neurons are connected by gap junctions through which ions pass rapidly, thereby allowing very rapid transmission of electrical signals. Impulse transmission through these connections, called electrical synapses, is almost a thousand times as rapid as at chemical synapses (see Chapter 22). Gap junctions are also present in many non-neural tissues, where they help to integrate the electrical and metabolic activities of many cells. In the heart, for instance, gap junctions rapidly pass ionic signals among cardiac muscle cells, which are tightly bound together via desmosomes. Thus gap junctions contribute to the electrically stimulated coordinate contraction of cardiac muscle cells during a heartbeat. As discussed in Chapter 15, some extracellular hormonal signals induce the production or release of small intracellular signaling molecules called second messengers (e.g., cyclic AMP, $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ) that regulate cellular metabolism. Because many second messengers can be transferred between cells through gap junctions, hormonal stimulation of one cell has the potential of triggering a coordinated response by that cell as well as many of its neighbors. Such gap-junction-mediated signaling plays an important role, for example, in the secretion of digestive enzymes by the pancreas and in the coordinated muscular contractile waves (peristalsis) in the intestine. Another vivid example of gap-junction-mediated transport is the phenomenon of metabolic coupling, or metabolic cooperation, in which a cell transfers nutrients or intermediary metabolites to a neighboring cell that is itself unable to synthesize them. Gap junctions play critical roles in the development of egg precursors (oocytes) in the ovary by mediating the movement of both metabolites and signaling molecules, such as cyclic GMP, between an oocyte and its surrounding granulosa cells, as well as between neighboring granulosa cells.

A current model of the structure of the gap junction is shown in Figure 20-21c-d. Vertebrate gap junctions are composed of connexins, a family of structurally related transmembrane proteins with molecular weights between 26,000 and 60,000 . Each vertebrate hexagonal particle consists of twelve noncovalently associated connexin molecules: six form a cylindrical hemichannel, called a connexion, in one plasma membrane that is joined to a connexion in the adjacent cell membrane, forming a continuous aqueous channel (diameter $\sim 14 \AA$ ) between the cells. Each individual connexin molecule has four membrane-spanning $\alpha$ helices with a topology similar to that of claudin (see Figure 20-18), resulting in 24 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices in each connexion hemichannel.

Right: View from the cytosol perpendicular to the membrane bilayers, looking down on the connexion with its central pore. The diameter of the pore's channel is $\sim 14 \AA$, and it is lined by many polar/charged amino acids. See S. Nakagawa et al., 2010, Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 20(4):423-430. [Part (a) courtesy of D. Goodenough. Part (b) 01977 Caspar, D. L., J. Cell Biol., 1977, 74:605-628. doi:10.1083/jcb.74.2.605; Figure 2b. Part (d) data from S. Maeda et al., 2009, Nature 458:597-602, PDB ID 2zw3.]

A completely different family of proteins, the innexins, forms the gap junctions in invertebrates. A third family of innexin-like proteins, called pannexins, has been found in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Pannexins form hexamer hemichannels (pannexons) whose opening can be regulated by changes in membrane potential or mechanical stress. When open, pannexons permit direct exchange of small molecules (such as ATP) and ions between the intracellular and extracellular spaces. Pannexons are thought to play key roles in release of ATP from cells into the extracellular space. Extracellular ATP (as well as ADP and AMP) can function as an intercellular messenger or transmitter by binding to and activating the cell-surface purinergic receptors P1, P2X, or P2Y on target cells.

There are 21 different connexin genes in humans, and different sets of connexins are expressed in different cell types. The existence of this diversity, together with the generation of mutant mice with inactivating mutations in connexin genes, has highlighted the importance of connexins in a wide variety of cellular systems. Some cells express a single connexin that forms homotypic connexons. Most cells, however, express at least two connexins; these different proteins can assemble into heteromeric connexons, which in turn form heterotypic gap-junction channels. Diversity in channel composition leads to differences in channel permeability. For example, channels made from a $43-\mathrm{kDa}$ connexin isoform, Cx43-the most ubiquitously expressed connexinare more than a hundred times as permeable to ADP and ATP as those made from Cx 32 ( 32 kDa ).

The permeability of gap junctions is regulated by posttranslational modification of connexins (e.g., phosphorylation) and is sensitive to changes in environmental conditions such as intracellular pH and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration, membrane potential, and the intercellular potential between adjacent interconnected cells ("voltage gating"). The N-termini of connexins appear to be especially important in the gating mechanism. Thus, as is the case for many ion channels (see Chapter 11), the channel in some gap junctions can be either opened or closed. One example of the physiological regulation of gap junctions occurs during mammalian childbirth. The smooth muscle cells in the mammalian uterus must contract strongly and synchronously during labor to expel the fetus. To facilitate this coordinated activity, immediately before and during labor there is an approximately five- to tenfold increase in the amount of the major connexin in these cells, Cx43, and an increase in the number and size of gap junctions, which is reversed rapidly postpartum (following childbirth).

The assembly of connexins, their trafficking within cells, and the formation of functional gap junctions apparently depend on N -cadherin and its associated adapter proteins (e.g., $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-catenins, ZO-1, and ZO-2) as well as desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, desmoplakin, and plakophilin-2). PDZ domains in ZO-1 and ZO-2 bind to the C-terminus of Cx43 and mediate its interaction with catenins and N -cadherin. The relevance of these relationships is particularly evident in the heart, which depends on gap junctions for rapid coordinated electrical coupling and on adjacent adherens junctions and desmosomes for mechanical coupling
between cardiomyocytes to achieve the intercellular integration of electrical activity and movement required for normal cardiac function. It is noteworthy that ZO-1 serves as an adapter for adherens (see Figure 20-14), tight, and gap junctions, suggesting that this and other adapters can help integrate the formation and functions of these diverse junctions.

Mutations in connexin genes cause at least eight human diseases, including neurosensory deafness (Cx26 and Cx31), cataracts or heart malformations (Cx43, Cx46, and Cx50), and the X-linked form of Charcot-MarieTooth disease (Cx32), which is marked by progressive degeneration of peripheral nerves.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 20.2

## Cell-Cell and Cell-Extracellular Matrix Junctions and Their Adhesion Molecules

- Epithelial cells have distinct apical, basal, and lateral surfaces. Microvilli projecting from the apical surfaces of many epithelial cells considerably expand the cells' surface areas.
- Three major classes of cell junctions-anchoring junctions, tight junctions, and gap junctions-assemble epithelial cells into sheets and mediate communication between them (see Figures 20-1 and 20-11). Anchoring junctions can be further subdivided into adherens junctions, focal contacts, desmosomes, and hemidesmosomes.
- Adherens junctions and desmosomes are cadherin-containing anchoring junctions that bind the membranes of adjacent cells, giving strength and rigidity to the entire tissue.
- Cadherins are cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs) responsible for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent interactions among cells in epithelial and other tissues. They promote strong cell-cell adhesion by mediating both lateral intracellular (cis) and adhesive intercellular (trans) interactions.
- Adapter proteins that bind to the cytosolic domain of cadherins, other CAMs, and adhesion receptors mediate the association of cytoskeletal and signaling molecules with the plasma membrane (see Figures 20-8 and 20-14). Strong cell-cell adhesion depends on the linkage of the interacting CAMs to the cytoskeleton.
- Hemidesmosomes are integrin-containing anchoring junctions that attach cells to elements of the underlying extracellular matrix.
- Integrins are a large family of $\alpha \beta$ heterodimeric cell-surface proteins that mediate both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions and inside-out and outside-in signaling in numerous tissues.
- Tight junctions block the diffusion of proteins and some lipids in the plane of the plasma membrane, contributing to the polarity of epithelial cells. They also limit and regulate the extracellular (paracellular) flow of water and solutes from one side of the epithelium to the other (see Figure 20-20).

Two key integral membrane proteins found in tight junctions are occludin and claudin.

- Gap junctions are constructed of multiple copies of connexin proteins, which are assembled into a transmembrane channel that connects the cytosols of two adjacent cells (see Figure 20-21). Small molecules and ions can pass through gap junctions, permitting metabolic and electrical coupling of adjacent cells.


### 20.3 The Extracellular Matrix I: The Basal Lamina

In animals, the extracellular matrix (ECM) has multiple functions (see Table 20-2). The ECM helps organize cells into tissues and coordinates their cellular functions by activating intracellular signaling pathways that control cell growth, proliferation, and gene expression. The ECM can directly influence cell and tissue structure and function. In addition, it can serve as a repository for inactive or inaccessible signaling molecules (e.g., growth factors) that are released to function when the ECM is disassembled or remodeled by hydrolyases, such as proteases. Indeed, hydrolyzed fragments of ECM macromolecules can themselves have independent biological activity. The ensemble of proteins that compose the ECM itself and associated proteins that covalently modify (e.g., chemically cross-link, phosphorylate, cleave), bind to, or otherwise regulate the composition and structure of the ECM is called the matrisome. Proteomic (Chapter 3) and genomic analyses suggest that there are approximately 1030 and 1110 genes that encode the human and mouse matrisomes, respectively. Dysfunction of matrisome components can cause a wide variety of diseases that affect many different tissues and organs. It is noteworthy that there are ECM components, as well as extracellular domains of plasmamembrane proteins, that are phosphorylated on serine, threonine, or tyrosine side chains. Kinases that are present in the luminal compartments of the secretory pathway and some that are apparently secreted into the extracellular space catalyze these phosphorylations.

Many functions of the ECM and, indeed, some features of the assembly of the ECM require transmembrane adhesion receptors, including the integrins, that bind directly to ECM components and that also interact, through adapter proteins, with the cytoskeleton. Adhesion receptors bind to three types of molecules abundant in the ECM of all tissues (see Table 20-1):

- Proteoglycans, a group of glycoproteins that cushion cells and bind a wide variety of extracellular molecules
- Collagen fibers, which provide structural integrity, mechanical strength, and resilience
- Soluble multi-adhesive matrix proteins, such as laminin and fibronectin, which bind to and cross-link adhesion receptors and other ECM components

We begin our description of the structures and functions of these major ECM components in the context of the basal lamina: the specialized sheet of ECM that plays a particularly important role in determining the overall architecture and function of epithelial tissues. In the following section, we discuss the ECM molecules commonly found in nonepithelial tissues, including connective tissue.

## The Basal Lamina Provides a Foundation for Assembly of Cells into Tissues

In animals, most organized groups of cells in epithelial and nonepithelial tissues are underlain or surrounded by the basal lamina, a sheet-like meshwork of ECM components usually no more than $60-120 \mathrm{~nm}$ thick (Figure 20-22). The basal lamina is structured differently in different tissues. In columnar and other epithelia such as intestinal lining and skin, it is a foundation on which only one surface of the cells rests. In other tissues, such as muscle or fat, the basal lamina surrounds each cell. Basal laminae play important roles in regeneration after tissue damage and in embryonic development. For instance, the basal lamina helps four- and eight-celled embryos adhere together in a ball. In the development of the nervous system, neurons migrate along ECM pathways that contain basal laminal components. In higher animals, two distinct basal laminae are employed to form a tight barrier that limits diffusion of molecules between the blood and the brain (blood-brain barrier), and in the kidney, a specialized basal lamina serves as a selectively permeable blood filter. In muscle, the basal lamina helps protect the cell membranes from damage during contraction and relaxation. Thus the basal lamina is important for organizing cells into tissues and distinct compartments, repairing tissues, forming permeability barriers, and guiding migrating cells during development. It is therefore not surprising that its components have been highly conserved throughout evolution.

Most of the ECM components in the basal lamina are synthesized by the cells that rest on it. Four ubiquitous protein components, each of which comprises multiple, distinct, repeating domains, are found in basal laminae (Figure 20-23):

- Type IV collagen, trimeric molecules with both rodlike and globular domains that form a two-dimensional network
- Laminins, a family of multi-adhesive, cross-shaped proteins that form a fibrous two-dimensional network with type IV collagen and that also bind to integrins and other adhesion receptors
- Perlecan, a large multidomain proteoglycan that binds to and cross-links many ECM components and cell-surface molecules
- Nidogen (also called entactin), a rodlike molecule that cross-links type IV collagen, perlecan, and laminin, which helps incorporate other components into the ECM and also stabilizes basal laminae.

FIGURE 20-23 Major protein components of the basal lamina. Type IV collagen and laminin each form two-dimensional networks (see Figures 20-24 and 20-26), which are cross-linked by
nidogen/entactin and perlecan molecules and which interact via laminins with the plasma membranes of adjacent cells.

Other ECM molecules, such as members of the evolutionarily ancient family of glycoproteins called fibulins, are incorporated into various basal laminae, depending on the tissue and the particular functional requirements of the basal lamina.

As depicted in Figure 20-1, one side of the basal lamina is linked to cells by adhesion receptors, including integrins
in hemidesmosomes, which bind to laminin in the basal lamina. The other side of the basal lamina is anchored to the adjacent connective tissue by a layer of collagen fibers embedded in a proteoglycan-rich matrix. In stratified squamous epithelia (e.g., skin; see Figure 20-10d), this linkage is mediated by anchoring fibrils of type VII

collagen. Together, the basal lamina and the anchoring collagen fibrils form the structure called the basement membrane.

## Laminin, a Multi-adhesive Matrix Protein, Helps Cross-Link Components of the Basal Lamina

Laminin, the principal multi-adhesive matrix protein in basal laminae, is a heterotrimeric protein comprising $\alpha, \beta$, and $\gamma$ chains. At least 16 laminin isoforms in vertebrates are assembled from $5 \alpha, 3 \beta$, and $3 \gamma$ chains, with each chain numbered to reflect the chain composition: laminin-111 $(\alpha 1 \beta 1 \gamma 1)$ or laminin-511 $(\alpha 5 \beta 1 \gamma 1)$. Each laminin isoform exhibits a distinctive pattern of tissue- and developmental stage-specific expression. As shown in Figure 20-24, many
laminins are large, cross-shaped proteins (molecular weight of about 820,000 ), although some are Y or rod shaped. Globular domains at the N -terminus of each subunit bind to one another and thus mediate the self-assembly of laminins into mesh-like networks. Five globular LG domains at the C-terminus of the laminin $\alpha$ subunit mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent binding to cell-surface laminin receptors, including certain integrins (see Table 20-4) as well as sulfated glycolipids, syndecan, and dystroglycan, which will be described further in Section 20.4. Some of these interactions are via negatively charged carbohydrates on the receptors. LG domains are found in a wide variety of other proteins and can mediate binding to steroids and proteins as well as carbohydrates. Laminin is the principal basal laminal ligand of integrins.

## Sheet-Forming Type IV Collagen Is a Major Structural Component of the Basal Lamina

Type IV collagen is, together with laminin, a principal structural component of all basal laminae and can bind to adhesion receptors, including some integrins. Collagen IV is one of at least 28 types of collagen in humans that participate in the formation of distinct ECMs in various tissues (Table 20-5). There are also at least 20 additional collagen-like proteins (such as host defense collagens) in the human proteome. Although collagen isoforms differ in certain structural features and in their tissue distribution, all collagens are trimeric proteins made from three polypeptides, each encoded by one of at least 43 genes in humans, usually called collagen $\alpha$ chains. The three $\alpha$ chains in a collagen molecule can be identical (forming a homotrimer) or different (forming a heterotrimer). All or parts of the three-stranded collagen molecule can twist together into a special triple helix
called a collagenous triple helix. When there is more than one triple-helical segment, these segments are joined by nonhelical regions of the protein, as we will see shortly for type IV collagen. Within a helical segment, each of the three $\alpha$ chains twists into a left-handed helix, and the three chains then wrap around one another to form a right-handed triple helix (Figure 20-25).

The collagen triple helix can form because of an unusual abundance of three amino acids in the $\alpha$ chains: glycine, proline, and a modified form of proline called hydroxyproline (see Figure 2-15). They make up the characteristic repeating sequence motif Gly-X-Y, where X and Y can be any amino acid but are often proline in position X and hydroxyproline in position Y, and less often lysine and hydroxylysine. Glycine is essential because its small side chain, a hydrogen atom, is the only one that can fit into the crowded center of the threestranded helix (see Figure 20-25b). Hydrogen bonds help hold the three chains together. Although the rigid peptidyl-proline

and peptidyl-hydroxyproline linkages are not compatible with formation of a classic single-stranded $\alpha$ helix, they stabilize the distinctive collagenous triple helix. The hydroxyl group in hydroxyproline in the Y position helps hold its ring in a conformation that stabilizes the three-stranded helix.

There are several distinct cell-surface receptors for collagen IV and other types of collagen (other collagens are discussed in the next section). These cell-surface receptors include certain integrins, discoidin domain receptors 1 and 2 (which are tyrosine kinase receptors), glycoprotein VI (on platelets), leukocyte-associated Ig-like receptor-1, members of the mannose receptor family, and a modified form of the protein CD44. They can play critical roles in helping to assemble the ECM and in integrating cellular activity with the ECM.

The unique properties of each collagen isoform are due mainly to differences in (1) the number and lengths of the collagenous triple-helical segments; (2) the segments that flank or interrupt the triple-helical segments and that fold into other kinds of three-dimensional structures; and (3) covalent modification of the $\alpha$ chains (e.g., hydroxylation, glycosylation, oxidation, cross-linking). For example, the chains in type IV collagen are designated IV $\alpha$ chains. Mammals express six homologous IV $\alpha$ chains, which assemble into three different heterotrimeric type IV collagens with distinct properties. All subtypes of type IV collagen, however, form a 400-nm-long triple helix (Figure 20-26) that is interrupted

The collagenous triple helix is interrupted by nonhelical segments that introduce flexible kinks into the molecule. Lateral interactions between triplehelical segments, as well as head-to-head and tail-to-tail interactions between the globular domains, form dimers, tetramers, and higherorder complexes, yielding a sheet-like network. Multiple, unusual sulfilimine ( $-S=N-$ ) or thioether bonds between hydroxylysine (or lysine) and methionine residues covalently cross-link some adjacent C-terminal domains and contribute to the stability of the network. See A. Boutaud, 2000, J. Biol. Chem. 275:30716. (b) Electron micrograph of type IV collagen network formed in vitro.

about 24 times by nonhelical segments and flanked by a large globular domain at the C-terminus of the chain and a smaller globular domain at the N -terminus. The nonhelical regions introduce flexibility into the molecule. Through both lateral associations and interactions entailing the globular N - and C-termini, type IV collagen molecules assemble into a branching, irregular two-dimensional fibrous network that forms a lattice on which, together with the laminin lattice, the basal lamina is built (see Figures 20-23 and 20-26).

■In the kidney, a double basal lamina called the glomerular basement membrane separates the epithelium that lines the urinary space from the endothelium that lines the surrounding blood-filled capillaries. Defects in this structure, which is responsible for ultrafiltration of the blood and initial urine formation, can lead to renal failure. For instance, mutations that alter the C-terminal globular domain of certain IV $\alpha$ chains are associated with progressive renal failure as well as sensorineural hearing loss and ocular abnormalities, a condition known as Alport's syndrome. In Goodpasture's syndrome, a relatively rare autoimmune disease, antibodies bind to the $\alpha 3$ chains of type IV collagen found in the glomerular basement membrane and lungs. This binding sets off an immune response that causes cellular damage, resulting in progressive renal failure and pulmonary hemorrhage.

## Perlecan, a Proteoglycan, Cross-Links Components of the Basal Lamina and Cell-Surface Receptors

Perlecan, the major secreted proteoglycan in basal laminae, consists of a large multidomain core protein ( $\sim 470$ kDa ) to which polysaccharides are covalently attached. The core protein is made up of multiple repeats of five distinct domains, including laminin-like LG domains (3 copies), EGF-like domains ( 12 copies), and Ig domains ( 22 copies). The many globular repeats give it the appearance of an approximately 200 -nm-long string of pearls when visualized by electron microscopy; hence the name perlecan. Perlecan contains three types of covalent polysaccharide chains: N -linked chains (see Chapter 14), O-linked chains, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (O-linked sugars and GAGs are discussed further in Section 20.4). GAGs are long, linear polymers of repeating disaccharides. Glycoproteins containing covalently attached GAG chains are called proteoglycans. Both the protein and the GAG components of perlecan contribute to its ability to incorporate into and define the structure and function of basal laminae. Because its multiple domains and its polysaccharide chains have distinct binding properties, perlecan binds to dozens of other molecules, including other ECM components (e.g., laminin, nidogen/ entactin), cell-surface receptors, and polypeptide growth factors. Simultaneous binding to these molecules results in perlecan-mediated cross-linking. Perlecan can be found in
basal laminae and in non-basal laminal ECM. The adhesion receptor dystroglycan can bind perlecan directly, via perlecan's LG domains, and indirectly, via its binding to laminin. In humans, mutations in the perlecan gene can lead either to dwarfism or to muscle abnormalities, apparently due to dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction that controls muscle firing.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 20.3

## The Extracellular Matrix I: The Basal Lamina

- The matrisome is the ensemble of proteins that compose the ECM itself and associated proteins that covalently modify (e.g., chemically cross-link, phosphorylate, cleave) the ECM.
- The basal lamina, a thin meshwork of ECM molecules, separates most epithelia and other organized groups of cells from adjacent connective tissue. Together, the basal lamina and the immediately adjacent collagen network form a structure called the basement membrane.
- Four ECM proteins are found in all basal laminae (see Figure 20-23): laminin (a multi-adhesive matrix protein), type IV collagen, perlecan (a proteoglycan), and nidogen/ entactin.
- Adhesion receptors such as integrin anchor cells to the basal lamina, which in turn is connected to other ECM components (see Figure 20-1). Laminin in the basal lamina is the principal ligand of $\alpha 6 \beta 4$ integrin (see Table 20-4).
- Laminin and other multi-adhesive matrix proteins are multidomain molecules that bind multiple adhesion receptors and ECM components.
- The large, flexible molecules of type IV collagen interact end to end and laterally to form a mesh-like scaffold to which other ECM components and adhesion receptors can bind (see Figures 20-23 and 20-26).
- Type IV collagen is a member of the collagen family of proteins, which is distinguished by the presence of repeating tripeptide sequences of Gly-X-Y that give rise to the collagen triple-helical structure (see Figure 20-25). Different collagens are distinguished by the length and chemical modifications of their $\alpha$ chains and by the presence or absence of segments that interrupt or flank their triple-helical regions.
- Perlecan, a large, multidomain, secreted proteoglycan that is present primarily in basal laminae, binds many ECM components and adhesion receptors. Proteoglycans consist of membrane-associated or secreted core proteins covalently linked to one or more specialized polysaccharide chains called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs).

### 20.4 The Extracellular Matrix II: Connective Tissue

Connective tissue, such as tendon and cartilage, differs from other solid tissues in that most of its volume is made up of extracellular matrix rather than cells. This ECM is packed with insoluble protein fibers. ECM in connective tissue has several key components, some of which are found in other types of tissues as well:

- Collagens, trimeric molecules that are often bundled together into fibers (fibrillar collagens)
- Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), specialized linear polysaccharide chains of specific repeating disaccharides that can be highly hydrated and confer diverse binding and physical properties (e.g., resistance to compression)
- Proteoglycans, glycoproteins containing one or more covalently bound GAG chains
- Multi-adhesive proteins, large multidomain proteins often comprising many copies ("repeats") of a few distinctive domains that bind to and cross-link a variety of adhesion receptors and ECM components
- Elastin, a protein that forms the amorphous core of elastic fibers

Collagen is the most abundant fibrous protein in connective tissue. Rubber-like elastin fibers, which can be stretched and relaxed, are also present in deformable sites (e.g., skin, tendons, heart). The fibronectins, a family of multi-adhesive matrix proteins, form their own distinct fibrils in the ECM of most connective tissues. Although several types of cells are found in connective tissues, the various ECM components are produced largely by cells called fibroblasts. In this section, we explore the structure and function of the various ECM components in connective tissue, and we see how the ECM is degraded and remodeled by a variety of specialized proteases.

## Fibrillar Collagens Are the Major Fibrous Proteins in the ECM of Connective Tissues

About 80-90 percent of the collagen in the body consists of fibrillar collagens (types I, II, and III), located primarily in connective tissues (see Table 20-5). Because of its abundance in ten-don-rich tissue such as rat tail, type I collagen is easy to isolate and was the first collagen to be characterized. Its fundamental structural unit is a long (300-nm), thin (1.5-nm-diameter) triple helix (see Figure 20-25) consisting of two $\alpha 1$ (I) chains and one $\alpha 2$ (I) chain, each 1050 amino acids in length. The triplestranded molecules pack tightly together and wrap around one another, forming microfibrils that associate into higher-order polymers called collagen fibrils, which in turn often aggregate into larger bundles called collagen fibers (Figure 20-27).

Classes of collagen that are less abundant, but nevertheless important, include fibril-associated collagens, which
link the fibrillar collagens to one another or to other ECM components; sheet-forming and anchoring collagens, which form two-dimensional networks in basal laminae (type IV) and connect the basal lamina in skin to the underlying connective tissue (type VII); transmembrane collagens, which function as adhesion receptors; and host defense collagens, which help the body recognize and eliminate pathogens. Interestingly, several collagens (e.g., types IX, XVIII, and XV) are also proteoglycans with covalently attached GAGs (see Table 20-5).

## Fibrillar Collagen Is Secreted and Assembled into Fibrils Outside the Cell

Fibrillar collagens are secreted proteins, produced primarily by fibroblasts in the ECM. Collagen biosynthesis and secretion follow the normal pathway for a secreted protein, described in detail in Chapters 13 and 14. The collagen $\alpha$ chains are synthesized as longer precursors, called pro- $\alpha$ chains, by ribosomes attached to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The pro- $\alpha$ chains undergo a series of covalent modifications and fold into triple-helical procollagen molecules before their release from cells (see Figure 20-27).

After the secretion of procollagen from the cell, extracellular peptidases remove the N -terminal and C -terminal propeptides. The resulting molecules, which consist almost entirely of a triple-stranded helix because of long stretches of the characteristic collagen repeating sequence motif Gly-X-Y, associate laterally to generate fibrils with a diameter of $50-200 \mathrm{~nm}$. In fibrils, adjacent collagen molecules are displaced from one another by 67 nm , about one-quarter of their length. This staggered array produces a striated effect that can be seen in both light and electron microscopic images of collagen fibrils (see Figure 20-27, inset). The unique properties of the fibrillar collagens are mainly due to the formation of fibrils.

Short segments at either end of the fibrillar collagen $\alpha$ chains that are not composed of the repeating sequence motif Gly-X-Y, and thus are not triple-helical, are of particular importance in the formation of collagen fibrils. Lysine and hydroxylysine side chains in these segments are covalently modified by extracellular lysyl oxidases to form aldehydes in place of the amine group at the end of the side chain. These reactive aldehyde groups form covalent cross-links with lysine, hydroxylysine, and histidine residues in adjacent molecules. The cross-links stabilize the side-by-side packing of collagen molecules and generate a very strong fibril. The removal of the terminal propeptides and covalent cross-linking take place in the extracellular space to prevent the potentially catastrophic assembly of large fibrils within the cell.

The post-translational modifications of pro- $\alpha$ chains are crucial for the formation of mature collagen molecules and their assembly into fibrils. Defects in these modifications have serious consequences, which ancient mariners frequently experienced. For example, ascorbic acid (vitamin C)

Step Procollagen $\alpha$ chains are synthesized on ribosomes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum (rough ER), and in the ER, asparagine-linked oligosaccharides are added to the C-terminal propeptide. Step Propeptides associate to form trimers and are covalently linked by disulfide bonds, and selected residues in the Gly-X-Y triplet repeats are covalently modified [certain prolines and lysines are hydroxylated, galactose or galactose-glucose (hexagons) are attached to some hydroxylysines, prolines are cis $\rightarrow$ trans isomerized].

In cells deprived of ascorbate, as in the disease scurvy, the pro- $\alpha$ chains are not hydroxylated sufficiently to form stable triple-helical procollagen at normal body temperature, and the procollagen that forms cannot assemble into normal fibrils. Without the structural support of collagen, blood vessels, tendons, and skin become fragile. Fresh fruit in the diet can supply sufficient vitamin C to support the formation of normal collagen. Historically, British sailors were provided with limes to prevent scurvy, leading to their being called "limeys."

Step The fibrils can assemble into larger and larger bundles, some of which form the tendons that attach muscle to bone. See A. V. Persikov and B. Brodsky, 2002, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

## Type I and II Collagens Associate with Nonfibrillar Collagens to Form Diverse Structures

Collagens differ in the structures of the fibers they form and in how these fibers are organized into networks. Of the predominant types of collagen found in connective tissues, type I collagen forms long fibers, whereas networks of type II collagen are more mesh-like. In tendons, for instance, the long type I collagen fibers connect muscles to bones and must withstand enormous forces. Because type I collagen fibers have great tensile strength, tendons usually can be stretched without being broken. Indeed, gram for gram, type I collagen

is stronger than steel. Two quantitatively minor fibrillar collagens, type V and type XI, co-assemble into fibers with type I collagen, thereby regulating the structures and properties of the fibers. Incorporation of type V collagen, for example, results in smaller-diameter fibers.

Type I collagen fibrils are also used as the reinforcing rods in the construction of bone. Bones and teeth are hard and strong because they contain large amounts of dahllite, a crystalline calcium- and phosphate-containing mineral. Most bones are about 70 percent mineral and 30 percent protein, the vast majority of which is type I collagen. Bones form when certain cells (chondrocytes and osteoblasts) secrete collagen fibrils that are then mineralized by deposition of small dahllite crystals.

In many connective tissues, particularly skeletal muscle, proteoglycans and a fibril-associated collagen called type VI collagen are noncovalently bound to the sides of type I fibrils and may bind the fibrils together to form thicker collagen fibers (Figure 20-28a). Type VI collagen is unusual in that the molecule consists of a relatively short triple helix with globular domains at both ends. The lateral association of two type VI monomers generates an "antiparallel" dimer. The end-to-end association of these dimers through their globular

FIGURE 20-28 Interactions of fibrillar collagens with fibrilassociated collagens. (a) In tendons, type I fibrils are all oriented in the direction of the stress applied to the tendon. Proteoglycans and type VI collagen bind noncovalently to type I fibrils, coating the surface. The microfibrils of type VI collagen, which contain globular and triple-helical segments, bind to type I fibrils and link them together into thicker fibers. See R. R. Bruns et al., 1986, J. Cell Biol. 103:393. (b) In cartilage, type IX collagen molecules are covalently bound at regular intervals along type II fibrils. A chondroitin sulfate chain, covalently linked to the $\alpha 2(\mathrm{IX})$ chain at the flexible kink, projects outward from the fibril, as does the globular N-terminal region. See L. M. Shaw and B. Olson, 1991, Trends Biochem. Sci. 18:191.
domains forms type VI "microfibrils." These microfibrils have a beads-on-a-string appearance, with about 60 -nm-long triple-helical regions separated by 40 -nm-long globular domains.

The fibrils of type II collagen, the major collagen in cartilage, are smaller in diameter than type I fibrils and are oriented randomly in a viscous proteoglycan matrix. The rigid collagen fibrils impart strength to the matrix and allow it to resist large deformations. Type II fibrils are cross-linked to matrix proteoglycans by type IX collagen, another fibril-associated collagen. Type IX collagen and several related types have two or three triple-helical segments connected by flexible kinks and a globular N-terminal segment (Figure 20-28b). The globular N-terminal segment of type IX collagen extends from the type II fibril at the end of one of its helical segments, as does a chondroitin sulfate GAG chain (chondroitin sulfate is described below) that is sometimes linked to one of the type IX chains. These protruding nonhelical structures are thought to anchor the type II fibril to proteoglycans and other components of the matrix. The interrupted triple-helical structure of type IX and related collagens prevents them from assembling into fibrils, although they can associate with fibrils formed from other collagen types and form covalent cross-links to them.

Mutations affecting type I collagen and its associated proteins cause a variety of human diseases. Certain mutations in the genes encoding the type I collagen $\alpha 1$ (I) or $\alpha 2$ (I) chains lead to osteogenesis imperfecta, or brittle-bone disease. Because every third position in a collagen $\alpha$ chain must be a glycine for the triple helix to form (see Figure 20-25), mutations of glycine to almost any other amino acid are deleterious, resulting in poorly formed and unstable helices. Only one defective $\alpha$ chain of the three in a collagen molecule can disrupt the whole molecule's triple-helical structure and function. A mutation in a single copy (allele) of either the $\alpha 1$ (I) gene or the $\alpha 2$ (I) gene, both located on autosomes, can cause this disorder. Thus it normally shows autosomal dominant inheritance (see Chapter 6).

Absence or malfunctioning of fibril-associated collagen in muscle tissue due to mutations in the type VI collagen genes cause dominant or recessive congenital muscular dystrophies with generalized muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, muscle wasting, and muscle-related joint abnormalities. Skin abnormalities have also been reported with type VI collagen disease.

## Proteoglycans and Their Constituent GAGs Play Diverse Roles in the ECM

As we saw with perlecan in the basal lamina, proteoglycans play an important role in cell-ECM adhesion. Proteoglycans are a subset of secreted or cell-surface glycoproteins containing covalently linked, specialized polysaccharide chains called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). GAGs are long linear polymers of specific repeating disaccharides. Usually one sugar is either a uronic acid (D-glucuronic acid or L-iduronic

acid) or D-galactose; the other sugar is N -acetylglucosamine or N -acetylgalactosamine (Figure 20-29). One or both of the sugars contain at least one anionic group (carboxylate or sulfate). Thus each GAG chain bears many negative charges. GAGs are classified into several major types based on the nature of the repeating disaccharide unit: heparan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, keratan sulfate, and hyaluronan (Figure 20-29). A hypersulfated form of heparan sulfate called heparin, produced mostly by mast cells, plays a key role in allergic reactions. It is also used medically as an anticlotting drug because of its ability to activate a natural clotting inhibitor called antithrombin III.

With the exception of hyaluronan, which is discussed below, all the major GAGs occur naturally as components of proteoglycans. Like other secreted and transmembrane glycoproteins, proteoglycan core proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, and the GAG chains are assembled on and covalently attached to these cores in the Golgi complex. To generate heparan or chondroitin sulfate chains, a three-sugar "linker" is first attached to the hydroxyl side chains of certain serine residues in a core protein; thus these GAGs are O-linked oligosaccharides (Figure 20-30). In contrast, the linkers for the addition of keratan sulfate chains are oligosaccharide chains attached to asparagine residues; such N -linked oligosaccharides are present in many glycoproteins (see Chapter 14), although only a subset carry GAG chains. All GAG chains are elongated by the alternating addition of sugar monomers to form the disaccharide repeats characteristic of a particular GAG; the chains are often modified subsequently by the covalent linkage of small molecules such as sulfate. The mechanisms responsible for determining which proteins are modified with GAGs, the sequence of disaccharides to be added, the sites to be sulfated, and the lengths of the GAG chains are unknown. The ratio of polysaccharide to protein in all proteoglycans is much higher than that in most other glycoproteins.

Function of GAG Chain Modifications Similar to the sequence of amino acids in proteins, the arrangement of the sugar residues in GAG chains and the modification of specific sugars in those chains can determine their function and that of the proteoglycans that contain them. For example, groupings of certain modified sugars in the GAG chains of heparin sulfate proteoglycans can control the binding of growth factors to certain receptors or the activities of proteins in the blood-clotting cascade.

In the past, the chemical and structural complexity of proteoglycans posed a daunting barrier to analyzing and understanding their structures and their many diverse functions. In recent years, investigators employing classic and state-of-the-art biochemical techniques, mass spectrometry, and genetics have begun to elucidate the detailed structures and functions of these ubiquitous ECM molecules. The results of ongoing studies suggest that sets of sugar-residue sequences containing common modifications, rather than single unique sequences, are responsible for specifying distinct GAG functions. A case in point is a set of five-residue

FIGURE 20-29 The repeating disaccharides of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Each of the four classes of GAGs is formed by polymerization of monomeric units into repeats of a particular disaccharide and subsequent modifications, including addition of sulfate groups and inversion (epimerization) of the carboxyl group on carbon 5 of D-glucuronic acid to yield L-iduronic acid. The squiggly lines represent covalent bonds that are oriented either above (D-glucuronic acid) or below (L-iduronic acid) the ring. Heparin is generated by hypersulfation of heparan sulfate, whereas hyaluronan is nonsulfated.

The basal laminal proteoglycan perlecan is primarily a heparan sulfate proteoglycan with three to four GAG chains, although it can sometimes have a bound chondroitin sulfate chain. Additional diversity in proteoglycans occurs because the numbers, compositions, and sequences of the GAG chains attached to otherwise identical core proteins can differ considerably. Laboratory generation and analysis of mutants with defects in proteoglycan production in Drosophila melanogaster, C. elegans, and mice have clearly shown that proteoglycans play critical roles in development; for example, as participants in various signaling pathways (see Chapter 16 for examples in the TGF- $\beta$ and Wnt pathways).

Syndecans are cell-surface proteoglycans expressed by epithelial and nonepithelial cells that bind to collagens and multi-adhesive matrix proteins such as fibronectin, anchoring cells to the ECM. Like that of many integral membrane proteins, the cytosolic domain of syndecan interacts with

Sets of modified five-residue sequences in the much longer GAG called heparin with the composition shown here bind to ATIII and activate it, thereby inhibiting blood clotting. The sulfate groups in red type are essential for this heparin function; the modifications in blue type may be present but are not essential. Other sets of modified GAG sequences are thought to regulate the activity of other target proteins.

the actin cytoskeleton and in some cases with intracellular regulatory molecules. In addition, cell-surface proteoglycans such as syndecan bind many protein growth factors and other external signaling molecules, thereby helping to regulate cellular metabolism and function. For instance, syndecans in the hypothalamic region of the brain modulate feeding behavior in response to food deprivation. They do so by participating in the binding to cell-surface receptors of antisatiety peptides that help control feeding behavior. In the fed state, the syndecan extracellular domain decorated with heparan sulfate GAG chains is released from the cell surface by proteolysis, thus suppressing the activity of the antisatiety peptides and feeding behavior. In mice engineered to overexpress the syndecan-1 gene in the hypothalamic region of the brain and other tissues, normal control of feeding by antisatiety peptides is disrupted, and the animals overeat and become obese.

## Hyaluronan Resists Compression, Facilitates Cell Migration, and Gives Cartilage Its Gel-Like Properties

Hyaluronan, also called hyaluronic acid (HA) or hyaluronate, is a nonsulfated GAG (see Figure 20-29a) made by a plasma-membrane-bound enzyme called HA synthase and is secreted directly into the extracellular space as it is synthesized. (A similar approach is used by plant cells to make the ECM component cellulose.) Hyaluronan is a major component of the ECM that surrounds migrating and proliferating cells, particularly in embryonic tissues. In addition, it forms the backbone of complex proteoglycan aggregates found in many ECMs, particularly cartilage. Because of its remarkable physical properties, hyaluronan imparts stiffness and resilience as well as a lubricating quality to many types of connective tissue such as joints.

Hyaluronan molecules range in length from a few disaccharide repeats to about 25,000 . The typical hyaluronan in joints such as the elbow has 10,000 repeats for a total mass of $4 \times 10^{6} \mathrm{Da}$ and a length of $10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ (about the diameter of a small cell). Individual segments of a hyaluronan molecule fold into a rodlike conformation because of the $\beta$ glycosidic linkages between the sugars and extensive intrachain hydrogen bonding. Mutual repulsion between negatively charged carboxylate groups that protrude outward at regular intervals also contributes to these locally rigid structures. Overall, however, hyaluronan is not a long, rigid rod like fibrillar collagen; rather, it is very flexible in solution, bending and twisting into many conformations, forming a random coil.

Because of the large number of anionic residues on its surface, the typical hyaluronan molecule binds a large amount of water and behaves as if it were a large hydrated sphere with a diameter of about 500 nm . As the concentration of hyaluronan increases, the long chains begin to entangle, forming a viscous gel. Even at low concentrations, hyaluronan forms a hydrated gel; when placed in a confining space, such as that between two cells, the long hyaluronan molecules tend to push outward. This outward pushing creates
a swelling, or turgor pressure, within the extracellular space. In addition, the binding of cations by carboxylate $\left(\mathrm{COO}^{-}\right)$ groups on the surface of hyaluronan increases the concentration of ions and thus the osmotic pressure in the gel. As a result, large amounts of water are taken up, contributing to the turgor pressure. These swelling forces give connective tissues their ability to resist compression forces, in contrast to collagen fibers, which are best able to resist stretching forces. Other highly charged GAG chains are similarly hydrated.

Hyaluronan is bound to the surface of many migrating cells by a number of adhesion receptors, such as the receptor called CD44, which contains hyaluronan-binding domains, each with a similar three-dimensional conformation. Because of its loose, hydrated, porous nature, the hyaluronan "coat" bound to cells appears to keep them apart from one another, giving them the freedom to move about and proliferate. The cessation of cell movement and the initiation of cell-cell attachments are frequently correlated with a decrease in hyaluronan, a decrease in hyaluronan receptors, and an increase in the extracellular enzyme hyaluronidase, which degrades hyaluronan in the matrix. These alterations of hyaluronan are particularly important during the many cell migrations that facilitate differentiation and in the release of a mammalian egg cell from its surrounding cells after ovulation.

The predominant proteoglycan in cartilage, called aggrecan, assembles with hyaluronan into very large aggregates, illustrative of the complex structures that proteoglycans sometimes form. The backbone of this proteoglycan aggregate is a long molecule of hyaluronan to which multiple aggrecan molecules are bound tightly but noncovalently (Figure 20-32). A single hyaluronan-aggrecan aggregate, one of the largest macromolecular complexes known, can be more than $4 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ long and have a volume larger than that of a bacterial cell. These aggregates give cartilage its unique gel-like properties and its resistance to deformation, essential for distributing the load in weight-bearing joints.

The aggrecan core protein ( $\sim 250,000 \mathrm{MW}$ ) has one N -terminal globular domain that binds with high affinity to a specific decasaccharide sequence within hyaluronan. This specific sequence is generated by covalent modification of some of the repeating disaccharides in the hyaluronan chain. The interaction between aggrecan and hyaluronan is facilitated by a link protein that binds to both the aggrecan core protein and hyaluronan (Figure 20-32b). Aggrecan and the link protein have in common a "link" domain, about 100 amino acids long, that is found in numerous ECM and cell-surface hyaluronan-binding proteins in both cartilaginous and noncartilaginous tissues. These proteins almost certainly arose in the course of evolution from a single ancestral gene that encoded just this domain.

## Fibronectins Connect Cells and ECM, Influencing Cell Shape, Differentiation, and Movement

Many different cell types synthesize fibronectin, an abundant multi-adhesive matrix protein found in all vertebrates. The discovery that fibronectin functions as an adhesion

FIGURE 20-32 Structure of proteoglycan aggregate from cartilage. (a) Electron micrograph of an aggrecan aggregate from fetal bovine epiphyseal cartilage. Aggrecan core proteins are bound at $\sim 40-\mathrm{nm}$ intervals to a molecule of hyaluronan. (b) Schematic representation of an aggrecan monomer bound to hyaluronan (yellow). In aggrecan, both keratan sulfate (green) and chondroitin sulfate (orange) chains are attached to the core protein. The N -terminal domain of the core protein binds noncovalently to a hyaluronan molecule. Binding is facilitated by a link protein, which binds to both the hyaluronan molecule and the aggrecan core protein. Each aggrecan core protein has 127 Ser-Gly sequences at which GAG chains can be added. The molecular weight of an aggrecan monomer averages $2 \times 10^{6}$. The entire aggregate, which may contain upward of 100 aggrecan monomers, has a molecular weight in excess of $2 \times 10^{8}$ and is about as large as the bacterium E. coli. [Part (a) from Buckwalter, J. A., et al., "Structural changes during development in bovine fetal epiphyseal cartilage," Collagen Rel. Res., 1983, 3(6):489-504, © Elsevier.]
molecule stemmed from observations that it is present on the surfaces of normal fibroblasts, which adhere tightly to petri dishes in laboratory experiments, but is absent from the surfaces of tumorigenic (i.e., cancerous) cells, which adhere weakly. The 20 or so isoforms of fibronectin are generated by alternative splicing of the RNA transcript produced from
a single gene (see Figure 5-16). Fibronectins are essential for the migration and differentiation of many cell types in embryogenesis. These proteins are also important for wound healing because they promote blood clotting and facilitate the migration of macrophages and other immune-system cells into the affected area.

Fibronectins help attach cells to the ECM by binding to other ECM components, particularly fibrillar collagens and heparan sulfate proteoglycans, and to adhesion receptors such as integrins (see Figure 20-2). Through their interactions with adhesion receptors, fibronectins influence the shape and movement of cells and the organization of the cytoskeleton. Conversely, by regulating their receptor-mediated attachments to fibronectin and other ECM components, cells can sculpt the immediate ECM environment to suit their needs.

Fibronectins are dimers of two similar polypeptides linked at their C-termini by two disulfide bonds; each chain is about $60-70 \mathrm{~nm}$ long and $2-3 \mathrm{~nm}$ thick. Partial digestion of fibronectin with small amounts of proteases and analysis of the fragments showed that each chain comprises several functional regions with different ligand-binding specificities (Figure 20-33a). Each region, in turn, contains multiple copies of certain domain-encoding sequences that can be classified into one of three types. These domains are designated fibronectin type I, II, and III repeats, on the basis of similarities in amino acid sequence, although the sequences of any two repeats of a given type are not identical. These linked repeats give the molecule the appearance of beads on a string. The combination of the different repeats composing the regions confers on fibronectin its ability to bind multiple ligands.

One of the type III repeats in the cell-binding region of fibronectin mediates binding to certain integrins. The results of studies with synthetic peptides corresponding to parts of this repeat identified the tripeptide sequence Arg-Gly-Asp, called the RGD motif, as the minimal sequence within this repeat required for recognition by those integrins. In one study, heptapeptides with and without the RGD motif were tested for their ability to mediate the adhesion of rat kidney cells to a culture dish. The results showed that heptapeptides containing the RGD motif mimicked intact fibronectin's ability to stimulate integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas variant heptapeptides lacking this sequence were ineffective (Figure 20-34).

A three-dimensional model of fibronectin binding to integrin, based on partial structures of both fibronectin and integrin, has been assembled. In a high-resolution structure of the integrin-binding fibronectin type III repeat and its neighboring type III domain, the RGD motif is at the apex of a loop that protrudes outward from the molecule, in a position facilitating binding to integrins (Figure 20-33b). Although the RGD motif is required for binding to several different integrins, its affinity for integrins is substantially less than that of intact fibronectin or of the entire cell-binding region in fibronectin. Thus structural features near the RGD motif in fibronectins (e.g., parts of adjacent repeats,

FIGURE 20-33 Organization of fibronectin and its binding to integrin. (a) Scale model of fibronectin is shown docked by two type III repeats to the extracellular domains of integrin. Only one of the two similar chains, which are linked by disulfide bonds near their C -termini, in the dimeric fibronectin molecule is shown. Each chain contains about 2446 amino acids and is composed of three types of repeating amino acid sequences (type I, II, or III repeats) or domains. The EIIIA, EIIIBboth type III repeats-and IIICS domain are variably spliced into the structure at locations indicated by arrows. Circulating fibronectin lacks EIIIA, EIIIB, or both. At least five different sequences may be present in the IIICS region as a result of alternative splicing (see Figure 5-16).
such as the synergy region; see Figure 20-33b) and in other RGD-containing proteins must enhance their binding to certain integrins. Moreover, the simple soluble dimeric forms of fibronectin produced by the liver or by fibroblasts are initially in a nonfunctional conformation that binds poorly to integrins because the RGD motif is not readily accessible. The adsorption of fibronectin onto a collagen matrix or basal lamina-or, experimentally, to a plastic tissue culture

Each chain contains several multi-repeat-containing regions, some of which contain specific binding sites for heparan sulfate, fibrin (a major constituent of blood clots), collagen, and cell-surface integrins. The integrin-binding domain is also known as the cell-binding domain. Structures of fibronectin's domains were determined from fragments of the molecule. (b) A high-resolution structure shows that the RGD motif (red) extends outward in a loop from its compact type III domain on the same side of fibronectin as the synergy region (blue), which also contributes to high-affinity binding to integrins.

dish—results in a conformational change that enhances the ability of fibronectin to bind to cells. Possibly, this conformational change increases the accessibility of the RGD motif for integrin binding.

Microscopy and other experimental approaches (e.g., biochemical binding experiments) have demonstrated the role of integrins in cross-linking fibronectin and other ECM components to the cytoskeleton. For example, the colocalization of cytoskeletal actin filaments and integrins within cells can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Figure 20-35a). The binding of cell-surface integrins to fibronectin in the

## EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 20-34 A specific tripeptide sequence (RGD) in the cell-binding region of fibronectin is required

for adhesion of cells. The cell-binding region of fibronectin contains an integrin-binding hexapeptide sequence, GRGDSP in the single-letter amino acid code. Together with an additional C-terminal cysteine (C) residue, this heptapeptide and several variants were synthesized chemically. Different concentrations of each synthetic peptide were added to polystyrene dishes that had the protein immunoglobulin G (IgG) firmly attached to their surfaces; the peptides were then chemically cross-linked to the IgG. Subsequently, cultured normal rat kidney cells were added to the dishes and incubated for 30 minutes to allow adhesion. After the unbound cells were washed away, the relative amounts of cells that had adhered firmly were determined by staining the bound cells with a dye and measuring the intensity of the staining with a spectrophotometer. The results shown here indicate that cell adhesion increased above the background level with increasing peptide concentration for those peptides containing the RGD motif, but not for the variants lacking this sequence (modification underlined).

ECM induces the actin cytoskeleton-dependent movement of some integrin molecules in the plane of the plasma membrane. The ensuing mechanical tension due to the relative movement of different integrins bound to a single fibronectin dimer stretches the fibronectin (see Figure 20-9), a mechanosensor, and promotes self-association of fibronectins into multimeric fibrils.

The force needed to unfold and expose functional selfassociation sites in fibronectin is much less than that needed to disrupt fibronectin-integrin binding. Thus fibronectin molecules remain bound to integrin while cell-generated mechanical forces induce fibril formation. In effect, the integrins, through adapter proteins, transmit the intracellular forces generated by the actin cytoskeleton to extracellular fibronectin (inside-out signaling via mechanotransduction). Gradually, the initially formed fibronectin fibrils mature into highly stable matrix components by covalent cross-linking. In some electron micrographs, exterior fibronectin fibrils appear to be aligned in a seemingly continuous line with bundles of actin fibers within the cell (Figure 20-35b). These observations and the results from other studies provided the first example of a molecularly well-defined adhesion receptor forming a bridge between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the ECM components-a phenomenon now known to be widespread.

## Elastic Fibers Permit Many Tissues to Undergo Repeated Stretching and Recoiling

Elastic fibers are found in the ECM of a wide variety of tissues that are subject to mechanical strain or deformation, such as the lungs, which expand and contract during breathing (Figure 20-36a); the blood vessels, through which

blood pulses due to the heartbeat, and the skin and many other tissues that stretch and contract. Elastic fibers permit the rubberlike reversible elastic stretching and recoiling of these tissues.

The major component of an elastic fiber, which can be several hundred to several thousand nanometers in diameter, is an insoluble, amorphous core composed of the protein elastin. Elastin consists of aggregates of monomeric tropoelastin molecules that are covalently cross-linked via a lysyl oxidase-mediated process similar to that seen in collagen. Repetitive proline- and glycine-enriched hydrophobic sequence motifs contribute to the ability of tropoelastins to self-associate, extend under stress, and recoil efficiently after stretching. The elastin core is surrounded by a collection of $10-12$-nm-diameter microfibrils made up of the proteins fibrillin, fibulin, and associated proteins such as LTBPs (Figure 20-36b). The microfibrils serve as scaffolds for the assembly of the elastic fiber's core. Elastin-free microfibrils are found in the eye, where they transmit muscular force to reshape the lens for focusing and may provide structural support to the cornea.

Similar to other components of the ECM, microfibrils participate in cell signaling. In the secretory pathway, LTBPs bind the inactive form of transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$; see Chapter 16) prior to their co-secretion and incorporation into microfibrils (indeed, LTBP is an acronym for latent TGF- $\beta$ binding protein). Biomechanical stress mediated by cell-surface integrins binding to and pulling on the LTBP/TGF- $\beta$ complex or proteolytic cleavage are thought to be the direct cause of active TGF- $\beta$ release from the ECM and subsequent signaling (see Figure 16-3).

$\square$A variety of diseases, many involving skeletal and cardiovascular abnormalities, are consequences of mutations in the genes encoding the structural proteins of elastic fibers or the proteins that contribute to their proper assembly. For example, mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene cause Marfan syndrome, whose varied symptoms can include bone overgrowth, loose joints, abnormally long extremities and face, and cardiovascular defects due to weakness in the walls of the aorta and other blood vessels. There has been considerable speculation that President Abraham Lincoln's unusually tall, elongated body may have been a consequence of Marfan syndrome.

In mammals, most tropoelastin synthesis occurs immediately before and after birth during the late fetal and neonatal periods. Thus most of the body's elastin must be very durable, lasting an entire lifetime. The extraordinary stability of elastin has been measured in a variety of ways. Pulse-chase experiments (see Chapter 3) using radioactive amino acid administration can be used to measure the life span of elastin in animals. In humans, two other methods employed to study the longevity of elastin have revealed that the mean lifetime of an elastin molecule in human lungs is about 70 years! The first method takes advantage of a naturally
occurring phenomenon: the slow, natural rate of conversion of L-aspartic acid-incorporated into proteins during their synthesis-to D-aspartic acid. Thus the age of a long-lived protein can be estimated using chemical analysis to determine the fraction of its l-aspartic acid that has been converted over time to the D isomer, together with knowledge of the age of the tissue from which it was isolated. The second method is a variation on the classic pulse-chase experiments used in the laboratory. As a consequence of nuclear weapons testing in the 1950 s and $1960 \mathrm{~s},{ }^{14} \mathrm{C}$ was introduced into the atmosphere and hence the food chain. This environmental ${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}$ has been used as the radioactive "pulse" in what is essentially a pulse-chase experiment to determine the stability of proteins of interest.

## Metalloproteases Remodel and Degrade the Extracellular Matrix

Many key physiological processes, including morphogenesis during development, control of cellular proliferation and motility, response to injury, and even survival, require not only the production of ECM, but also its remodeling or degradation. Because of its enormous importance as a key element in the extracellular environment of multicellular organisms, remodeling and degradation of the ECM must be carefully controlled. Degradation of the ECM is often mediated by zinc-dependent ECM metalloproteases. Given the wide array of ECM components, it is not surprising that there are many such metalloproteases with varying substrate specificities and sites of expression. In many cases, their names incorporate the names of their substrates, as for the metalloproteases called collagenases, gelatinases, elastases, and aggrecanases. Some are secreted into the extracellular fluid, and others are closely associated with the plasma membranes of cells, either tightly bound in a noncovalent association with the membrane or as integral membrane proteins. Many are initially synthesized as inactive precursors that must be specifically activated to function.

ECM metalloproteases are divided into three major subgroups based on the enzymes' structures: matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) (of which there are 23 in humans), $a$ disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs), and ADAMs with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTSs). These proteases can degrade ECM components as well as non-ECM components such as adhesion receptors. Indeed, a key function of ADAMs is cleaving extracellular domains from integral membrane proteins. One mechanism used to control the activities of these proteases is the production of protein inhibitors called TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) and RECK (reversion-inducing-cysteine-rich protein with kazal motifs). Some of these inhibitors have their own cell-surface receptors and functions independent of their ability to inhibit metalloproteinases. ECM-degrading proteases are associated with a variety of diseases, the best known of which is metastatic (spreading) cancer (see Chapter 24).

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 20.4

## The Extracellular Matrix II: Connective Tissue

- Connective tissue, such as tendon and cartilage, differs from other solid tissues in that most of its volume is made up of extracellular matrix (ECM) rather than cells.
- The synthesis of fibrillar collagen (e.g., types I, II, and III) begins inside the cell with the chemical modification of newly made $\alpha$ chains and their assembly into triple-helical procollagen within the endoplasmic reticulum. After secretion, procollagen molecules are cleaved, associate laterally, and are covalently cross-linked into bundles called fibrils, which can form larger assemblies called fibers (see Figure 20-27).
- The various collagens are distinguished by the ability of their helical and nonhelical regions to associate into fibrils, to form sheets, or to cross-link other collagen types (see Table 20-5).
- Proteoglycans consist of membrane-associated or secreted core proteins covalently linked to one or more glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains, which are linear polymers of disaccharides that are often modified by sulfation.
- Cell-surface proteoglycans such as the syndecans facilitate cell-ECM interactions and help present certain external signaling molecules to their cell-surface receptors.
- Hyaluronan, a highly hydrated GAG, is a major component of the ECM of migrating and proliferating cells. Certain adhesion receptors bind hyaluronan to cells.
- Large proteoglycan aggregates containing a central hyaluronan molecule noncovalently bound to the core proteins of proteoglycan molecules (e.g., aggrecan) contribute to the ability of the matrix to resist compression forces (see Figure 20-32).
- Fibronectins are abundant multi-adhesive matrix proteins that play a key role in migration and cellular differentiation. They contain binding sites for integrins and ECM components (collagens, proteoglycans) and thus can attach cells to the ECM (see Figure 20-33).
- The tripeptide RGD motif Arg-Gly-Asp, found in fibronectins and some other matrix proteins, is recognized by several integrins.
- Elastic fibers permit repeated stretching and recoiling of tissues because of their highly elastic core of cross-linked, amorphous elastin, which is surrounded by a network of microfibrils that help assemble the fibers and regulate signaling mediated by TGF- $\beta$.
- The remodeling or degradation of ECM is mediated by a large number of secreted and cell-membrane-associated zinc metalloproteases that fall into several families (MMPs, ADAMs, ADAMTSs) and whose activities are regulated by protein inhibitors (TIMPs and RECK).


### 20.5 Adhesive Interactions in Motile and Nonmotile Cells

After adhesive interactions in epithelia form during differentiation, they are often very stable and can last throughout the life span of the cells or until the epithelium undergoes further differentiation. Although such long-lasting (nonmotile, also called sessile) adhesion also exists in nonepithelial tissues, some nonepithelial cells must be able to crawl across or through a layer of ECM or other cells. Moreover, during development or wound healing and in certain pathological states (e.g., cancer), epithelial cells can transform into more motile cells (the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition). Changes in expression of adhesion molecules play a key role in this transformation, as they do in other biological processes involving cell movement, such as the crawling of white blood cells into tissue sites of infection. In this section, we describe various cell-surface structures that mediate transient adhesive interactions that are especially adapted for the movement of cells as well as those that mediate long-lasting adhesion. The intracellular mechanisms used to generate the mechanical forces that propel cells and modify their shapes are covered in Chapters 17 and 18.

## Integrins Mediate Adhesion and Relay Signals Between Cells and Their Three-Dimensional Environment

As already discussed, integrins connect epithelial cells to the basal lamina and, through adapter proteins, to intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton (see Figure 20-1). That is, integrins form a bridge between the ECM and the cytoskeleton; they do the same in nonepithelial cells. In epithelial and nonepithelial cells, integrins in the plasma membrane are also clustered with other molecules in various focal contacts (focal adhesions) and focal contact-like adhesive structures called focal complexes, 3-D adhesions, and fibrillar adhesions, as well as in circular adhesions called podosomes. These structures are multiprotein complexes that mediate (1) cell adhesion to the ECM-for example, via integrin binding to fibronectin (see Figure 20-35) or laminin, (2) integrin association with the actin cytoskeleton, (3) adhesion-dependent outside-in and inside-out signaling (see Figure 20-8), and (4) mechanosensory coupling between cells and their environments. These complexes are readily observed by fluorescence microscopy with the use of antibodies that recognize integrins or other molecules clustered with them (Figure 20-37).

Integrin-containing adhesive structures are dynamic due to ongoing import, export, or covalent modification of their components, and each contains dozens of intracellular adapter and associated proteins. The hundreds of such proteins identified to date have the potential to engage in many hundreds of distinct protein-protein interactions that may be subject to regulation. For example, binding sites generated by phosphorylation of integrin and its associated proteins, as well as by generation of phosphorylated derivatives of

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 20-37 Integrins cluster into adhesive structures with various morphologies in nonepithelial cells. Immunofluorescence methods were used to detect integrincontaining adhesive structures (green) on cultured cells. Shown here are (a) focal adhesions and (b) 3-D adhesions on the surfaces of human fibroblasts. Cells were grown (a) directly on the flat surface of a culture dish or (b) on a three-dimensional matrix of ECM components.

phosphatidylinositol in the adjacent membrane, recruit additional proteins into, and can also cause release of some proteins from, these multiprotein complexes. A tightly controlled choreography of internal signals, contributions of other signaling pathways such as those involving receptor tyrosine kinases (see Figure 20-8), and external signals (such as the composition and rigidity of the ECM) regulates these complexes. Together, they help define the precise composition and activity of the integrin multiprotein complex and the consequent influence that it has on cellular structure and activity (outside-in effect) as well as the influence of the cellular actin cytoskeleton on the ECM (inside-out effect).

Although found in many nonepithelial cells, integrincontaining adhesive structures have been studied most frequently in fibroblasts grown in cell culture on flat glass or plastic surfaces called substrata. These conditions only poorly approximate the three-dimensional ECM environment that normally surrounds such cells in vivo. When fibroblasts are cultured in three-dimensional ECMs derived from cells or tissues, they form adhesions to the three-dimensional ECM substratum, called 3-D adhesions. These structures differ somewhat in composition, shape, distribution, and activity from the focal or fibrillar adhesions seen in cells growing on the flat substrata typically used in cell culture experiments (see Figure 20-37). Cultured fibroblasts with these "more natural" anchoring junctions display greater adhesion and mobility, increased rates of cell proliferation, and spindle-shaped morphologies more like those of fibroblasts in tissues than do cells cultured on hard, flat surfaces. These and other observations indicate that the topological, compositional, and mechanical properties of the ECM all play a role in controlling the shape and activity of a cell. Tissue-specific differences in these ECM characteristics probably contribute to the tissue-specific properties of cells.

The importance of the three-dimensional environment of cells has been highlighted by cell culture studies of the morphogenesis, functioning, and stability of
specialized milk-producing mammary epithelial cells and their cancerous transformed counterparts. For example, the three-dimensional ECM-dependent outside-in signaling mediated by integrins influences the epidermal growth fac-tor-tyrosine kinase receptor signaling system, and vice versa. The three-dimensional ECM also permits the mammary epithelial cells to generate in vivo-like circular epithelial structures, called acini, which secrete the major protein constituents of milk. The use of such three-dimensional ECM cell culture systems permits more realistic comparisons of the responses of normal and cancer cells to potential chemotherapeutic agents. Analogous systems employing both natural and synthetic three-dimensional ECMs are being developed to provide more in vivo-like conditions to study other complex tissues and organs, such as the liver.

## Regulation of Integrin-Mediated Adhesion and Signaling Controls Cell Movement

Cells can exquisitely control the strength of integrin-mediated cell-matrix interactions by regulating integrin's expression levels, ligand-binding activities, or both. Such regulation is critical to the role of these interactions in cell migration and other functions involving cell movement.

Integrin Binding Many, if not all, integrins can exist in at least two conformations: a low-affinity (inactive) form and a high-affinity (active) form (Figure 20-38a). The results of structural studies and experiments investigating the binding of ligands by integrins have provided a model of the changes that take place when integrins are activated. In the inactive state, the $\alpha \beta$ heterodimer is bent (Figure 20-38a, top, and 20-38c), the conformation of the ligand-binding site at the tip of the extracellular domain allows only low-affinity ligand binding, and the transmembrane domains and cytoplasmic C-terminal tails of the two subunits are closely bound together. In the active state, subtle structural alterations in the conformation of the binding site permit tighter

![li5035345559](li5035345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 20-38 Model for integrin activation. (a) Activation of integrins is thought to be due to conformational changes that include key movements near the propeller and $\beta A$ domains, which increase the molecule's affinity for its ligands. These conformational changes are accompanied by straightening of the molecule from the inactive, low-affinity, "bent" conformation (top) to the active, high-affinity, "extended" conformation (bottom). Activation also involves separation (indicated by double-headed arrow, bottom) of the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, induced by or resulting in altered interactions with the adapter proteins talin and kindlin, whose sites of binding to the cytoplasmic tail of the $\beta$ chain are indicated by green and yellow ovals, respectively. (b) Single inactive (bent) integrin $\alpha \mathrm{lb} \beta 3$ molecules (top panel) were incorporated into phospholipid nanodiscs (small bilayers in which the extracellular and cytoplasmic domains of the integrin are exposed to a buffer), and the integrin-binding and activating "head" domain of the adapter protein
(high-affinity) ligand binding and are accompanied by separation of the heterodimer's transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (Figure 20-38a, bottom). Activation is also accompanied by the straightening of the molecule into a more extended, linear form in which the ligand-binding site is projected farther away from the surface of the membrane.

These structural models provide an attractive explanation for the ability of integrins to mediate outside-in and inside-out signaling. The binding of certain ECM molecules or CAMs on other cells to the integrin's extracellular ligandbinding site would hold the integrin in the active form with separated cytoplasmic tails. Intracellular adapter proteins could "sense" the separation of the tails and, as a result, either bind to or dissociate from the tails. The changes in these adapters could then alter the cytoskeleton and activate or inhibit intracellular signaling pathways. Conversely, changes in the metabolic or signaling state of the cells could cause intracellular adapters to bind to or dissociate from
talin was added to some of these preparations (bottom panel). Multiple electron microscopic images of individual nanodiscs were collected and averaged. Phospholipid nanodiscs are indicated by dashed white circles, and the heights of the integrin extracellular regions that extend above the nanodiscs are indicated by brackets. (c) This molecular model of the extracellular region of $\alpha v \beta 3$ integrin in its inactive, lowaffinity ("bent") form, with the $\alpha$ subunit in shades of blue and the $\beta$ subunit in shades of red, is based on $x$-ray crystallography. The major ligand-binding sites are at the tip of the molecule, where the propeller domain of the $\alpha$ subunit (dark blue) and $\beta A$ domain (dark red) interact. An RGD peptide ligand is shown in yellow. See M. Arnaout et al., 2002, Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 14:641; R. O. Hynes, 2002, Cell 110:673; F. Ye et al., 2010, J. Cell Biol. 188:157-173; and M.

the cytoplasmic tails of the integrins and thus force the tails either to separate or to associate (see Figure 20-38a). As a consequence, the integrin would be either bent (inactivated) or straightened (activated), thereby altering its interaction with the ECM or with other cells. Indeed, in vitro studies of purified integrins reconstituted individually into lipid bilayer "nanodiscs" show that binding of the globular "head" domain of the adapter/mechanosensor protein talin (see Figure 20-9b) to the cytoplasmic tail of integrin's $\beta$ chain is sufficient to activate integrin, inducing a straightening of the bent conformation into an extended, active form (see Figure 20-38a, bottom; and 20-38b, bottom). Other studies suggest that the efficient activation of integrins in intact cells may also require the participation of another class of adapter proteins called kindlins, which bind to a distinct site on the cytoplasmic tail of integrin's $\beta$ chain (see Figure 20-38a, bottom). Kindlin plays a key role in the integrin- and microfibril-mediated activation of TGF- $\beta$ (inside-out

signaling involving elastic fibers and their microfibril-associated protein LTBP, described earlier) and other pathways of integrin-mediated signaling.

Platelet function, discussed in more detail below, provides a good example of how cell-matrix interactions are modulated by control of integrin binding activity. Platelets are cell fragments that circulate in the blood and clump together with ECM molecules to form a blood clot. In its basal state, the $\alpha \mathrm{IIb} \beta 3$ integrin present on the plasma membranes of platelets cannot bind tightly to its protein ligands (including fibrinogen and fibronectin), all of which participate in the formation of a blood clot, because it is in the inactive (bent) conformation. During clot formation, platelets are activated by binding to ECM proteins such as collagen and a large protein called von Willabrand factor that, through binding to receptors, generate intracellular signals. Platelets may also be activated by ADP or the clotting enzyme thrombin. These signals induce changes in signaling pathways within the platelet that result in an activating conformational change in the platelet's $\alpha \mathrm{IIb} \beta 3$ integrin. As a consequence, this integrin can bind tightly to extracellular clotting proteins and participate in clot formation. People with genetic defects in the $\beta 3$ integrin subunit are prone to excessive bleeding, attesting to the role of the $\alpha \mathrm{IIb} \beta 3$ integrin in the formation of blood clots (see Table 20-4).

Integrin Expression The attachment of cells to ECM components can also be modulated by altering the number of integrin molecules exposed on the cell surface. The $\alpha 4 \beta 1$ integrin, which is found on many hematopoietic cells, offers an example of this regulatory mechanism. For these hematopoietic cells to proliferate and differentiate, they must be attached to fibronectin synthesized by supportive (stromal) cells in the bone marrow. The $\alpha 4 \beta 1$ integrin on hematopoietic cells binds to a Glu-Ile-Leu-Asp-Val (EILDV) sequence in fibronectin in the ECM, thereby anchoring the cells to the matrix. This integrin also binds to a sequence in a CAM called vascular CAM-1 (VCAM-1), which is present on stromal cells of the bone marrow. Thus hematopoietic cells directly contact the stromal cells as well as the ECM. Late in their differentiation, hematopoietic cells decrease their expression of this integrin; the resulting reduction in the number of $\alpha 4 \beta 1$ integrin molecules on the cell surface is thought to allow mature blood cells to detach from the ECM and stromal cells in the bone marrow and enter the circulation.

## Connections Between the ECM and Cytoskeleton Are Defective in Muscular Dystrophy

$\square$The importance of the adhesion receptor-mediated linkage between ECM components and the cytoskeleton is highlighted by a set of hereditary muscle-wasting diseases, collectively called muscular dystrophies. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), the most common type, is a sex-linked disorder, affecting 1 in 3300 boys, that
results in cardiac or respiratory failure, usually in the late teens or early twenties. The first clue to understanding the molecular basis of this disease came from the discovery that people with DMD carry mutations in the gene encoding a protein named dystrophin. This very large protein was found to be a cytosolic adapter protein that binds to actin filaments and to an adhesion receptor called dystroglycan (Figure 20-39).

Dystroglycan is synthesized as a large glycoprotein precursor that is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits soon after it is synthesized and before it moves to the cell surface. The $\alpha$ subunit is an extracellular peripheral membrane protein, and the $\beta$ subunit is a transmembrane protein whose extracellular domain associates with the $\alpha$ subunit (see Figure 20-39). Multiple O-linked oligosaccharides are attached covalently to the side-chain hydroxyl groups of serine and threonine residues in the $\alpha$ subunit. Some of these linkages are unlike those in the most abundant O-linked oligosaccharides (also called mucin-like oligosaccharides),
![li5135345559](li5135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 20-39 The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) in skeletal muscle cells. This schematic model shows that the DGC comprises three subcomplexes: the $\alpha, \beta$ dystroglycan subcomplex; the sarcoglycan/sarcospan subcomplex of integral membrane proteins; and the cytosolic adapter subcomplex comprising dystrophin, other adapter proteins, and signaling molecules. Through its $O$-linked matriglycan sugars (see Figure 20-30c), $\alpha$-dystroglycan binds to components of the basal lamina, such as laminin and perlecan, and to cell-surface proteins, such as neurexin in neurons. Dystrophin-the protein that is defective in Duchenne muscular dystrophy-links $\beta$-dystroglycan to the actin cytoskeleton, and $\alpha$-dystrobrevin links dystrophin to the sarcoglycan/sarcospan subcomplex. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS) produces nitric oxide, a gaseous signaling molecule, and GRB2 is a component of signaling pathways activated by certain cell-surface receptors (see Chapter 15). See S. J. Winder, 2001, Trends Biochem. Sci. 26:118; D. E. Michele and K. P. Campbell, 2003, J. Biol. Chem. 278(18):15457-15460; and T. YoshidaMoriguchi and K. P. Campbell, 2015, Glycobiology 25:702-713.

in which an N -acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) is the first sugar in the chain linked directly to the hydroxyl group of the side chain of serine or threonine (see Figure 20-30b), or the linkage in proteoglycans (see Figure 20-30a). Instead, some of the more than 20 O -linked chains in dystroglycan are directly linked to the hydroxyl group via a mannose sugar (see Figure 20-30c). One of these O-mannose-linked chains has a phosphate group attached to the mannose. The phosphate is then attached via an unknown link to a GAG-like polymer of xylose-glucuronic acid disaccharides called matriglycan. Matriglycan addition to dystroglycan in the Golgi complex, which is catalyzed by an enzyme called LARGE, requires the prior addition of the phosphorylated O-mannose-linked trisaccharide shown in Figure 20-30c.

The $O$-linked matriglycan binds to various components of the basal lamina, including the LG domains of the multi-adhesive matrix protein laminin (see Figure 20-24) and the proteoglycans perlecan and agrin. The neurexins, a family of adhesion molecules expressed by neurons, are also bound via O-mannose-linked sugars.

The transmembrane segment of the dystroglycan $\beta$ subunit associates with a complex of integral membrane proteins; its cytosolic domain binds dystrophin and other adapter proteins as well as various intracellular signaling proteins (see Figure 20-39). The resulting large, heteromeric assemblage, the dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC), links the ECM to the actin cytoskeleton and to signaling pathways within muscle and other types of cells. For instance, the signaling enzyme nitric oxide synthase (NOS) is associated through syntrophin with the DGC in skeletal muscle. The rise in intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ during muscle contraction activates NOS to produce nitric oxide (NO), a signaling molecule that diffuses into smooth muscle cells surrounding nearby blood vessels. NO promotes smooth muscle relaxation, leading to a local rise in the flow of blood supplying nutrients and oxygen to the skeletal muscle. Heart (cardiac) muscle contraction may be influenced by similar NOS-syntrophin interactions.

Mutations in dystrophin, other DGC components, laminin, or the multiple enzymes that effect the addition of matriglycan to dystroglycan can all disrupt the DGC-mediated link between the exterior and the interior of muscle cells and cause muscular dystrophies. In addition, dystroglycan mutations have been shown to greatly reduce the clustering of acetylcholine receptors on muscle cells at the neuromuscular junctions, which is also dependent on the basal lamina proteins laminin and agrin. These and possibly other effects of DGC defects apparently lead to a cumulative loss of the mechanical stability of muscle cells as they undergo contraction and relaxation, resulting in deterioration of the cells and muscular dystrophy.

Dystroglycan provides an elegant—and medically rele-vant—example of the intricate networks of connectivity in cell biology. Dystroglycan was originally discovered in the context of studying muscular dystrophy. However, it was later shown to be expressed in nonmuscle cells and, through
its binding to laminin, to play a key role in the assembly and stability of at least some basement membranes. Thus it is essential for normal development. Additional studies led to its identification as a cell-surface receptor for the virus that causes the frequently fatal human disease Lassa fever and other related viruses, all of which bind via matriglycan, the oligosaccharide on dystroglycan that mediates its binding to laminin. Furthermore, dystroglycan is the receptor on specialized cells in the nervous system-Schwann cells-to which binds the pathogenic bacterium Mycobacterium leprae, the organism that causes leprosy.

## IgCAMs Mediate Cell-Cell Adhesion in Neural and Other Tissues

Numerous transmembrane proteins characterized by the presence of multiple immunoglobulin domains in their extracellular regions constitute the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of CAMs, or IgCAMs (for example, see NCAM in Figure 20-2). The Ig domain is a common protein domain, containing $70-110$ residues, that was first identified in antibodies, the antigen-binding immunoglobulins (see Chapter 23), but has a much older evolutionary origin in CAMs. The human, D. melanogaster, and C. elegans genomes include about 765,150 , and 64 genes, respectively, that encode proteins containing Ig domains. Immunoglobulin domains are found in a wide variety of cell-surface proteins, including the T-cell receptors produced by lymphocytes and many proteins that take part in adhesive interactions. Among the IgCAMs are neural CAMs; intercellular CAMs (ICAMs), which function in the movement of leukocytes into tissues; and junction adhesion molecules (JAMs), which are present in tight junctions (see Figure 20-18b).

As their name implies, neural CAMs are of particular importance in neural tissues. One type, the NCAMs, primarily mediate homophilic interactions. First expressed during morphogenesis, NCAMs play an important role in the differentiation of muscle cells, glial cells, and neurons. Their role in cell adhesion has been directly demonstrated by the inhibition of adhesion with anti-NCAM antibodies. Numerous NCAM isoforms, encoded by a single gene, are generated by alternative mRNA splicing and by differences in glycosylation. Other neural CAMs (e.g., L1-CAM) are encoded by different genes. In humans, mutations in different parts of the L1-CAM gene cause various neuropathologies (e.g., mental retardation, congenital hydrocephalus, and spasticity).

An NCAM comprises an extracellular region with five Ig domains and two fibronectin type III domains, a single membrane-spanning segment, and a cytosolic segment that interacts with the cytoskeleton (see Figure 20-2). In contrast, the extracellular region of L1-CAM has six Ig domains and four fibronectin type III domains. As with cadherins, cis (intracellular) interactions and trans (intercellular) interactions probably play key roles in IgCAM-mediated adhesion (see Figure 20-3); however, adhesion mediated by IgCAMs is $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ independent.

## Leukocyte Movement into Tissues Is Orchestrated by a Precisely Timed Sequence of Adhesive Interactions

In adult organisms, several types of white blood cells (leukocytes) participate in defense against infection caused by bacteria and viruses and respond to tissue damage due to trauma or inflammation. To fight infection and clear away damaged tissue, these cells must move rapidly from the blood, where they circulate as unattached, relatively quiescent cells, into the underlying tissue at sites of infection, inflammation, or damage. We know a great deal about the movement into tissue, termed extravasation, of four types of leukocytes: neutrophils, which release several antibacterial proteins; monocytes, the precursors of macrophages, which can engulf and destroy foreign particles; and T and B lymphocytes, the antigen-recognizing cells of the immune system (see Chapter 23).

Extravasation requires the successive formation and breakage of cell-cell contacts between leukocytes in the blood and endothelial cells lining the vessels. Some of these contacts are mediated by selectins, a family of CAMs that mediate leukocyte-vascular endothelium interactions. Endothelial cells express $P$ - and $E$-selectins on their blood-facing surfaces, activated platelets express P-selectin, and leukocytes express L-selectin. All selectins contain a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependent lectin domain, which is located at the distal end of the extracellular region of the molecule and recognizes particular
sugars in glycoproteins or glycolipids (see Figure 20-2). For example, the primary ligand for P - and E-selectins is an oligosaccharide called the sialyl Lewis-x antigen, a part of longer oligosaccharides present in abundance on leukocyte glycoproteins and glycolipids.

Figure 20-40 illustrates the basic sequence of cell-cell interactions leading to the extravasation of leukocytes. Various inflammatory signals released in areas of infection or inflammation first cause activation of the vascular endothelium. P-selectin exposed on the surfaces of activated endothelial cells mediates the weak adhesion of passing leukocytes. Because of the force of the blood flow and the rapid "on" and "off" rates of P-selectin binding to its ligands, these "trapped" leukocytes are slowed, but not stopped, and literally roll along the surface of the endothelium. Among the signals that promote activation of the endothelium are chemokines, a group of small secreted proteins ( $8-12 \mathrm{kDa}$ ) produced by a wide variety of cells, including endothelial cells and leukocytes.

For tight adhesion to occur between activated endothelial cells and leukocytes, $\beta 2$-containing integrins on the surfaces of the leukocytes must be activated indirectly by chemokines or by other local activation signals such as platelet-activating factor (PAF). Platelet-activating factor is unusual in that it is a phospholipid rather than a protein; it is exposed on the surfaces of activated endothelial cells at the same time that P-selectin is exposed. The binding of PAF or other activators to their G protein-coupled receptors on leukocytes

FIGURE 20-40 Endothelium-leukocyte interactions: activation, binding, rolling, and extravasation. Step $\mathbf{\square}$ In the absence of inflammation or infection, leukocytes and endothelial cells lining blood vessels are in a resting state and not interacting. Step $\mathbf{\square}$ Inflammatory signals released only in areas of inflammation, infection, or both activate resting endothelial cells, resulting in the movement of vesicle-sequestered selectins to the cell surface. The exposed selectins mediate weak binding of leukocytes by interacting with carbohydrate ligands on leukocytes. Blood flow forces the loosely bound leukocytes to roll along the endothelial surface of the blood vessel (curved arrow).

Activation of the endothelium also causes synthesis of plateletactivating factor (PAF) and ICAM-1, both expressed on the endothelial cell surface. PAF and other, usually secreted, activators, including chemokines, then induce changes in the shapes of the leukocytes and activation of leukocyte integrins such as $\alpha L \beta 2$, which is expressed by T lymphocytes (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The subsequent tight binding between activated integrins on leukocytes and CAMs on the endothelium (e.g., ICAM-2 and ICAM-1) results in firm adhesion (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ) and subsequent movement (extravasation) into the underlying tissue (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). See R. O. Hynes and A. Lander, 1992, Cell 68:303.

leads to activation of the leukocyte integrins (see Figure 2038). These activated integrins then bind to distinct IgCAMs on the surfaces of endothelial cells. These IgCAMs include ICAM-2, which is expressed constitutively, and ICAM-1, whose synthesis is induced by activation. ICAM-1 does not usually contribute substantially to leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells immediately after activation, but rather participates at later times in cases of chronic inflammation. The tight adhesion mediated by these $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent integrinICAM interactions leads to the cessation of rolling and to the spreading of leukocytes on the surface of the endothelium; soon the adhered cells move between adjacent endothelial cells and into the underlying tissue. The extravasation step itself (also called transmigration or diapedesis; step 5 in Figure 20-40) requires the dissociation of otherwise stable adhesive interactions between endothelial cells that are primarily mediated by the CAM VE-cadherin. There is general agreement that the leukocyte interactions with endothelial cells mediated by CAMs initiate outside-in signaling in the endothelial cells that involves phosphorylation, activation of small GTPases, and an increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. These signals weaken or disrupt VE-cadherin-mediated inter-endothelial-cell adherens junctions and increase actinmyosin contraction, which pulls the endothelial cells apart, thus permitting the paracellular, amoeboid movement of the leukocyte between adjacent endothelial cells that is responsible for most extravasation.

The selective adhesion of leukocytes to the endothelium near sites of infection or inflammation thus depends on the sequential appearance and activation of several different CAMs on the surfaces of the interacting cells. Different types of leukocytes express different integrins, though all contain the $\beta 2$ subunit. Nonetheless, all leukocytes move into tissues by the general mechanism depicted in Figure 20-40.

Many of the CAMs used to direct leukocyte adhesion are shared among different types of leukocytes and target tissues. Yet often only a particular type of leukocyte is directed to a particular tissue. How is this specificity achieved? A three-step model has been proposed to account for the celltype specificity of such leukocyte-endothelium interactions. First, endothelial activation promotes initial relatively weak, transient, and reversible binding (e.g., the interaction of selectins and their carbohydrate ligands). Without additional local activation signals, the leukocyte will quickly move on. Second, cells in the immediate vicinity of the site of infection or inflammation release or express chemical signals such as chemokines and PAFs that activate only special subsets of the transiently attached leukocytes, depending on the types of chemokine receptors those leukocytes express. Third, additional activation-dependent CAMs (e.g., integrins) engage their binding partners, leading to strong sustained adhesion. Only if the proper combination of CAMs, binding partners, and activation signals are engaged together with the appropriate timing at a specific site will a given leukocyte adhere strongly. Such combinatorial diversity and cross talk allows a small set of CAMs to serve diverse functions throughout the body-a good example of biological parsimony.

$\square$Leukocyte-adhesion deficiency is caused by a genetic defect in the synthesis of the integrin $\beta 2$ subunit. People with this disorder are susceptible to repeated bacterial infections because their leukocytes cannot extravasate properly and thus cannot effectively fight infection within a tissue.

Some pathogenic viruses have evolved mechanisms to exploit cell-surface proteins that participate in the normal response to inflammation. For example, many of the RNA viruses that cause the common cold (rhinoviruses) bind to and enter cells through ICAM-1, and chemokine receptors can be important entry sites for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of AIDS. Integrins appear to participate in the binding and/or internalization of a wide variety of viruses, including reoviruses (which cause fever and gastroenteritis, especially in infants), adenoviruses (which cause conjunctivitis and acute respiratory disease), and foot-and-mouth disease virus (which causes fever in cattle and pigs).

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 20.5

## Adhesive Interactions in Motile and Nonmotile Cells

- Many cells have integrin-containing clusters of proteins (e.g., focal adhesions, 3-D adhesions, podosomes) that physically and functionally connect cells to the ECM and facilitate inside-out and outside-in signaling.
- Via interaction with integrins, the three-dimensional structure of the ECM surrounding a cell can profoundly influence the behavior of the cell.
- Integrins exist in at least two conformations (bent/inactive, straight/active) that differ in their affinity for ligands and in their interactions with cytosolic adapter proteins (see Figure 20-38); switching between these two conformations allows regulation of integrin activity, which is important for control of cell adhesion and movements.
- Dystroglycan, an adhesion receptor, forms a large complex with dystrophin, other adapter proteins, and signaling molecules (see Figure 20-39). This complex links the actin cytoskeleton to the surrounding ECM, providing mechanical stability to muscle. Mutations in various components of this complex cause different types of muscular dystrophy.
- Neural cell-adhesion molecules, which belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) family of CAMs, mediate $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-independent cell-cell adhesion in neural and other tissues.
- The combinatorial and sequential interaction of several types of CAMs (e.g., selectins, integrins, and ICAMs) is critical for the specific adhesion of different types of leukocytes to endothelial cells in response to local signals induced by infection or inflammation (see Figure 20-40).

### 20.6 Plant Tissues

We turn now to the assembly of plant cells into tissues. The overall structural organization of plants is generally simpler than that of animals. For instance, plants have only four broad types of cells, which in mature plants form four basic classes of tissue: dermal tissue interacts with the environment, vascular tissue transports water and dissolved substances such as sugars and ions, space-filling ground tissue constitutes the major sites of metabolism, and sporogenous tissue forms the reproductive organs. Plant tissues are organized into just four main organ systems: stems have support and transport functions, roots provide anchorage and absorb and store nutrients, leaves are the sites of photosynthesis, and flowers enclose the reproductive structures. Thus, at the cell, tissue, and organ levels, plants are generally less complex than most animals.

Moreover, unlike animals, plants do not replace or repair old or damaged cells or tissues; they simply grow new organs. Indeed, the developmental fate of any given plant cell is primarily based on its position in the organism rather than on its lineage, whereas both are important in animals (see Chapter 21). In both plants and animals, a cell's direct communication with its neighbors is important. Most important for this chapter, and in contrast with animals, few cells in plants contact one another directly through molecules incorporated into their plasma membranes. Instead, plant cells are typically surrounded by a rigid cell wall that contacts the cell walls of adjacent cells (Figure 20-41a). Also in contrast with
animal cells, a plant cell rarely changes its position in the organism relative to other cells. These features of plants and their organization have determined the distinctive molecular mechanisms by which plant cells are incorporated into tissues and communicate with one another.

## The Plant Cell Wall Is a Laminate of Cellulose Fibrils in a Matrix of Glycoproteins

The plant cell wall, an extracellular matrix that is mainly composed of polysaccharides and is about $0.2 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick, completely coats the outside of the plant cell's plasma membrane. This structure serves some of the same functions as the ECM produced by animal cells, even though the two structures are composed of entirely different macromolecules and have a different organization. About 1000 genes in the plant Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant also called "thale cress" (see Chapters 1 and 8), are devoted to the synthesis and functioning of its cell wall, including approximately 414 glycosyltransferase genes and more than 316 glycosyl hydrolase genes. Similar to animal ECMs, the plant cell wall organizes cells into tissues, signals a plant cell to grow and divide, and controls the shapes of plant organs. It is a dynamic structure that plays important roles in controlling the differentiation of plant cells during embryogenesis and growth, and it provides a barrier to protect against pathogen infection. Just as the ECM helps define the shapes of animal cells, the cell wall defines the shapes of plant cells. When the cell wall is digested

away from plant cells by hydrolytic enzymes, spherical cells enclosed by a plasma membrane are left.

Because a major function of the plant cell wall is to withstand the turgor pressure of the cell (between 14.5 and 435 pounds per square inch; see Chapter 11), the cell wall is built for lateral strength. It is arranged into layers of cellulose microfibrils: bundles of 30-36 parallel chains of extensively hydrogen-bonded, long (as much as $7 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ or greater), linear polymers of glucose in $\beta$ glycosidic linkages. The cellulose microfibrils are embedded in a matrix composed of pectin, a negatively charged polymer of D-galacturonic acid and other monosaccharides, and hemicellulose, a short, highly branched polymer of several five- and six-carbon monosaccharides. The mechanical strength of the cell wall depends on cross-linking of the microfibrils by hemicellulose chains (Figure 20-41b, c). The layers of microfibrils prevent the cell wall from stretching laterally. Cellulose microfibrils are synthesized on the exoplasmic face of the plasma membrane from UDP-glucose and ADP-glucose formed in the cytosol. The polymerizing enzyme, called cellulose synthase, moves within the plane of the plasma membrane along tracks of intracellular microtubules as cellulose is formed, providing a distinctive mechanism for intracellular-extracellular communication and ensuring that the cellulose microfibrils are oriented properly to permit cell-wall, and thus whole-cell, growth.

Unlike cellulose, pectin and hemicellulose are synthesized in the Golgi complex and transported to the cell surface, where they form an interlinked network that helps bind the walls of adjacent cells to one another and cushions them. When purified, pectin binds water and forms a gel in the presence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and borate ions-hence the use of pectins in many processed foods. As much as 15 percent of the cell wall may be composed of extensin, a glycoprotein that contains abundant hydroxyproline and serine. Most of the hydroxyproline residues are linked to short chains of arabinose (a five-carbon monosaccharide), and the serine residues are linked to galactose. Carbohydrate accounts for about 65 percent of extensin by weight, and its protein backbone forms an extended rodlike helix with the hydroxyl or $O$-linked carbohydrates protruding outward. Lignin-a complex, insoluble polymer of phenolic residues-associates with cellulose and is a strengthening material. Like cartilage proteoglycans, lignin resists compression forces.

The cell wall is a selective filter whose permeability is controlled largely by pectins. Whereas water and ions diffuse freely across cell walls, the diffusion of large molecules, including proteins larger than 20 kDa , is limited. This limitation may explain why many plant hormones are small, water-soluble molecules, which can diffuse across the cell wall and interact with receptors in the plasma membrane of plant cells.

## Loosening of the Cell Wall Permits Plant Cell Growth

Because the cell wall surrounding a plant cell prevents it from expanding, the wall's structure must be loosened when
the cell grows. The amount, type, and direction of plant-cell growth are regulated by small-molecule hormones called auxins. The auxin-induced weakening of the cell wall permits the expansion of the intracellular vacuole (see Figure 20-41a) by uptake of water, leading to elongation of the cell. We can grasp the magnitude of this phenomenon by considering that, if all cells in a redwood tree were reduced to the size of a typical liver cell, the tree would have a maximum height of only 1 meter, about a hundredfold less than normal.

The cell wall undergoes its greatest changes at the meristem in a root or shoot tip. Meristems are where cells divide and grow, as described in Chapter 21. Young meristematic cells are connected by thin primary cell walls, which can be loosened and stretched to allow subsequent cell elongation. After cell elongation ceases, the cell wall is generally thickened, either by the secretion of additional macromolecules into the primary wall or, more usually, by the formation of a secondary cell wall composed of several layers. In mature tissues such as the xylem-the tubes that conduct salts and water from the roots through the stems to the leaves-most of the cell eventually degenerates, leaving only the cell wall. The unique properties of wood and of plant fibers such as cotton are due to the molecular properties of the cell walls in the tissues of origin.

## Plasmodesmata Directly Connect the Cytosols of Adjacent Cells

The presence of a cell wall separating cells in plants imposes barriers to cell-cell communication-and thus cell differen-tiation-not faced by animals. One distinctive mechanism used by plant cells to communicate directly is specialized cell junctions called plasmodesmata, which extend through the cell wall (Figure 20-42). Like gap junctions, plasmodesmata are channels that connect the cytosol of a cell with that of an adjacent cell. The diameter of the channel is about 30-60 nm , and its length can vary, but may be greater than $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. The density of plasmodesmata varies depending on the plant and cell type, and even the smallest meristematic cells have more than a thousand connections with their neighbors. An adapter protein called NET1A is thought to link the plasmodesmata to the actin cytoskeleton. Although a variety of proteins and polysaccharides that are physically or functionally associated with plasmodesmata have been identified, the key structural protein components of plasmodesmata and the detailed mechanisms underlying their biogenesis remain to be identified.

Molecules smaller than about 1000 Da , including a variety of metabolic and signaling compounds (ions, sugars, amino acids), can generally diffuse through plasmodesmata. However, the size of the channel through which molecules pass is highly regulated. In some circumstances, the channel is clamped shut; in others, it is dilated sufficiently to permit the passage of molecules larger than $10,000 \mathrm{Da}$. The deposition and breakdown of a glucose polymer called callose in the extracellular spaces adjacent to the entrances of the channels (see Figure 20-42a) is thought to regulate the

![li5435345559](li5435345559.jpg)

FIGURE 20-42 Plasmodesmata. (a) Schematic model of plasmodesmata, showing the desmotubule, an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and the annulus, a plasma-membrane-lined channel filled with cytosol that interconnects the cytosols of adjacent cells. The regulated deposition of a glucose polymer called callose (cyan) in the extracellular spaces in the cell wall adjacent to the entrances of the channels has the potential to block intercellular transport through the plasmodesmata, apparently by forcing the closing of the channels by narrowing the annulus. (b) Electron micrographs of thin sections of a sugarcane leaf (brackets indicate individual plasmodesmata). Left: Longitudinal view, showing ER and desmotubule running through each annulus. Right: Perpendicular cross-sectional views of plasmodesmata, in some of which spoke structures connecting the plasma membrane to the desmotubule can be seen. [Part (b) republished with permission of Springer, from Robinson-Beers, K. and Evert, R.F., "Fine structure of plasmodesmata in mature leaves of sugarcane," Planta, 1991, 184(3):307-18; permission conveyed through the Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.]
closing and opening of the channels, respectively. Among the factors that affect the permeability of plasmodesmata is the cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration: an increase in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ reversibly inhibits movement of molecules through these structures.

Although plasmodesmata and gap junctions resemble each other functionally with respect to forming channels for small-molecule diffusion, their structures differ
dramatically in two significant ways (see Figure 20-42). In plasmodesmata, the plasma membranes of the adjacent plant cells merge to form a continuous channel, called the annulus, whereas the plasma membranes of animal cells at a gap junction are not continuous with each other. There are simple plasmodesmata (with a single pore, like those in Figure 20-42) and complex plasmodesmata that branch into multiple channels. In addition, plasmodesmata exhibit many additional complex structural and functional characteristics. For example, they contain within the channel an extension of the endoplasmic reticulum, called a desmotubule, that passes through the annulus. They also have a variety of specialized proteins at the entrance of the channel and running throughout the length of the channel, including cytoskeletal, motor, and docking proteins that regulate the sizes and types of molecules that can pass through the channel. Many types of molecules spread from cell to cell through plasmodesmata, including some transcription factors, nucleic acid/protein complexes, metabolic products, and plant viruses. It appears that some of these require special chaperones to facilitate transport. Specialized kinases may also phosphorylate plasmodesmal components to regulate their activities (e.g., opening of the channels). Soluble molecules pass through the cytosolic annulus, about 3-4 nm in diameter, that lies between the plasma membrane and desmotubule, whereas membrane-bound molecules or certain proteins within the ER lumen can pass from cell to cell via the desmotubule. Plasmodesmata appear to play an especially important role in protection from pathogens and in regulating the development of plant cells and tissues, as is suggested by their ability to mediate intracellular movement of transcription factors and ribonuclear protein complexes.

## Tunneling Nanotubes Resemble Plasmodesmata and Transfer Molecules and Organelles Between Animal Cells

Tunneling nanotubes are tubelike projections of the plasma membrane that form a continuous channel connecting the cytosols of animal cells (Figure 20-43) and can transfer chemical and electrical signals between cells in a manner analogous to plasmodesmata in plants. Tunneling nanotubes are typically unbranched, straight tubes and can have a wide variety of diameters ( $50-300 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) and lengths (extending between cells from $<10 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ to $>100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, they can thus can be longer than several cell diameters). All tunneling nanotubes have actin filaments passing through the central channel, and in some types of cells they also contain microtubules. There is no evidence for endoplasmic reticulum passing through tunneling nanotubes, as is the case for plasmodesmata. Remarkably, functional mitochondria can travel between cells by passing through tunneling nanotubes in cell culture (see Figure 20-43) and in vivo, thereby rescuing receiving cells that have mitochondrial defects or deficiencies. Thus the concept of metabolic coupling described in Section 20.2 can be extended to include the movement

![li5535345559](li5535345559.jpg)

Cultured human retinal pigment epithelial cells (ARPE-19 cell line) were incubated with a fluorescent dye (JC-1) that specifically stains mitochondria and then examined by a combination of conventional brightfield microscopy (see Chapter 4) to visualize the cells and fluorescence microscopy to visualize mitochondria (green intracellular fluorescence). A typical tunneling nanotube can be seen connecting cells 1 and 2. Inset (a) shows a higher magnification of the bright-field-only image with two bulges in the tunneling nanotube highlighted by dashed circles. Inset (b) shows a higher magnification of the same region of the combination image indicating two likely mitochondria within the tunneling nanotube at the positions of those bulges.

of small molecules and organelles through tunneling nanotubes. Pathogens may also use tunneling nanotubes to spread between cells.

## Only a Few Adhesion Molecules Have Been Identified in Plants

Systematic analyses of the Arabidopsis genome and biochemical analyses of other plant species have provided no evidence for the existence of plant homologs of most animal CAMs, adhesion receptors, and ECM components. This finding is not surprising, given the dramatically different nature of cell-cell and cell-ECM interactions in animals and plants.

Among the adhesive proteins apparently unique to plants are five wall-associated kinases (WAKs) and WAK-like proteins expressed in the plasma membrane of Arabidopsis cells. These transmembrane proteins have a cytoplasmic serine/ threonine kinase domain, and their extracellular regions contain multiple epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats, frequently found in animal cell-surface receptors. Some

WAKs have an extracellular pectin-binding domain that can recognize and bind full-length pectin and pectin degradation fragments. Such binding has been proposed to help cells monitor and respond to the status of the cell wall during normal growth and in the context of cell-wall damage (wounding) or infection by pathogens. Thus some WAKS in plant cells appear to be analogous to adhesion receptors in animal cells, binding and sensing the ECM and mediating outside-in signaling.

The results of in vitro binding assays, combined with in vivo studies and analyses of plant mutants, have identified several macromolecules in the ECM that are important for adhesion. For example, normal adhesion of pollen, which contains sperm cells, to the stigma or style in the female reproductive organ of the Easter lily requires a cysteine-rich protein called stigma/stylar cysteine-rich adhesin (SCA) and a specialized pectin that can bind to SCA (Figure 20-44). A small, probably ECM-embedded, $10-\mathrm{kDa}$ protein called chymocyanin works in conjunction with SCA to help direct the movement of the sperm-containing pollen tube (chemotaxis) to the ovary.
![li5635345559](li5635345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 20-44 An in vitro assay was used to identify molecules required for adherence of pollen tubes to the stylar ECM. In this assay, ECM collected from lily styles (SE) or an artificial ECM was dried on nitrocellulose membranes (NC). Pollen tubes containing sperm were then added, and their binding to the dried ECM was assessed. In this scanning electron micrograph, the tips of pollen tubes (arrows) can be seen binding to dried stylar ECM. This type of assay has shown that pollen adherence depends on stigma/stylar cysteine-rich adhesin (SCA) and a pectin that binds to SCA. [Republished with permission of Springer, from Guang Yuh, J., et al., "Adhesion of lily pollen tubes on an artificial matrix," Sex. Plant Reprod., 1997, 10:3, pp. 173-180.]

Disruption of the gene encoding glucuronyltransferase 1, a key enzyme in pectin biosynthesis, has provided a striking illustration of the importance of pectins in intercellular adhesion in plant meristems. Normally, specialized pectin molecules help hold the cells in meristems tightly together. When grown in culture as a cluster of relatively undifferentiated cells, called a callus, normal meristematic cells adhere tightly and can differentiate into chlorophyll-producing cells, giving the callus a green color. Eventually the callus will generate shoots. In contrast, mutant cells with an inactivated glucuronyltransferase 1 gene are large, associate loosely with one another, and do not differentiate normally, forming a yellow callus. The introduction of a normal glucuronyltransferase 1 gene into the mutant cells restores their ability to adhere and differentiate normally.

The paucity of plant adhesion molecules identified to date, in contrast to the many well-defined animal adhesion molecules, may be due to the technical difficulties of working with the ECM/cell wall of plants. Adhesive interactions are likely to play different roles in plant and animal biology, at least in part because of the differences in development and physiology between plants and animals.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 20.6

## Plant Tissues

- The integration of cells into tissues in plants is fundamentally different from the assembly of animal tissues, primarily because each plant cell is surrounded by a relatively rigid cell wall.
- The plant cell wall comprises layers of cellulose microfibrils embedded within a matrix of hemicellulose, pectin, extensin, and other less abundant molecules.
- Cellulose, a large, linear glucose polymer, assembles spontaneously into microfibrils stabilized by hydrogen bonding.
- The cell wall defines the shapes of plant cells and restricts their elongation. Auxin-induced loosening of the cell wall permits cell elongation.
- Adjacent plant cells can communicate through plasmodesmata, junctions that allow molecules to pass through complex channels connecting the cytosols of adjacent cells (see Figure 20-42).
- Tunneling nanotubes in animal cells are somewhat analogous to plant plasmodesmata in that they are tubelike projections of plasma membranes that form a continuous channel connecting the cytosols of nearby cells (see Figure 20-43).
- Plants do not produce homologs of the common adhesion molecules found in animals. Only a few adhesion molecules in plants have been well documented to date.

Pluripotent stem cells called neoblasts provide the cellular basis for regeneration in planaria. Shown is a colony of neoblasts (red), all derived from a single neoblast 14 days after regeneration of the tail was initiated by amputation; differentiating cells (blue) are also shown.

Many descriptions of cell division imply that the parent cell gives rise to two daughter cells that look and function exactly like the parent cell. In other words, they imply that cell division is symmetric and that the progeny have properties similar to those of the parent (Figure 21-1a). Many yeasts, fungi, and other single-celled eukaryotes indeed divide this way. Mature liver cells-hepatocytes-also divide symmetrically, each giving rise to two daughter hepatocytes.

But if this were always the case, none of the hundreds of differentiated cell types and functioning tissues present in complex multicellular plants and animals would ever be formed. Differences among cells can arise when two initially identical daughter cells diverge upon receiving distinct developmental or environmental signals. Alternatively, the two daughter cells may differ from "birth," with each inheriting different portions of the parent cell (Figure 21-1b). Daughter cells produced by such asymmetric cell division may differ

in size, shape, or protein composition, or their genes may be in different states of activity or potential activity. The differences in these internal signals confer different fates on the two cells. In certain asymmetric cell divisions, one of the daughters is similar to the parent cell and the other forms a different type of cell.

In multicellular organisms, the formation of working tissues and organs, during both development and cell replacement, depends on specific patterns of mitotic cell divisions. A series of such cell divisions akin to a family tree is called a cell lineage. A cell lineage traces the birth order of cells as they progressively become more restricted in their developmental potential and differentiate into specialized cell types such as skin cells, neurons, or muscle cells (Figure 21-1c).

The development of a new metazoan organism begins with the egg, or oocyte, carrying a set of chromosomes from the mother, and the sperm, carrying a set of chromosomes

21.5 Cell Death and Its Regulation

![li5835345559](li5835345559.jpg)
from the father. These gametes, or sex cells, are haploid because they have gone through meiosis (see Chapter 19). In the process called fertilization, they combine to create the initial single cell, the zygote, which has two sets of chromosomes and is therefore diploid. During embryogenesis, the zygote undergoes numerous cell divisions, both symmetric and asymmetric, ultimately giving rise to an entire organism. As we will see later in the chapter (see Figure 21-25 below), many of the early divisions of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans follow a mosaic development strategy, in which all of the early cell divisions are asymmetric and each daughter cell gives rise to a discrete set of differentiated cell types because regulatory proteins located in cytoplasmic granules are unequally distributed to the daughter cells.

FIGURE 21-1 Overview of the birth, lineage, and death of cells. Following growth, daughter cells are "born" as the result of symmetric or asymmetric cell division. (a) The two daughter cells resulting from symmetric division are essentially identical to each other and to the parent cell. Such daughter cells can subsequently have different fates if they are exposed to different signals. (b) The two daughter cells resulting from asymmetric cell division differ from birth and consequently have different fates. In some cases (left), both daughter cells are different from each other and from the parent cell. In others (right), one daughter cell is essentially identical to the parent and the other assumes a different fate. Asymmetric division is common when the parent cell is a stem cell; this allows the number of stem cells (yellow) to remain constant while they continue to generate other cells (orange) that mature into one or more differentiated cell types. (c) A series of symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions, called a cell lineage, gives birth to each of the specialized cell types found in a multicellular organism. The cell lineage can be under tight genetic control. Programmed cell death occurs during normal development (e.g., in the webbing that initially develops when fingers grow) and in response to infection or toxins.

The focus of the first section of this chapter is early mammalian development and its regulation by cell-cell interactions. Both mouse and human embryos pass through an eight-cell stage in which each cell can still form every tissue (both embryonic and extraembryonic); that is, all eight cells are totipotent. At the sixteen-cell stage, this is no longer true: some of the cells have become committed to particular differentiation paths. In regulative development, the position of a given cell, rather than segregation of morphogens, is important in establishing cell fate. A group of cells called the inner cell mass will ultimately give rise to all tissues of the embryo proper, and another set of cells will form the placental tissue. Cells such as those in the inner mass that can generate all embryonic tissues, but not extraembryonic tissues, are called pluripotent.

Stem cells are important during both metazoan development and adult life. They are unspecialized cells that can reproduce themselves as well as generate specific types of more specialized cells (see Figure 21-1b). Their name comes from the image of a plant stem, which grows upward, continuing to form more stem, while also sending off leaves and branches to the side. In the second and third sections of this chapter, we explore several types of stem cells that differ in the variety of specialized cell types they can form. Stem cells can undergo symmetric divisions in which both of the daughters are stem cells. Many types of stem cells in animals and plants undergo asymmetric divisions in which one of the daughter cells is a stem cell. Thus the numbers of stem cells can remain constant or can increase during the organism's life. The zygote is totipotent in that it has the capacity to generate every cell type in the body as well as the supportive placental cells that are required for embryonic development, but because the zygote does not self-renew (make more of itself), it is not considered a stem cell.

In Section 21.2, we will learn that cells of the inner cell mass can be cultured in defined media, forming embryonic stem (ES) cells. ES cells can be grown indefinitely in culture, where they divide symmetrically, so that each daughter cell remains pluripotent and can potentially give rise to all of the tissues of an animal. We will discuss the use of ES cells in uncovering the transcriptional network of gene expression underlying pluripotency as well as in forming specific types of differentiated cells for research purposes or, potentially, as "replacement parts" for worn-out or diseased cells in patients.

For many years, animal cell differentiation was thought to be unidirectional, but recent data reveal that differentiation can be reversed experimentally. Through recombinant expression of specific transcription factors, one type of specialized, differentiated cell can be converted into another type of differentiated cell. Strikingly, introducing just a small number of the transcription factors that control the pluripotency of ES cells into multiple types of differentiated cells, under defined conditions, can convert at least some of those somatic cells into induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that have properties seemingly indistinguishable from those of ES cells. As we will see in Section 21.2, iPS cells have profound utility for experimental biology and medicine.

Many types of cells have life spans much shorter than that of the organism as a whole and so need to be constantly replaced. In mammals, for instance, cells lining the intestine and phagocytic macrophages live for only a few days. Stem cells are therefore important not only during development, but also for replacement of worn-out cells in adult organisms. Unlike ES cells, the stem cells in adults are multipotent: they can give rise to some of the types of differentiated cells found in the organism, but not all of them. In the third section of this chapter, we discuss several examples of multipotent stem cells, including those that give rise to germ cells, intestinal cells, and the variety of cell types found in blood.

We have already mentioned that the diversity of cell types in an animal requires asymmetric cell divisions in which the fates of the two daughter cells differ. This process requires the parent cell to become asymmetric, or polarized, before cell division, so that the cell contents are unequally distributed between the two daughters. This process of polarization is critical not only during development, but also for the function of essentially all cells. For example, transporting epithelial cells, such as those that line the intestine, are polarized, with their free apical surface facing the lumen to absorb nutrients and their basolateral surface contacting the extracellular matrix to transport nutrients toward the blood (see Figures 11-30 and 20-1). Other examples include cells that migrate up a chemotactic gradient (see Figure 18-53) and neurons, which have multiple dendrites extending from one side of the cell body that receive signals and a single axon extending from the other side that transmits signals to target cells (see Chapter 22). Thus the mechanisms that cells use to polarize are important and general aspects of their function. Not surprisingly, these mechanisms integrate elements of cell signaling pathways (see Chapters 15 and 16), cytoskeletal
reorganization (see Chapters 17 and 18), and membrane trafficking (see Chapter 14). In the fourth section of this chapter, we discuss how cells become polarized as well as the importance of asymmetric cell division for maintaining stem cells and generating differentiated cells.

Typically, we think of cell fates in terms of the differentiated cell types that are formed. A quite different cell fate, programmed cell death, is also absolutely crucial in the formation and maintenance of many tissues. A precise genetic regulatory system, with checks and balances, controls cell death, just as other genetic programs control cell division and differentiation. In the last section of this chapter, we consider the mechanisms of cell death and their regulation.

These aspects of cell biology—cell birth, the establishment of cell polarity, and programmed cell death-converge with developmental biology, and they are among the most important processes regulated by the signaling pathways discussed in earlier chapters.

### 21.1 Early Mammalian Development

The main focus of this section is on the first cell divisions during early mammalian development; the following section discusses the properties of embryonic stem cells and iPS cells. We start with an explanation of how a single sperm is allowed to fuse with an egg, generating a zygote with a diploid genome from these two haploid germ cells.

## Fertilization Unifies the Genome

It is remarkable that a mammalian sperm is ever able to reach and penetrate an egg. For one thing, in humans, each sperm is competing with more than 100 million other sperm for a single oocyte. What's more, the sperm must swim an incredible distance to reach the egg (if a sperm were the size of a person, the distance traveled would be equivalent to several miles!). And once there, the sperm must fight its way through multiple layers surrounding the egg that restrict sperm entry (Figure 21-2a). Sperm are streamlined for speed and swimming ability. The human sperm flagellum (see Chapter 18) contains about 9000 dynein motors that flex microtubules in the $50-\mu \mathrm{m}$ axoneme. Nevertheless, only a few dozen sperm will reach the oocyte.

As shown in Figure 21-2, once it reaches the egg, a sperm must first penetrate a layer of cumulus cells that surround the oocyte and then the zona pellucida, a gelatinous extracellular matrix composed largely of three glycoproteins called ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3. The acrosome, found at the sperm's leading tip, is a membrane-bounded compartment specialized for interaction with the oocyte. One side of the acrosomal membrane lies just under the plasma membrane at the sperm head; the opposite side of the acrosomal membrane is juxtaposed to the nuclear membrane. Inside the acrosome are soluble enzymes, including hydrolases and proteases. Once in proximity to the oocyte, the acrosome

![li5935345559](li5935345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-2 Gamete fusion during fertilization. (a) Mammalian eggs, such as the mouse oocyte shown here, are surrounded by a ring of translucent material, the zona pellucida, which provides a binding matrix for sperm. The diameter of a mouse egg is $\sim 70 \mu \mathrm{~m}$, and the zona pellucida is $\sim 6 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ thick. The polar body is a nonfunctional product of meiosis. (b) In the initial stage of fertilization (step 1), the sperm penetrates a layer of cumulus cells surrounding the egg to reach the zona pellucida. Interactions between GalT, a protein on the sperm surface, and ZP3, a glycoprotein in the zona pellucida, trigger the acrosomal reaction (step 2), which releases enzymes from the acrosome. Degradation of the zona pellucida by hydrolases and proteases released by the acrosomal reaction allows the sperm to begin entering the egg (step 3). Specific recognition proteins on the surfaces of egg and sperm facilitate fusion of their plasma membranes. Membrane fusion and the subsequent entry of the first sperm nucleus into the egg cytoplasm (steps 1 and 2) trigger the release of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ within the oocyte. Cortical granules (orange) respond to the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ surge by fusing with the oocyte membrane and releasing enzymes that act on the zona pellucida to prevent binding of additional sperm. [Part (a) Douglas Kline.]
(b)

undergoes exocytosis, releasing its contents onto the surface of the oocyte (Figure 21-2b, step $\mathbf{B}$ ). The enzymes digest the multiple egg surface layers to begin the process of sperm entry. It's a race, and the first sperm to succeed triggers a dramatic response by the oocyte that prevents polyspermy, the entry of other sperm that would bring in excess chromosomes.

After the first sperm succeeds in fusing with the oocyte membrane, a flux of calcium flows into the oocyte cytosol, spreading outward from the site of sperm entry. As in other regulated secretory pathways, one of the effects of the rise in calcium is to trigger fusion of vesicles located just under the plasma membrane of the egg, called cortical granules, with the plasma membrane, releasing their contents to the outside of the plasma membrane and forming a shielding fertilization membrane that blocks other sperm from entering. Finally the sperm nucleus enters the egg cytoplasm, and the egg and sperm nuclei soon fuse to create the diploid zygote nucleus.

Oocytes bring with them to the union a considerable dowry. They contain multiple mitochondria, with their mitochondrial DNA, whose inheritance is exclusively maternal; in mammals and many other species, no sperm mitochondrial DNA enters the oocyte (see Chapter 12). Femalespecific mitochondrial DNA inheritance has been used to trace maternal heritage in human history; it has been used, for example, to follow early humans from their origins in Africa. The egg cytoplasm is also packed with maternal $m R N A$ : transcripts of genes whose products are essential for the earliest stages of development. There is little or no transcription during oocyte meiosis and the first embryonic cleavages, so during this time the oocyte's mRNA is crucial.

## Cleavage of the Mammalian Embryo Leads to the First Differentiation Events

The fertilized egg, or zygote, does not remain a single cell for long. Fertilization is quickly followed by cleavage, a series of cell divisions that take about one day each (Figure 21-3); these divisions happen before the embryo is implanted in the uterine wall. Initially, the cells are fairly spherical and loosely attached to one another. As demonstrated experimentally in
sheep, each cell at the 8 -cell stage is totipotent and has the potential to give rise to a complete animal when implanted into the uterus of a pseudopregnant animal (one treated with hormones to make her uterus responsive to embryos).

Three days after fertilization, the 8 -cell embryo divides again to form the 16 -cell morula (from the Greek for "raspberry"), after which the cell affinities for one another increase substantially and the embryo undergoes compaction, a process that depends in part on the cell-surface homotypic cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin (see Figure 20-14). The compaction process driven by increased cell-cell adhesion initially results in a more solid mass of cells, the compacted morula. In the next step, some of the cell-cell adhesions diminish locally, and fluid begins to flow into an internal cavity called the blastocoel. Additional divisions produce a blastocyst (see Figure 21-3).

The blastocyst is composed of approximately 64 cells that have separated into two cell types: trophectoderm (TE), which will form extraembryonic tissues such as the placenta, and the inner cell mass (ICM) (just 10-15 cells in a mouse), which gives rise to the embryo proper (Figure 21-4a). In the blastocyst, the ICM is found on one side of the blastocoel, while the TE cells form a hollow ball around the ICM and blastocoel. At this point, the TE cells are in an epithelial sheet, while the ICM cells are a loose mass that can be described as mesenchyme. Mesenchyme, a term most commonly applied to mesoderm-derived cells, refers to loosely organized and loosely attached cells.

The fate of a cell in the early embryo-TE or ICM-is determined by the cell's location. If a labeled cell is placed on the outside of a very early embryo, it is likely to form extraembryonic tissues, while a cell placed inside an embryo is likely to form embryonic tissues (Figure 21-4b, c). Gene expression measurements of each stage of early development show dramatic changes in which genes are expressed. Even these very early embryos use Wnt, Notch, and TGF- $\beta$ signals to regulate gene expression (see Chapter 16).

Both ICM and TE cells are stem cells: each starts its own distinct lineage and divides prolifically to produce diverse populations of cells. It is the ICM stem cells that we turn our attention to in the next section.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-4 Cell location determines cell fate in the early embryo. (a) A four-cell embryo normally develops into a blastocyst consisting of trophectoderm (TE) cells on the outside and inner cell mass (ICM) cells inside. (b) In order to discover whether position affects the fates of cells, transplantation experiments were done with mouse embryos. First, recipient morula-stage embryos had cells removed to make room for implanted cells. Then donor morula-stage (sixteen-cell) embryos were soaked in a dye that does not transfer between cells. Finally, labeled cells from the donor embryos were injected into inner or outer regions of the recipient embryos, as shown in the micrograph. The recipient embryo was held
in place by a slight vacuum applied to the holding pipette. (c) The subsequent fates of the descendants of the transplanted labeled cells were monitored. For simplicity, four-cell recipient embryos are depicted, although morula-stage embryos were used as both donors and recipients. The results, summarized in the graphs, show that outer cells overwhelmingly form trophectoderm and that inner cells tend to become part of the ICM, but also form considerable trophectoderm.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 21.1

## Early Mammalian Development

- In asymmetric cell division, two different types of daughter cells are formed from one parent cell. In contrast, both daughter cells formed in symmetric cell divisions are identical, but may have different fates if they are exposed to different external signals (see Figure 21-1).
- Specialized sperm and egg surface proteins allow the nucleus of a single mammalian sperm to enter the cytoplasm of an egg. Fusion of a haploid sperm and haploid egg nucleus generates a diploid zygote (see Figure 21-2).
- The initial divisions of the mammalian embryo yield equivalent totipotent cells, but subsequent divisions yield the first differentiation event, the separation of the trophectoderm from the inner cell mass (see Figures 21-3 and 21-4).


### 21.2 Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

In this section, we discuss two types of pluripotent mammalian cells: embryonic stem (ES) cells and induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. Our focus is on the network of genes and proteins that regulate the pluripotent state of these cells and can subsequently lead to multiple types of differentiated cells. In culture, these two types of pluripotent cells can be
used to form specific types of differentiated cells for research purposes or, potentially, as "replacement parts" for wornout or diseased cells in patients. iPS cells can be formed from patients with many types of diseases and then differentiated into the specific cell type affected by the disease; here we see how study of such cells can illuminate crucial underlying causes of a specific individual's disease.

## The Inner Cell Mass Is the Source of ES Cells

Embryonic stem cells can be isolated from the inner cell mass of early mammalian embryos and grown indefinitely in culture when attached to a feeder-cell layer that provides certain essential growth factors (Figure 21-5a). As mentioned in the chapter introduction, cultured ES cells are pluripotent: they can differentiate into a wide range of cell types of the three primary germ layers, either in culture or after reinsertion into a host embryo. More specifically, mouse ES cells can be injected into the blastocoel of an early mouse embryo and the cell aggregate surgically transplanted into the uterus of a pseudopregnant female. The injected ES cells will participate in forming most, if not all, tissues of the resultant chimeric mice (see Figure 6-38). Furthermore, the injected ES cells will often give rise to functional sperm and eggs that, in turn, can generate normal live mice.

In a more recent variation on these experiments, the host blastocyst is treated with drugs that transiently block mitosis so that its cells become tetraploid (with four copies of each chromosome, incapable of forming differentiated cells and tissues), in contrast to the diploid ES cells that are injected

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-5 Embryonic stem (ES) cells can be maintained in culture and can form differentiated cell types. (a) Human or mouse blastocysts are grown from cleavage-stage embryos produced by in vitro fertilization. The ICM is separated from the surrounding extraembryonic tissues and plated onto a layer of fibroblast cells, which help to nourish the embryonic cells by providing specific protein hormones. When individual cells are replated, they form colonies of ES cells, which can be maintained for many generations and can be stored frozen. ES cells can also be cultured without a fibroblast feeder layer if specific cytokines are added; leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), for instance, supports growth of mouse ES cells by triggering activation of the Stat3 transcription factor; see J. S. Odorico et al., 2001, Stem Cells 19:193. (b) Embryonic stem cells allowed to differentiate in suspension culture become multicellular aggregates termed embryoid bodies. (c) Hematoxylin- and eosin-stained sections of embryoid bodies that contain derivatives of all three germ layers that are formed from the ICM during embryogenesis. Arrows in the images point to the following tissue types: (left) gut epithelium (endoderm), (middle) cartilage (mesoderm), and (right) neuroepithelial rosettes (ectoderm). Black bar $=100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$. [Parts (b) and (c) courtesy of Dr. Lauren Surface and Dr. Laurie Boyer]
into the blastocyst. In this case, all the cells in the live mice that are born after transplantation of the blastocyst aggregate derive from the donor ES cells. This finding is powerful evidence that single mouse ES cells are indeed pluripotent. Because ethical considerations and, in many countries, legal restrictions preclude similar transplantation experiments with human ES cells, formal proof that they are pluripotent is lacking.

Importantly, both human and mouse ES cells can differentiate into a wide range of cell types in culture. When cultured in suspension, ES cells form multicellular aggregates, called embryoid bodies (Figure 21-5b), that resemble early embryos in the variety of tissues they form. When embryoid bodies are subsequently treated with various combinations of growth factors or transferred to a solid surface, they produce a variety of differentiated cell types, including gut epithelia, cartilage, and neural cells (Figure 21-5c). Under other
conditions, ES cells have been induced to differentiate in culture into precursors for various specific cell types, including blood cells and pigmented epithelia; for this reason, ES cells have proved extremely useful in identifying the factors that commit a pluripotent cell to differentiating down a particular cell lineage.

What properties give these cells of the early embryo their remarkable plasticity? As we'll see in the next section, a variety of actors play a role: DNA methylation, transcription factors, chromatin regulators, and micro-RNAs all affect which genes become active.

## Multiple Factors Control the Pluripotency of ES Cells

During the earliest stages of embryogenesis, as the zygote begins to divide, both the paternal and maternal DNA become

demethylated (see the discussion of DNA methylation in Chapter 9). This happens in part because a key maintenance methyl transferase, Dnmt1, is transiently excluded from the nucleus and in part because demethylase enzymes actively remove or "erase" methylation marks from 5-methyl cytosine residues during early development. As a result, the pattern of DNA methylation is reset during the first few cell divisions, erasing earlier epigenetic marking of the DNA and creating conditions in which cells have greater potential for diverse pathways of development. Mice engineered to lack Dnmt1 die as early embryos with drastically undermethylated DNA. ES cells prepared from such embryos are able to divide in culture, but in contrast to normal ES cells, cannot undergo in vitro differentiation.

ES cell properties are also critically dependent on the action of master transcription factors produced shortly after fertilization. The transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog have essential roles in early development and are required for the specification of ICM cells in the embryo as well as for the specification of ES cells in culture. The expression of Oct4 and Nanog is exclusive to pluripotent cells such as the cells of the ICM and cultured ES cells. Sox2 is found in pluripotent cells, but its expression is also necessary in the multipotent neural stem cells that give rise exclusively to neuronal and glial cell types (discussed in Chapter 22). Genetic studies in the mouse suggest that these three regulators have distinct roles, but may function in related pathways to maintain the developmental potential of pluripotent cells. For example, disruption of Oct4 or Sox2 results in the inappropriate differentiation of ICM and ES cells into trophectoderm. However, forced expression of Oct4 in ES cells leads to a phenotype that is similar to that caused by loss of Nanog function. Thus knowledge of the set of genes regulated by these transcription factors might reveal their essential roles during development.

The genes that are bound by these three transcription factors have been identified using chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments (see Chapter 9); each protein is found at more than a thousand chromosomal locations. The target genes encode a wide variety of proteins, including the Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins themselves, forming an autoregulatory loop in which each of these three transcription factors induces its own expression as well as that of the others (Figure 21-6). These transcription factors also bind to the transcription-control regions of many genes encoding proteins and micro-RNAs important for the proliferation and self-renewal of ES cells.

Several protein hormones are provided by feeder cells or added to culture media to prevent differentiation of ES cells. These hormones include leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), which activates Stat3; Wnt, which activates the $\beta$-catenin transcription factor; and bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), which activates the Smad1 transcription factor (see Chapter 16). In ES cells, these three transcription factors bind at multiple genomic sites co-occupied by Oct4, Nanog, and Sox2 proteins. Thus signaling pathways activated by cell-surface receptors are directly coupled to regulation of

FIGURE 21-6 Transcriptional network regulating pluripotency of ES cells. Each of three master transcription factors, Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog, binds to its own promoter as well as to the promoters of the other two (black lines), forming a positive autoregulatory loop that activates transcription of each of these genes. These transcription factors also bind to the transcription-control regions of many active genes encoding proteins and micro-RNAs important for the proliferation and self-renewal of ES cells as well as to those of many genes that are silenced in undifferentiated ES cells and that encode proteins and micro-RNAs essential for the formation of many differentiated cell types (magenta lines).

genes in the core pluripotency circuitry; this observation reinforces a point made in Chapter 16 that transcription factors activated by cell-surface receptors frequently bind at sites in the genome occupied by master transcription factors specific to that type of cell.

Chromatin regulators that control gene transcription (see Chapter 9) are also important in ES cells. In Drosophila, Polycomb group proteins form complexes to maintain gene repression states that have been previously established by DNA-binding transcription factors. Two mammalian protein complexes related to the fly Polycomb proteins, PRC1 and PRC2 (see Figure 9-48), are abundant in ES cells. Early mouse embryos lacking components of PRC2 display early developmental defects. The PRC2 complex acts by adding methyl groups to lysine 27 of histone H 3 , thus altering chromatin structure to repress genes. (Note that the methylation here is on an amino acid in a protein, a type of regulation distinct from the methylation of cytosine residues in DNA.) In ES cells, PRC1 and PRC2 both silence genes whose encoded proteins or micro-RNAs (miRNAs) would otherwise induce differentiation into particular types of cells; the Polycomb proteins also maintain these genes in an epigenetic "preactivation" state such that they are poised to become activated later as part of the proper execution of specific developmental gene expression programs. Thus ES cells lacking PRC2 functions fail to differentiate properly.

Many other regulators play important roles in controlling gene expression and maintaining pluripotency during very early development. For example, the gene encoding the miRNA let-7 is transcribed in ES cells, but the precursor RNA transcript is not cleaved to form the mature, functional miRNA. ES cells express a developmentally regulated RNA-binding protein termed Lin28 that binds to the let-7

precursor RNA and prevents its cleavage. Experimental expression of mature let-7 miRNA in ES cells blocks their ability to undergo self-renewal, and thus repression of let-7 processing by Lin28 is essential for pluripotency.

As we will see later, the possibility of using embryonic stem cells therapeutically to restore or replace damaged tissue is fueling much research on how to induce them to differentiate into specific cell types. Apart from their possible benefit in treating disease, ES cells have already proved invaluable for producing mouse mutants useful in studying a wide range of diseases, developmental mechanisms, behavior, and physiology. Using the recombinant DNA techniques described in Chapter 6, one can eliminate or modify the function of a specific gene in ES cells (see Figure 6-38). The mutated ES cells can then be employed to produce mice with a gene knockout (see Figure 6-39). Analysis of the effects of deleting or modifying a gene in this way often provides clues about the normal function of the gene and its encoded protein.

## Animal Cloning Shows That Differentiation Can Be Reversed

Although different cell types may transcribe different parts of the genome, for the most part the genome is identical in all cells. Segments of the genome are rearranged and lost during development of the T and B lymphocytes of the immune system from hematopoietic precursors (see Chapter 23), but most somatic cells appear to have an intact genome, equivalent to that in the germ line. Evidence that at least some somatic cells have a complete and functional genome comes from the successful production of cloned animals by nuclear transfer. In this procedure, often called somatic-cell nuclear transfer (SCNT), the nucleus of an adult somatic cell is introduced into an egg whose nucleus has been removed; the manipulated egg, which contains the diploid number of chromosomes and is equivalent to a zygote, is then implanted into a foster mother. The only source of genetic information to guide development of the embryo is the nuclear genome of the donor somatic cell. The low efficiency of generating cloned animals by SCNT, combined with a high frequency of diseases such as obesity in the animals that are cloned, however, raises questions about how many adult somatic cells do in fact have a complete functional genome and whether those that do can be completely reprogrammed into a pluripotent undifferentiated state. Even the successes, such as the famous cloned sheep "Dolly," have some medical problems. Even if differentiated cells have a physically complete genome, clearly only parts of it are transcriptionally active (see Chapter 9). A cell could, for example, have an intact genome, but be unable to properly reactivate specific genes due to inherited chromatin epigenetic states.

Further evidence that the genome of a differentiated cell can revert to having the full developmental potential characteristic of an ES cell comes from experiments in which olfactory sensory neurons-postmitotic cells that normally will not divide again-were genetically marked with green fluorescence protein (GFP) and then used as donors of nuclei
(Figure 21-7). When the nuclei from differentiated olfactory sensory neurons were implanted into enucleated mouse oocytes, a small fraction of them developed into blastocysts that produced GFP. The blastocysts were used to derive ES cell lines, which were then used to generate mouse embryos. These embryos, derived entirely from olfactory sensory neuron genomes, formed healthy green-fluorescing mice. Thus, at least in some cases, the genome of a differentiated cell can be reprogrammed completely to form all tissues of a mouse.

## Somatic Cells Can Generate iPS Cells

Because of the inefficiency of somatic-cell nuclear transfer, it remained unclear whether all types of somatic mammalian cells retained an intact genome and whether they could be induced to dedifferentiate into an ES cell-like state. Shinya Yamanaka used retrovirus vectors to express a wide variety of transcription factors, singly and in combination, in cultured fibroblast cells. Remarkably, he found that both human and mouse fibroblasts could be reprogrammed to a pluripotent state, called an induced pluripotent stem-cell state, similar to that of an embryonic stem cell, by transformation with retroviruses encoding just four proteins: KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and Myc. Note that two of these, Sox2 and Oct4, are two of the master transcription factors expressed in ES cells, as discussed previously. In addition to fibroblasts, keratinocytes (skin-forming cells) and other types of differentiated cells have been reprogrammed to iPS cells. Like ES cells, single mouse iPS cells can be experimentally introduced into a blastocyst and form all of the tissues of a mouse, including germ cells, attesting to the fact that somatic cells can indeed be reprogrammed to an embryonic pluripotent state.

Several other transcription factors, and even certain small organic molecules, can replace the Oct4 gene in the Yamanaka reprogramming "cocktail." Subsequent analysis led to the discovery that each of these factors directly activates transcription of the endogenous (cellular) Oct4 gene, leading to induction of pluripotency. Thus it was hypothesized that, over time, forced expression of transcriptionfactor genes activates expression of many cellular genes, including those encoding Oct4 and other pluripotency proteins; over the course of several weeks, this activation reprograms the somatic cells to an ES-like state. To experimentally establish the point that activation of endogenous genes leads to reprogramming to an ES-like state, cultured keratinocytes were repeatedly transfected with synthetic mRNAs encoding the four canonical Yamanaka transcription factors, KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and Myc. These cultured cells generated normal iPS cells that had no trace of any of the exogenously added mRNAs, attesting to the reprogramming of keratinocytes into iPS cells by inducing expression of only normal cellular genes.

In fibroblasts, the chromatin of most pluripotencyassociated genes is inaccessible to transcription-factor binding, primarily due to the repressive histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation ( $\mathrm{H} 3 \mathrm{K} 9 \mathrm{Me}_{3}$ ) mark. Among the genes

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-7 Mice can be cloned by somatic-cell nuclear transfer from olfactory neurons. (a) Procedure for generating cloned ES cell lines using nuclei from olfactory sensory neurons and using them to generate cloned mice. Step A nucleus from an olfactory sensory neuron isolated from a mouse that expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) only in its olfactory neurons was used to replace the nucleus of a mouse egg, and the resultant zygote was cultured to the blastocyst stage (step 1). The ICM cells, all of which were clones of the original olfactory sensory neuron, and all of which expressed GFP, were used to generate lines of ES cells (step 1). Step 1 These ES cells were injected into a tetraploid blastocyst.
activated by Oct4 are two that encode H3K9 demethylases, which remove these repressive chromatin marks and, over time, result in activation of pluripotency genes. Consistent with this notion, expression of these H3K9 demethylases increases during reprogramming, and their knockdown inhibits efficient iPS-cell generation. Indeed, reprogramming involves major changes in epigenetic modifications, including DNA methylation and several other types of histone modifications that serve to repress or allow potential activation of hundreds of genes.

Because iPS cells can be derived from somatic cells of patients with difficult-to-understand diseases, they have already proved invaluable in uncovering the molecular and cellular basis of several afflictions (Figure 21-8). Consider amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), often called Lou Gebrig's disease, a fatal disease in which the motor neurons that connect the spinal cord to the muscles of the body progressively die off, causing muscle weakness and death, limb paralysis, and ultimately death due to respiratory failure. There is no cure.

Step 2 When the blastocyst was transplanted into the uterus of a pseudopregnant mouse, the tetraploid cells from the host blastocyst could form the placenta (gray), but not the embryo proper; therefore, all of cells in the embryo proper and in the mouse that developed from it expressed GFP (step 1).

In approximately 10 percent of patients, the disease is dominantly inherited (familial ALS), but in 90 percent of patients, there is no apparent genetic linkage (sporadic ALS). An analysis of the underlying causes of the disease at a molecular and cellular level was impossible for many years because one cannot simply extract neurons or the surrounding glial cells from living humans and analyze or culture them.

In about 20 percent of patients with familial ALS, there is a point mutation in the gene SOD1, encoding $\mathrm{Cu} / \mathrm{Zn}$ superoxide dismutase 1 ; the mutant SOD1 protein forms aggregates that can damage cells. About 40 percent of patients with familial ALS and 10 percent of patients with the noninherited form have a mutation in the C9ORF72 gene (of unknown function; called chromosome 9 open reading frame 72). This mutation also often occurs in people with frontotemporal dementia, the second most common form of dementia after Alzheimer's disease, explaining why some people develop both diseases simultaneously. The mRNA transcribed from normal human C9ORF72 genes has up to 30 repeats of the hexanucleotide GGGGCC, but mutant ALS-causing genes can have up to thousands of these repeats.

![li6835345559](li6835345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-8 Medical applications of iPS cells. In this example, the patient has a neurodegenerative disorder caused by abnormalities in certain nerve cells (neurons). Patient-specific iPS cells-in this case derived by recombinant expression of transcription factors in cells isolated from a skin biopsy-can be used in one of two ways. In cases in which the disease-causing mutation is known (for example, familial Parkinson's disease), gene targeting could be used to repair the DNA sequence (right). The gene-corrected patient-specific iPS cells
would then undergo directed differentiation into the affected neuronal subtype (for example, midbrain dopaminergic neurons) and be transplanted into the patient's brain (to engraft the nigrostriatal axis). Alternatively, directed differentiation of the patient-specific iPS cells into the affected neuronal subtype (left) will allow the patient's disease to be modeled in vitro, and potential drugs can be screened, aiding in the discovery of novel therapeutic compounds. See D. A. Robinton and G. Q. Daley, 2012, Nature 481:295.

In several studies, iPS cells derived from the skin cells of elderly patients with these and other familial and sporadic forms of the disease were successfully differentiated in culture to form motor neurons; this success demonstrated the feasibility of leveraging the self-renewal of iPS cells to generate a potentially limitless supply of the cells specifically affected by ALS. One study showed that motor neurons bearing several types of ALS mutations were hyperexcitable, generating more of the electrical signals called action potentials (see Chapter 22) than normal. This excess excitability also caused the neurons to make more errors in protein folding and accumulate misfolded proteins, leading to aberrant cell function. In iPS-derived neurons from patients with the

C9ORF72 mutation, the RNAs containing the large numbers of repeating GGGGCC sequences were in aggregates, bound to multiple RNA-binding proteins important for normal cell functions; this binding prevented these proteins from catalyzing key steps in the production of other cellular mRNAs. Overall, the C9ORF72 mutation made the motor neurons produce abnormal amounts of many other cellular RNAs and made the cells very sensitive to stress.

In a separate study to dissect the molecular cause of ALS, motor neurons were generated from human ES or iPS cells and cultured with primary human astrocytes, a type of glial cell that surrounds neurons and regulates several of their functions (see Figure 22-17). Many of the motor neurons

died if the astrocytes expressed the mutant form of SOD1, but not if they expressed the wild-type form, suggesting that at least in this familial form of ALS, the defective cells are both astrocytes and motor neurons. Indeed, astrocytes expressing the mutant form of SOD1 secreted protein factors that were toxic to adjacent motor neurons.

In these and several other studies, researchers screened thousands of small organic molecules, including many approved as drugs for treatment of other unrelated diseases, for those that could reverse the abnormalities in the ALS iPS cell-derived motor neurons. Several were identified and are in clinical trials to see if they can slow or stop the devastating effects of ALS. In any case, these experiments illustrate the value of iPS and ES cells in generating cell culture models of many types of difficult-to-study human diseases that can be used to screen for drugs that could treat many as yet untreatable afflictions.

## ES and iPS Cells Can Generate Functional Differentiated Human Cells

Neurons and glial cells, as well as other cell types, derived from human iPS cells have been implanted into mice with some promising results. Stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells) can correct heart arrhythmias; certain glial cells-oligodendrocytes-show promise in aiding recovery from experimental spinal injury; and retinal epithelial cells can partially correct defects in mouse models of blindness.

One very recent advance-the generation of normal insulin-secreting $\beta$ islet cells from human iPS and ES cellsshows promise for treatment of both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes results from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic $\beta$ cells, whereas the more common type 2 diabetes results from insulin resistance in liver and muscle (see Figure 16-40), eventually leading to dysfunction and death of $\beta$ cells. Patients who receive transplants of human islets from cadavers can be made insulin independent for 5 years or longer, but this approach is limited because of the scarcity and quality of donor islets; thus the possibility of an unlimited supply of human $\beta$ cells from stem cells could potentially extend this therapy to millions of new patients.

One key to this successful generation of $\beta$ cells was employing successive treatment with different combinations of growth factors that stimulated iPS or ES cells to traverse the normal embryonic developmental sequence by which the progeny of undifferentiated ICM cells form $\beta$ cells (Figure 21-9a). The so-called SC- $\beta$ cells that resulted have a structure very similar to that of normal $\beta$ islet cells, including secretory granules filled with almost crystalline insulin (see Figure 14-23); they also secrete normal amounts of insulin in response to elevation of the glucose level in their culture medium. Shortly after their transplantation into mice, these cells secrete human insulin into the serum in a glucose-regulated manner. Most important, after transplantation of these cells into immunocompromised
diabetic mice, their high glucose levels are lowered to normal (Figure 21-9b), indicating the potential use of these islet cells-which can be produced in culture in essentially unlimited numbers-for the treatment of diabetes. Screening to identify new drugs that improve $\beta$ cell function, survival, or proliferation can also make use of such a uniform supply of stem cell-derived $\beta$ cells.

These SC- $\beta$ cells are assuredly a harbinger of what is to come. The coming years are certain to see the development of many other types of differentiated cells from human iPS cells that can be used as "replacement parts" for a variety of maladies. Many important questions must be answered, however, before the feasibility of using human ES or iPS cells for therapeutic purposes can be assessed adequately. For instance, when undifferentiated human or mouse ES or iPS cells are transplanted into an experimental mouse, they form teratomas, tumors that contains masses of partially differentiated cell types. Thus it is essential to ensure that all of the ES or iPS cells used to generate an implant have indeed undergone differentiation and have lost their pluripotency and their ability to induce teratomas or cause other problems.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 21.2

## Embryonic Stem Cells and Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells

- The inner cell mass is the source of the embryo proper as well as of embryonic stem cells.
- Cultured embryonic stem cells (ES cells) are pluripotent, capable of giving rise to all differentiated cell types of the organism with the exception of extraembryonic tissues. They are useful in the production of genetically altered mice and offer the potential for therapeutic uses.
- The pluripotency of ES cells is controlled by multiple factors, including the state of DNA methylation, chromatin regulators, certain micro-RNAs, and the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog.
- Animal cloning establishes that cell differentiation can be reversed.
- Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells can be formed from somatic cells by expression of combinations of key transcription factors, including KLF4, Sox2, Oct4, and Myc.
- As exemplified by ALS, differentiated cells produced in culture from human iPS cells can be used to understand the underlying cause of a disease as well as to screen drugs that could be used to treat the disease.
- $\beta$ islet cells produced in culture from human iPS cells secrete insulin normally in response to an elevation of glucose in the media and reverse the high glucose levels in diabetic mice.

FIGURE 21-9 Production of normal insulin-secreting $\beta$ islet cells from human iPS or ES cells. (a) Schematic of directed differentiation of human ES or iPS cells into insulin-secreting $\beta$ islet cells. Clusters of a few hundred human ES or iPS cells were sequentially cultured in media containing the indicated growth factors for the indicated number of days to first produce definitive endoderm cells, then a series of pancreatic progenitor cells, then pancreatic endocrine progenitors, and finally stem cell-derived insulin-producing $\beta$ islet cells (termed SC- $\beta$ cells).

(b) SC- $\beta$ cells can be used to treat diabetes in
mice. These experiments used a strain of diabetic mice with a mutation in the insulin gene as well as mutations in several immune-system genes such that the animals did not reject transplants of human tissue. Previous work had shown that the elevated glucose levels in these mice could be restored to normal by transplantation with human pancreatic islets. In this experiment, mice were transplanted with SC- $\beta$ cells (black circles) or a similar number of control pancreatic progenitor cells (white circles). At the start of the experiment, the average blood glucose level in these mice was about 11 mM , well above the normal 5 mM . The average blood glucose level in the control mice rose continuously to about 30 mM , indicating severe diabetes, while in the mice transplanted with the human SC- $\beta$ cells, blood glucose dropped to nearly the normal 5 mM .

### 21.3 Stem Cells and Niches in Multicellular Organisms

Many differentiated cell types are sloughed from the body or have life spans that are shorter than that of the organism. Disease and trauma can also lead to losses of differentiated cells. Since most types of differentiated cells do not divide, they must be replenished from nearby somatic stem-cell populations. In vertebrates and most invertebrates, such stem cells, in contrast to pluripotent ES cells, are multipotent in that they can give rise to some, but not all, of the cell types found in the organism. Postnatal (adult) vertebrate animals
contain stem cells for many tissues, including the blood, intestine, skin, ovaries, testes, and muscle. Even some parts of the adult brain, where little cell division normally occurs, have a population of stem cells (see Chapter 22). In striated muscle, stem cells are most important in healing, as relatively little cell division occurs at other times. Some other cell types, such as liver cells (hepatocytes) and insulin-producing $\beta$ islet cells, reproduce mainly by division of already differentiated cells, as exemplified by regeneration of the liver when large pieces are surgically removed. Whether these tissues also contain stem cells that can generate these types of differentiated cells is controversial.

## Adult Planaria Contain Pluripotent Stem Cells

We noted in Chapter 1 that small body segments of planaria can regenerate whole animals. Regeneration was known to require a population of proliferating stem cell-like cells, termed neoblasts, that are present throughout the adult body, but a key question was whether regeneration is accomplished, as in most animals with this capability, by the collective activity of multiple lineage-restricted stem or progenitor cells, or whether pluripotent stem cells are involved. Recent experiments showed that adult planaria contain lineage-restricted neoblasts as well as pluripotent stem cells, termed cNeoblasts.

The key studies used gamma-irradiation to inhibit most or all cell division in adult planaria; the treated animals could not regenerate and suffered massive tissue loss because of failed replacement of aged differentiated cells. The few functional proliferating neoblast cells remaining after irradiation could be identified by a marker gene termed smedwi-1. Several days after irradiation, individual neoblasts formed colonies of smedwi-1-positive cells that contained multiple types of differentiated body cells (see the chapter-opening figure), and it was hypothesized that this smedwi-1-positive subpopulation of neoblasts was pluripotent. To test this hypothesis, single neoblasts were transplanted into lethally irradiated planaria that lacked all of their own neoblasts. Remarkably, several transplant recipients lived past 7 weeks and regenerated, from the single transplanted cell, neuronal, intestinal, and other differentiated cell types that were distributed throughout the body. These animals eventually regained feeding behavior and had regenerated complex tissues, including photoreceptors. These experiments indicated that at least some of the neoblast stem cells in adult planaria are indeed pluripotent, providing a cellular basis for the remarkable regenerative abilities of planaria. Despite much effort, no pluripotent stem cells have ever been reliably identified in any adult vertebrate organism.

## Multipotent Somatic Stem Cells Give Rise to Both Stem Cells and Differentiating Cells

The most common type of stem cells in adult metazoans, multipotent somatic stem cells, give rise to the specialized cells composing body tissues. Multipotent somatic stem cells have three key properties (Figure 21-10):

1. They can give rise to multiple types of differentiated cells; that is, they are multipotent. In this sense, they are different from progenitor cells (also called precursor cells), which generally give rise to only a single type of differentiated cell. A stem cell has the capability of generating a number of different cell types, but not all cell types; that is, it is not pluripotent like an ES cell. For instance, a multipotent blood stem cell will form more of itself plus multiple types of blood cells, but never a skin or a liver cell.
2. They are stem cells in that they are undifferentiated; in general, they do not express proteins characteristic of the differentiated cell types formed by their descendants.
3. The number of stem cells of a particular type generally increases during embryonic development and then remains relatively constant over the remainder of an individual's lifetime. In that sense, stem cells are often said to be immortal, although no single stem cell survives for the life of the animal. Indeed, when pushed to divide more frequently than normal by chronic tissue injury, repeated rounds of chemotherapy, or genetic defects that impair genomic integrity, stem cells consistently exhibit a finite replicative capacity.

The two critical properties of stem cells that together distinguish them from all other cells are the ability to reproduce themselves during many cell divisions (self-renewal) and the ability to generate progeny of more restricted potential. Many types of stem cells in the adult body divide infrequently; they are kept "in reserve" in case certain types of differentiated cells are required. In contrast, their non-stem-cell daughters frequently undergo many rapid rounds of cell division. Such cells, often called transient amplifying cells (see Figure 21-10), can have limited self-renewal capabilities, but eventually their many progeny form lineage-restricted progenitor cells. These cells, in turn, can divide and generate very specific types of terminally differentiated cells.

Stem cells can exhibit several patterns of cell division. Some types of stem cells always divide asymmetrically to generate one copy of the parent cell and one daughter stem cell that has more restricted capabilities, such as dividing for a limited time or giving rise to fewer types of progeny than the parent stem cell (Figure 21-11a). This type of stem-cell division is commonly found in invertebrates such as Drosophila, discussed below.

Other patterns of stem-cell division, commonly found in vertebrates, allow the number of stem cells or differentiated cells to increase or decrease according to the needs of the animal (Figure 21-11b, c). Hormones released by adjacent cells frequently regulate these patterns of stem-cell division. For example, a stem cell may divide symmetrically to yield two daughters that undergo different fates: depending on external signals sent by other cells, one may remain a stem cell and the other may generate differentiated progeny. As we will see in greater detail shortly, this happens in the small intestine: often one of the daughters remains a stem cell identical to its parent while the other daughter divides rapidly and generates four types of differentiated intestinal cells. Other stem-cell divisions are symmetric, producing two stem cells and increasing the number of stem cells of a particular type; this pattern of stem-cell division is common during development. Thus mitotic divisions of stem cells can either enlarge the population of stem cells or maintain a stem-cell population while steadily producing a stream of differentiating cells.

## Stem Cells for Different Tissues Occupy Sustaining Niches

Stem cells need the right microenvironment to remain multipotent and to regulate the timing and pattern of their divisions. In addition to intrinsic regulatory signals-such

![li7035345559](li7035345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-10 The pathway from stem cells to lineagerestricted progenitors to differentiated cells. On average, during each division of a multipotent somatic stem cell, at least one of the daughter cells becomes a stem cell like the parent cell. Stem cells thus undergo self-renewal divisions such that the number of stem cells of a particular type stays constant or increases during the organism's lifetime. Other daughter cells, termed transient amplifying cells, divide rapidly and undergo limited numbers of self-renewal divisions, but ultimately produce lineage-restricted progenitor cells. These cells cannot undergo self-renewal divisions, but can divide and produce differentiated cells of a particular type.

(b) Increase stem cells

FIGURE 21-11 Patterns of stem-cell differentiation. Different patterns of stem-cell division produce different proportions of stem cells (red) and differentiating cells (green). Stem-cell divisions must meet three objectives: they must maintain the stem-cell population, they must sometimes increase the number of stem cells, and at the right time, they must produce cells that go on to differentiate. (a) Stem cells can undergo asymmetric divisions, producing one stem cell and one differentiating cell. This pattern does not increase the population of stem cells. (b) Some stem cells can divide symmetrically to increase their population, which may be useful in normal development or during recovery from injury, at the same time that others in the same population can be dividing asymmetrically as in (a). (c) Some stem cells may divide as in (b) while at the same time other stem cells produce two differentiating progeny. See S. J. Morrison and J. Kimble, 2006, Nature 441:1068-1074.
as the presence of certain transcription factors and other regulatory proteins-stem cells rely on extrinsic hormonal and other regulatory signals from surrounding cells to maintain their status as stem cells. The location where a stem-cell fate can be maintained is called a stem-cell niche, by analogy to an ecological niche-a location that supports the existence and competitive advantage of a particular organism. The right combination of intrinsic and extrinsic regulation, imparted by a niche, will create and sustain a population of stem cells.

In order to investigate or use stem cells, we must find them and characterize them. It is often difficult to identify stem cells precisely; they are very rare among cells and generally lack distinctive shapes. Most stem cells divide rarely, if at all, until stimulated by signals that convey the need for new cells. For example, inadequate oxygen supplies can stimulate blood stem cells to divide, and injury to the skin can stimulate regenerative cell division starting with the activation of stem cells. Some stem cells, including those that form the continuously shed epithelium of the intestine, are continuously dividing, usually at a slow rate. In the rest of this section, we focus on four types of stem cells in plants and animals that are well characterized; in the coming years, other types of stem cells will also be understood in great detail.

## Germ-Line Stem Cells Produce Sperm or Oocytes

The germ line is the cell lineage that produces oocytes and sperm. It is distinct from the somatic cells that make all the other tissues but are not passed on to progeny. The germ line, like somatic-cell lineages, starts with stem cells, but these cells are unipotent in that they make only germ cells. Stem-cell niches have been especially well defined in studies of germ-line stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila and C. elegans. Germ-line stem cells are present in adult flies and worms, and the locations of these stem cells are well known.

In the fly, the niche where oocyte precursors form and begin to differentiate is located next to the tip of the germarium, the part of the ovary where eggs are formed (Figure 21-12a). There are two or three germ-line stem cells in this location next to a few cap cells, which create the niche by secreting two proteins in the TGF- $\beta$ family, Dpp and Gbb, as well as Hedgehog (Hh) protein (Figure 21-12b). (These secreted protein signals were introduced in Chapter 16.) The cap cells create the niche because the TGF- $\beta$-class signals they send repress transcription of a key differentiation factor, the Bag of marbles (Bam) protein, in the neighboring germ-line stem cells. Repression of the bam gene allows germ-line stem cells to undergo self-renewing divisions, whereas activation of bam promotes differentiation. When a germ-line stem cell divides, one of the resulting daughters remains adjacent to the cap cells and is therefore maintained as a stem cell, like the parent cell. The other daughter is too far from the cap cells to receive the cap-cell-derived signals Dpp and Gbb. As a result, Bam expression turns on, causing that daughter cell to enter the differentiation program. The signals involved were identified in part through the power of Drosophila genetics: mutant germ-line stem cells with defects in their Dpp or Gbb receptors, or their downstream signal transduction proteins, are lost prematurely. Conversely, overexpression of Dpp by cap cells prevents differentiation of germ-line stem cells and causes formation of tumorlike cell masses.

The stem cells are held in the niche by the transmembrane cell-surface protein E-cadherin (see Chapter 20), which forms adherens junctions via homotypic interactions with similar E-cadherin molecules on the cap cell. These adherens junctions orient the mitotic spindle of the germline stem cells such that one daughter remains attached to the cap cell and the other is displaced from the niche; similar asymmetric stem-cell divisions occur during other developmental stages in Drosophila, as we discuss later (see Figures 21-30 and 21-31 below). Armadillo (Arm), the fly $\beta$-catenin, connects the cytoplasmic tails of the E-cadherin molecules to the actin cytoskeleton; like E-cadherin, Arm is important in maintaining the stem-cell niche.

Separate somatic stem cells in the germarium produce follicle cells that will make the eggshell. The somatic stem cells have a niche too, created by the inner sheath cells, which produce Wingless (Wg) protein—a fly Wnt signaland Hh protein (Figure 21-12c). Hedgehog produced by the cap cells may also play a role. Thus two different populations of stem cells can work in close coordination to produce different parts of an egg.

Binding of these ligands to receptors on the surface of a germline stem cell-the TGF- $\beta$ receptors I and II and Ptc, respectivelyresults in repression of the bam gene by two transcription factors, Mad and Med. Repression of bam allows germ-line stem cells to self-renew, whereas activation of bam promotes differentiation. The transmembrane cell-adhesion protein E-cadherin forms the homotypic adherens junctions between germ-line stem cells and cap cells. Arm (Armadillo), the fly $\beta$-catenin, connects the cytoplasmic tails of the E-cadherin to the actin cytoskeleton; both E-cadherin and Arm are important in maintaining the stem-cell niche. (c) Signaling pathways that control the properties of somatic stem cells. The Wnt signal Wingless (Wg) is produced by the inner sheath cells and is received by the Frizzled receptor (Fz) on a somatic stem cell. Hh is similarly produced and is received by the Ptc receptor. Both of these signals result in self-renewal of somatic stem cells. See L. Li and T. Xie, 2005, Annu. Rev. Cell Devel. Biol. 21:605 and T. Xie, 2013, WIREs Dev. Biol. 2:261.

The identification and characterization of Drosophila germ-line stem cells, as well as similar cells from C. elegans, were important because they convincingly demonstrated the existence of stem-cell niches and permitted experiments to

identify the niche-made signals that cause cells to become and remain self-renewing stem cells. Thus a stem-cell niche is a set of cells and the signals they produce, not just a location.

## Intestinal Stem Cells Continuously Generate All the Cells of the Intestinal Epithelium

The epithelium lining the small intestine is a single cell thick (see Figure 20-11) and is composed of four types of differentiated cells. The most abundant epithelial cells, the absorptive

FIGURE 21-13 Intestinal stem cells and their niche. (a) Schematic drawing of an intestinal crypt and villus, showing the Lgr5-expressing (Lgr5 ${ }^{+}$) intestinal stem cells (dark green), their mitotic progeny, the transient amplifying cells (intermediate blue), the terminal differentiating cells (light blue), and the several types of differentiated cells in the villus. The base of the crypt is the location of Paneth cells (yellow), which provide a major part of the stem-cell niche and also secrete
enterocytes, transport nutrients essential for survival from the intestinal lumen into the body (see Figure 11-30). The intestinal epithelium is the most rapidly self-renewing tissue in adult mammals, turning over every 5 days; in humans, up to $300,000,000$ intestinal epithelial cells, weighing a total of about 1 gram, are lost every day.

The cells of the intestinal epithelium are continuously regenerated from a stem-cell population located deep in the intestinal wall in pits called crypts (Figure 21-13). Pulsechase experiments using radiolabeled thymidine have shown
![li7535345559](li7535345559.jpg)
antimicrobial defense proteins. The $+4$ "reserve" stem cells (which occupy the fourth position from the crypt base, dark blue) can restore the Lgr5 ${ }^{+}$stem-cell compartment following injury and can also be generated from these stem cells. (b) Lineages of cells in the small intestine. Epithelial turnover occurs every 3-5 days. New Paneth cells are supplied from the transient amplifying cells every 3-6 weeks. See N. Barker, 2014, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 15:19.

that intestinal stem cells produce precursor cells that divide rapidly and then differentiate as they ascend the sides of crypts to form the surface layer of the fingerlike gut projections called villi, across which intestinal absorption occurs. The time from cell birth in the crypts to the loss of dead cells at the tips of the villi is only about 3 to 5 days (Figure 21-14). The production of new cells is precisely controlled: too little division would eliminate villi and lead to breakdown of the intestinal surface; too much division would create an excessively large epithelium and might also be a step toward cancer.

Experiments such as the one depicted in Figure 21-14 suggested that the intestinal stem cells were located somewhere near the bottom of the crypts, near differentiated intestinal cells called Paneth cells. But these putative stem cells had no particular morphological characteristics that revealed their remarkable abilities; which cells were the actual intestinal stem cells and which were the supportive cells that form the niche?

Prior genetic experiments had shown that Wnt signals are essential for intestinal stem-cell maintenance. As evidence for the importance of these signals, overproduction of active $\beta$-catenin (normally activated by the Wnt signaling pathway; see Figure 16-30) in intestinal cells leads to excess proliferation of the intestinal epithelium. Conversely, blocking the function of $\beta$-catenin by mutating or inhibiting the Wnt-activated TCF transcription factor abolishes the stem cells in the intestine, leading to intestinal degeneration and eventual death. Thus Wnt signaling plays a critical role in the intestinal stem-cell niche, as it does in the skin, blood, and other organs. Indeed, mutations that inappropriately activate the Wnt signaling pathway are a major contributor to the progression of colon cancer, as we will see in Chapter 24.

By analyzing a panel of genes whose expression in the intestine was induced by Wnt signaling, investigators zeroed in on Lgr5, a gene encoding a G protein-coupled receptor, because it was expressed only in a small set of cells at the very base of the crypts. Lgr5 binds a class of secreted hormones termed R-spondins and activates intracellular signaling
![li7635345559](li7635345559.jpg)
pathways that potentiate Wnt signaling. Lineage-tracing studies showed that the descendants of these Lgr5-expressing cells indeed gave rise to all of the differentiated intestinal epithelial cells (Figure 21-15). These studies made use of genetically altered mice in which a version of the Cre recombination protein (see Figure 6-39), an estrogen receptor (ER)-Cre recombinase chimera, was placed under the control of the Lgr5 promoter; thus the ER-Cre recombinase chimera was produced only in the few putative Lgr5-expressing stem cells at the bottom of the crypts. The version of Cre recombinase used in the study had been altered so that it resides inactive in the cytosol and is transferred into the nucleus only after addition of an estrogen analog (Figure 21-15a). There the Cre excises a segment of DNA, activating expression of a $\beta$-galactosidase reporter gene. Importantly, all of the descendants of these cells will also express $\beta$-galactosidase. Immediately after addition of the estrogen analog, the only cells expressing $\beta$-galactosidase are the stem cells in the crypts. But after a few days, all of the descendant epithelial cells also expressed $\beta$-galactosidase (Figure 21-15b), showing that Lgr5 expression is indeed a marker of the intestinal stem cells.

In subsequent studies, single Lgr5-expressing stem cells were isolated from intestinal crypts and cultured on an extracellular matrix (see Figure 20-23) containing type IV collagen and laminin, similar to the matrix that normally underlies and supports the intestinal epithelia. These cells generated villus-like structures that contained all four differentiated cell types found in the mature intestinal epithelium (Figure 21-16). Taken together, these experiments established that expression of the Lgr5 gene defines the intestinal stem cells and showed that these cells are localized at the bases of the intestinal crypts interspersed between the terminally differentiated Paneth cells (see Figure 21-13). Lgr5expressing cells are also found in the stomach, colon, and pancreas-which, like the small intestine, are formed from the embryonic endoderm-and are thought to be the stem cells for these tissues. Indeed, culturing Lgr5-expressing cells from these tissues in the presence of Wnt, R-spondin, and

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-14 Regeneration of the intestinal epithelium from stem cells can be demonstrated in pulse-chase experiments. Results from a pulse-chase experiment in which radioactively labeled thymidine (the pulse) was added to a culture of intestinal epithelial tissue. Dividing cells incorporated the labeled thymidine into their newly synthesized DNA. The labeled thymidine was washed away and replaced with unlabeled thymidine (the chase) after a brief period; cells that divided after the chase did not become labeled. These micrographs show that 40 minutes after labeling, all of the label is in cells near the base of the crypt. At later times, the labeled cells are seen progressively farther away from their point of birth in the crypt. Cells at the top are shed. This process ensures constant replenishment of the gut epithelium with new cells. [Republished with permission of John Wiley \& Sons, Inc., from Kaur, P. and Potten, C.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-15 Lineage-tracing studies show that the Lgr5-expressing cells at the bases of crypts are the intestinal stem cells. (a) Outline of the experiment. Using genetically altered ES cells (see Figure 6-37), investigators generated one strain of mice in which a version of the gene encoding Cre recombinase (see Figure 6-39) was placed under the control of the Lgr5 promoter, and thus Cre recombinase was produced only in cells, such as intestinal stem cells, that express the Lgr5 gene. This version of Cre recombinase contained an additional domain from the estrogen receptor (ER) that binds the estrogen analog tamoxifen; like the estrogen receptor and other nuclear receptors (see Figure 9-45), the ER-Cre chimera is retained in the cytosol unless tamoxifen is added. In the presence of tamoxifen, ER-Cre moves into the nucleus, where it can interact with loxP sites in the chromosomal DNA. A second reporter strain of mice contained a bacterial $\beta$-galactosidase reporter gene that was preceded by two loxP sites. The blocking segment of DNA in between these loxP sites prevented expression of the $\beta$-galactosidase gene, and the $\beta$-galactosidase gene could be expressed only in
cells where an active Cre recombinase had removed the sequence in between the two loxP sites. The two strains of mice were mated, and offspring containing both marker transgenes were identified. In these mice, $\beta$-galactosidase was expressed only in cells in which the Lgr5-controlled ER-Cre gene was expressed, and only after the estrogen analog tamoxifen was given to the mice. Thus only Lgr5-expressing cells-and all of their descendants-would express the $\beta$-galactosidase gene. (b) Results of the experiment. One day after tamoxifen was given to these mice, the only cells expressing $\beta$-galactosidase (indicated by the blue histochemical stain) were the Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells at the bases of the crypts (left). Five days after tamoxifen administration, additional blue cells-the epithelial descendants of the intestinal stem cells-were seen migrating up the sides of the villi. Some blue stem cells remained at the bottom of the crypt.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-16 Single Lgr5-expressing intestinal stem cells build crypt-villus structures in culture without niche cells. Single Lgr5-expressing cells isolated from intestinal crypts were placed in culture on a type IV extracellular matrix (see Figure 20-23), the type of matrix that normally underlies and supports sheets of epithelial cells. After 2 weeks, these cultures had formed epithelial sheets that resembled villi in structure. Staining of these organoids for specific marker proteins showed that they contained all four differentiated epithelial cell types: (a) villin (green) is a marker protein for the absorptive enterocytes that are localized near the apical (luminal, Lu) surface of these organoids; (b) Muc2 (red) for goblet cells; (c) lysozyme (green) for Paneth cells; and (d) chromogranin A (green) for enteroendocrine cells. The organoids were also stained with DAPI (blue) to reveal nuclei.

other hormones generates mini-organoids that contain differentiated cells characteristic of these tissues.

Paneth cells are longer-lived than the cells of the villi; they produce several antibacterial proteins, including the enzyme lysozyme, which degrades bacterial cell walls and thus protects the intestine from infections. Surprising recent evidence suggests that Paneth cells also constitute a major part of the niche for the intestinal stem cells. Cultured Paneth cells produce Wnt as well as other hormones, such as EGF and a Delta protein (see Chapter 16), that are essential for intestinal stem-cell maintenance. Co-culturing of intestinal stem cells with Paneth cells markedly improved the formation of intestinal villus-like structures, and genetic manipulations in mice that caused a reduction of Paneth cell numbers concomitantly caused a reduction in intestinal stem cells. Thus Paneth cells-which are progeny cells of the intestinal stem cells-constitute much, if not all, of the niche for intestinal stem-cell maintenance.

The Lgr5-expressing cells may not be the only type of intestinal stem cells. Evidence indicates that so-called +4 cells located in the crypts (see Figure 21-13a) may be "reserve stem cells" that can generate Lgr5-expressing stem cells following intestinal injury, such as by irradiation. In turn, these +4 cells can be generated from Lgr5-expressing stem cells (see Figure 21-13b). Recall that transient amplifying cells have limited self-renewal potential (see Figure 21-10). During periods of intestinal injury, when many Lgr5-expressing stem cells are lost, some of the transient amplifying cells, under the influence of Wnt signals, can "dedifferentiate" and revert to Lgr5-expressing stem cells and relocalize to the Paneth-cell niche! Thus the conversion of differentiated cells into stem
cells, as seen experimentally during formation of iPS cells, may occur normally in the body during periods of stress or injury. Thus, rather than relying on a single stem cell-to-differentiated cell lineage (see Figure 21-13b), the intestine seems capable of drawing on several pools of reserve stem-cell populations. Future work will undoubtedly clarify the role of these cells in generation of intestinal epithelial cells.

## Hematopoietic Stem Cells Form All Blood Cells

Another continuously replenished tissue is the blood, whose stem cells are located in the embryonic liver and in bone marrow in adult animals. The various types of blood cells all derive from a single type of multipotent, self-renewing hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). An HSC gives rise to two other multipotent cell types, common myeloid and common lymphoid progenitor cells, which are more restricted in their fates but are capable of limited self-renewal (Figure 21-17). Numerous extracellular growth factors called cytokines regulate HSC self-renewal divisions as well as proliferation and differentiation of the precursor cells for various blood-cell lineages. Each branch of the blood-cell lineage tree has different cytokine regulators, allowing exquisite control of the production of specific cell types. If all blood-cell types are needed-for example, after a bleeding injury-multiple cytokines can be produced. If only one cell type is needed, specific signals control its production. For example, when a person is traveling at high altitude, erythropoietin is made by the kidney and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of CFU-E (erythroid progenitor) cells, but not other types of blood-cell precursors. Erythropoietin activates several different intracellular signal transduction pathways, leading to changes in gene expression that promote formation of erythrocytes (see Figures 16-7 and 16-8). Similarly, G-CSF, a different cytokine, stimulates proliferation of bipotential granulocyte-macrophage progenitors and their differentiation into granulocytes, while M-CSF stimulates production of macrophages from the same progenitor cell type.

Hematopoietic stem cells were originally detected and quantified by bone marrow transplantation experiments in mice whose hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells had been wiped out by irradiation (Figure 21-18). By transplanting specific types of hematopoietic precursors into these mice and observing which blood cells were restored, researchers could infer which precursors or terminally differentiated cells (e.g., erythrocytes, monocytes) arise from a particular type of precursor. The first step was separation of the different types of precursors. This sorting was possible because HSCs and each type of precursor produce unique combinations of cell-surface proteins that can serve as cell type-specific markers. If bone marrow extracts are treated with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies for these markers, cells with different markers can be separated in a fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS; see Figures 4-2 and 4-3). Remarkably, such transplantation experiments revealed that a single HSC is sufficient to restore the entire blood system when transferred into a lethally irradiated

FIGURE 21-17 Formation of blood cells from hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow. Multipotent hematopoietic stem cells may divide symmetrically to increase the numbers of stem cells. In adults, they generally divide asymmetrically to form one daughter cell that is multipotent, like the parent stem cell, and another daughter cell with a more restricted fate. Ultimately, this daughter cell generates either common lymphoid progenitors or common myeloid progenitors; although these multipotent cells are capable of limited self-renewal, they are committed to one of the two major hematopoietic lineages. Depending on the types and amounts of cytokines present, the
common lymphoid and common myeloid progenitors undergo rapid rounds of cell division and generate different types of progenitor cells (light green). These progenitors are either multipotent or unipotent in that they can give rise to several types or only a single type of differentiated blood cells, respectively; they respond to one or a few specific cytokines. Some of the cytokines that support this process are indicated (pink labels). CSF = colony-stimulating factor; $\mathrm{IL}=$ interleukin; $\mathrm{SCF}=$ stem-cell factor; Epo $=$ erythropoietin; $\mathrm{Tpo}=$ thrombopoietin. See M. Socolovsky et al., 1998, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 95:6573, and N. Noverstern et al., 2011, Cell 144:296.
mouse in which all of the HSCs have been killed. After transplantation, the HSC takes up residence in a niche in the bone marrow and divides to make more HSCs as well as progenitors of the different blood-cell lineages.

The first successful human bone marrow transplant was done in 1959, when a patient with end-stage (fatal) leukemia was irradiated to destroy her cancer cells as well as her own normal HSCs. She was transfused with bone marrow cells from her identical twin sister, thus avoiding an immune response, and was in remission for 3 months. This pioneering effort, which was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1990, led to the present-day treatments that can often lead to a complete cure of many cancers. The stem cells in the transplanted marrow can generate all types of functional blood cells, so transplants are useful in patients with certain hereditary blood diseases, including many genetic anemias (insufficient red-cell levels) or genetic defects of
blood cells, such as sickle-cell disease (a hemoglobin disorder), as well as in cancer patients who have received irradiation or chemotherapy, both of which destroy the bone marrow cells as well as cancer cells.

During embryonic life, HSCs often divide symmetrically, producing two daughter stem cells (see Figure 21-11); this process allows the number of stem cells to increase over time and produce the large number of progenitor cells required to make all of the necessary blood cells before birth. In adult animals, HSCs are largely quiescent, "resting" in the $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ state in the bone marrow stem-cell niche. When more blood cells are needed, cytokines are generated that signal HSCs to divide, producing stem cells like the parent cells and rapidly proliferating transient amplifying cells that generate the progenitors illustrated in Figure 21-17. Whether individual HSCs undergo symmetric or asymmetric division is not known.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-18 Functional analysis of hematopoietic stem cells by bone marrow transplantation. The two strains of mice used in this analysis are genetically identical except for the gene encoding a protein, termed Ly5, found on the surfaces of all nucleated blood cells, including all $T$ and $B$ lymphocytes, granulocytes, and monocytes. The proteins encoded by the two alleles of the gene, Ly5.1 and Ly5.2, can be detected by specific monoclonal antibodies. A recipient Ly5.2 mouse is lethally irradiated to kill all HSCs, then injected with stem cells purified from a Ly5.1 strain. Because the stem cells take weeks or months to produce differentiated blood cells, the recipient mouse will die unless it receives bone marrow progenitor cells from a genetically identical mouse (termed "supportive" cells) that will produce mature blood cells for the first few weeks after the transplant. At intervals after the transplant, blood or bone marrow is recovered and reacted with a blue-fluorescing monoclonal antibody to Ly5.1 and a red-fluorescing monoclonal antibody to Ly5.2. Mature blood cells that are descended from the donor stem cell are detected by FACS analysis, seen here as cells that fluoresce blue and not red. These cells can be sorted and stained with fluorescent antibodies specific for marker proteins found on different types of mature blood cells to show that a stem cell is indeed pluripotent, in that it can generate all types of lymphoid and myeloid cells.

## Rare Types of Cells Constitute the Niche for Hematopoietic Stem Cells

Like all stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells are found in niches. During late embryonic development, HSCs are found in the fetal liver, and in adults, most are localized to the bone marrow. But identifying HSCs and the cells that make up the HSC niche was very complicated. The frequency of HSCs is about 1 per $10^{4}$ bone marrow or fetal liver cells.

Furthermore, identifying HSCs by any technique other than transplantation assays was difficult because no cell-surface protein is expressed only by HSCs, and thus no marker was available for these cells. Much work showed that HSCs could be prospectively identified and purified because they express a cell-surface protein called CD150 (of unknown function) and do not express any of the dozen or so "Lin" (Lineage-restricted) proteins characteristic of other types of hematopoietic progenitor and differentiated cells.

Efforts to identify the niche cells took advantage of the fact that HSCs require a growth factor termed stem cell factor (SCF) for their survival; this protein, which is bound to the surface of an adjacent signaling cell, activates the c-Kit protein tyrosine kinase receptor on HSCs. HSCs also require the secreted protein thrombopoietin, which activates a thrombopoietin receptor that is similar in structure and function to the erythropoietin receptor, and CXCL12, which binds to a G protein-coupled receptor and is required to keep HSCs in the niche. In the fetal liver, only the progenitor cells that generate hepatocytes, the major cell type in the liver, express these three proteins as well as others required for HSC survival. Co-culture of these hepatic progenitor cells with HSCs led to expansion of HSC numbers as well as formation of their differentiated progeny. Thus hepatocyte progenitors were found to be the major cell that forms the HSC niche in the fetal liver.

In adults, a small number of mesenchymal cells surround the small blood vessels, termed sinusoids, that permeate the bone marrow. These cells, called stromal cells, express SCF as well as the receptor for the cytokine leptin on their surface. They also synthesize abundant CXCL12 and are thought to be the major HSC niche cells in the bone marrow (Figure 21-19a). Immunofluorescence analysis showed that about 85 percent of HSCs physically contact these stromal cells (Figure 21-19b). Other cells in the bone marrow probably influence stem-cell maintenance or niche function by releasing other types of hormones.

You have probably noticed that all the molecular regulators of stem cells that we have discussed are familiar proteins (see Chapters 15 and 16) rather than dedicated regulators that specialize in stem-cell control. Each type of signal is used repeatedly to control cell fates and growth. Stem cells are regulated by ancient signaling systems, at least a half billion years old, for which new uses have emerged as cells, tissues, organs, and animals have evolved new variations.

## Meristems Are Niches for Stem Cells in Plants

In plants, as in their multicellular animal counterparts, the production of all tissues and organs relies on small populations of stem cells. Like animal stem cells, these stem cells are defined by their ability to undergo selfrenewal and to generate daughter cells that produce differentiated tissues. And like animal stem cells, plant stem cells reside in specialized microenvironments-stem-cell nicheswhere extracellular signals are produced that maintain the

![li8135345559](li8135345559.jpg)
stem cells in a multipotent state. Because the last common ancestor of plants and animals was a unicellular eukaryote, it would appear that, despite common organizing principles, stem cells and their niches evolved independently and by different pathways in plants and animals-an example of convergent evolution.

The niches in which plant stem cells are located, called meristems, can persist for thousands of years in long-lived species such as bristlecone pines. The body axis of the plant

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-19 The hematopoietic stem-cell niche in the bone marrow. (a) The bone marrow contains dozens of different types of cells, including osteoblasts and osteoclasts that build and degrade bone, respectively, as well as multiple types of hematopoietic cells, fibroblasts, and other cell types. The bone marrow is permeated by small blood vessels termed sinusoids. The predominant cells that form the HSC niche are the very rare mesenchymal stromal cells that adhere to these vessels and that express a combination of cell-surface proteins including SCF, the hormone that binds to and activates the c-Kit protein tyrosine kinase receptor on HSCs. These stromal cells also express the receptor for the cytokine leptin and secrete CXCL12, a chemoattractant for HSCs. See S. Morrison and D. Scadden, 2014, Nature 505:327. (b-d) Immunofluorescence detection of HSCs and niche cells in bone marrow, showing that HSCs are localized next to SCF-expressing cells. Antibodies to SCF were not available, so in order to detect SCF expression, a mouse was generated in which GFP cDNA was placed in the SCF gene locus and expressed only in cells that normally produce SCF. Bone marrow sections were then examined in a fluorescence microscope to detect the SCF-expressing cells (b). To detect HSCs, the sections were stained with an antibody to the CD150 protein, expressed in HSCs (c). The sections were also stained with a collection of antibodies (d) specific for proteins expressed by different types of differentiated blood cells, but not by HSCs. (e) When the three images are merged, the HSC (white arrows) can be seen lying adjacent to the SCF-expressing stromal cell.

is defined by two primary meristems that are established during embryogenesis, the shoot apical meristem and the root apical meristem. In contrast to animal development, very few tissues or organs are specified during plant embryogenesis. Instead, organs such as leaves, flowers, and even germ cells are continuously generated as the plant grows and develops. The aboveground part of the plant is derived from the shoot apical meristem and the belowground part from the root apical meristem. Classic clonal analysis experiments

have demonstrated that plant cell fate depends on the cell's position, not its lineage. A cell's identity is reinforced by intercellular signals such as hormones, mobile signaling peptides, and miRNAs.

Unlike somatic stem cells in metazoan animals, somatic plant stem cells give rise to entire organs, not just specific tissues or lineages. Slowly dividing pluripotent stem cells are located at the apex of the shoot apical meristem, with more rapidly dividing multipotent transient amplifying daughter cells on the periphery. Descendants of the shoot stem cells are displaced to the periphery of the meristem and are recruited to form primordia of new organs, including leaves and stems. Division ceases as these cells acquire the characteristics of specific cell types, and most organ growth occurs by cell expansion and elongation (Figure 21-20a). New shoot stem-cell niches can form in the axils of leaf primordia, which then grow to form lateral branches. Floral meristems give rise to the four floral organs-sepals, stamens, carpels, and petals-that form flowers. Unlike shoot apical meristems, floral meristems gradually become depleted as they give rise to the floral organs.

## A Negative Feedback Loop Maintains the Size of the Shoot Apical Stem-Cell Population

Genes required for stem-cell identity, maintenance, and cell differentiation have been defined by genetic screens in the mustard-family weed Arabidopsis thaliana
(see Figure 1-22h) for mutants exhibiting larger, smaller, or non-replenishing meristems as well as by more recent geneexpression profiling studies of isolated meristem-cell populations. One shoot apical meristem determinant is the gene called WUSCHEL (WUS), which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor (see Chapter 9). WUS is required for maintenance of the stem-cell population but is expressed in the supportive cells underlying the stem cells. These cells, collectively termed the organizing center, are analogous to the niche cells in metazoans (see Figure 21-20a). While WUS mRNA and protein is synthesized in the cells of the organizing center, a series of experiments showed that WUS moves from the organizing-center cells into the stem cells, presumably through the interconnecting plasmodesmata (see Figure 20-41). In one study, a WUS-GFP fusion protein, when expressed in WUS-negative Arabidopsis plants, was able to rescue the mutant phenotype. Subsequent microscopic analysis showed that this WUS-GFP chimera accumulated in the stem cells, indicating it had moved there from the organizingcenter cells.

Once in the stem cells, WUS binds to many sites in the genome; it represses a large number of genes that are expressed in differentiating cells, including a group of differentiation-promoting transcription factors required for leaf development. WUS also directly activates the expression of CLAVATA3 (CLV3) in stem cells. CLV3 encodes a small secreted peptide that binds to the CLV1 receptor on the surface of organizing-center cells and generates an intracellular signal that negatively regulates WUS expression. Overexpression of WUS causes a large expansion of the

(b) Transverse section through the root meristem.
![li8335345559](li8335345559.jpg)

Stem cells surround the mitotically less active quiescent center, four cells that send signals to prevent stem-cell differentiation. Each stem cell divides asymmetrically: one daughter remains adjacent to the quiescent center and becomes a stem cell (self-renewal); the other daughter becomes a transient amplifying cell that divides a number of times before exiting the cell cycle, elongating, and assuming a specific differentiated state. See R. Heidstra and S. Sabatini, 2014, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:301.

meristem stem-cell population at the expense of production of differentiated cells. Thus the negative feedback loop between a transcription factor, WUS, and a signaling peptide, CLV3, maintains the size of the stem-cell population and the number of their dividing daughter cells over the lifetime of the plant (Figure 21-21).

Several other transcriptional regulatory proteins are essential for the normal function of both shoot and root meristem cells, including the plant homolog of the human retinoblastoma ( Rb ) tumor suppressor protein (see Chapter 24), called RBR. As in animal cells, RBR binds to and inhibits the function of an E2F transcription factor; release of RBR from E2F or genetic loss of RBR allows the E2F factor to promote transcription of multiple genes that promote entry into the cell cycle and cell division (see Figure 19-12b). Reduced levels of RBR result in an increase in stem-cell numbers, and increased RBR levels lead to stemcell differentiation; both of these observations indicate a prominent role for RBR in stem-cell maintenance.

Secreted CLV3 protein binds to CLV1, the CLV3 receptor protein kinase on the surface of organizing center cells; there, it activates a signal that represses WUS transcription. See E.

## The Root Meristem Resembles the Shoot Meristem in Structure and Function

$\square$Unlike the shoot meristem, the root meristem consists of lineage-restricted stem cells. These cells are organized around the quiescent center, four very slowly dividing cells that serve as the stem-cell niche (Figure 21-20b). Stemcell division is asymmetric (also unlike that in the shoot), and the daughter cell that loses contact with the quiescent center divides several more times and then differentiates. A WUS homolog, WOX5, is expressed in the quiescent center and is required for stem-cell maintenance, although other transcription factors are also important. The plant hormone auxin (indole-3-acetic acid) coordinates many processes involved in plant growth and differentiation; in particular, it is essential for formation of the root meristem niche. If the quiescent center is ablated, a new niche is formed in an area of high auxin concentration. However, the effect of auxin on stem cells depends on the specific cell type. For example, in the stem cells that give rise to the root cap, auxin promotes cell differentiation by repressing WOX5 via auxin-responsive transcription factors.

Plants have an amazing capacity for regeneration. The home gardener will be familiar with the ability of leaf or stem cuttings to form roots with little inducement beyond a glass of water and a sunny windowsill. Experiments performed in the mid-twentieth century demonstrated that single cells isolated from carrot roots could regenerate entire plants when placed on media containing the appropriate mix of nutrients and hormones. After that time, an often-cited major difference between plant and animal cells was that all plant cells are totipotent. Today, however, with our ability to generate iPS cells from differentiated animals cells as well as more recent careful analyses of the cells contributing to plant regeneration, which suggest that regenerated tissue arises from preexisting populations of stem cells rather than through a process of dedifferentiation, this distinction is becoming blurred.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 21.3

## Stem Cells and Niches in Multicellular Organisms

- Planaria contain pluripotent stem cells termed cNeoblasts that are important for regeneration of body parts removed by amputation.
- Most stem cells in animals are multipotent, except for germ-line stem cells that are unipotent.
- Stem cells are undifferentiated; they can undergo symmetric or asymmetric self-renewal divisions such that their number remains constant or increases over the organism's lifetime (see Figure 21-11).
- Stem cells are formed in niches that provide signals to maintain a population of undifferentiated stem cells.

The niche must maintain stem cells without allowing their excess proliferation and must block differentiation.

- Stem cells are prevented from differentiating by specific controls that operate in the niche. A high level of $\beta$-catenin, a component of the Wnt signaling pathway, has been implicated in preserving stem cells in the germ line and intestine by directing cells toward self-renewal division rather than differentiation states.
- In the Drosophila germarium, a few cells form the germ stem-cell niche, sending signals directly to the adjacent stem cells. Daughter cells that are displaced from the niche cells undergo proliferation and differentiation into germ cells (see Figure 21-12).
- Populations of stem cells associated with the intestinal epithelium and many other tissues regenerate differentiated tissue cells that are damaged, sloughed, or aged (see Figure 21-13).
- Intestinal stem cells reside in the bases of intestinal crypts, adjacent to Paneth cells, which form part of the niche, and are marked by expression of the Lgr5 receptor (see Figure 21-13).
- In the blood-cell lineage, different precursor types form and proliferate under the control of distinct cytokines (see Figure 21-17). This system allows the body to specifically induce the replenishment of some or all of the necessary blood-cell types.
- Hematopoietic stem cells can be detected and quantified by bone marrow transplant experiments (see Figure 21-18) and their niche cells detected using a combination of marker surface proteins (see Figure 21-19).
- Plant stem cells persist for the life of the plant in the meristem. Meristem cells can give rise to a broad spectrum of cell types and structures (see Figure 21-20).
- A negative feedback loop involving the WUS transcription factor maintains the size of the shoot apical stem-cell population.


### 21.4 Mechanisms of Cell Polarity and Asymmetric Cell Division

We have discussed the importance of asymmetric division in generating cell diversity during development and in maintaining the number of stem cells in a population. What mechanisms underlie the ability of cells to become asymmetric before cell division to give rise to cells with different fates? Cell asymmetry is a concept we have met before, under the name of cell polarity, so let us first review what it means for a cell to be polarized.

Cell polarity-the ability of cells to organize their internal structure, resulting in changes in cell shape and the generation of regions of the plasma membrane with different protein and lipid compositions-has been introduced in several chapters. For example, we have seen that
polarized intestinal epithelial cells have an apical domain with abundant microvilli separated from the basolateral domain by tight junctions (see Figures 17-1 and 20-11). Epithelial transport requires these cells to have different transport proteins in the apical and basolateral membranes (see Figure 11-30). As we will see later in this section, these epithelial cells are responding to extracellular signals that instruct them how to polarize. These cells represent just one example of cell polarity-essentially all cells in animals are polarized, and we discuss several examples in which the underlying mechanisms have been defined. What emerges are three core principles of cell polarity. First, cells have an intrinsic polarity program, as revealed by their remarkable ability to polarize in the absence of external cues. As we will see in our examples, a master and common regulator of this program is the small GTPase Cdc42. Second, this intrinsic polarity program can be directed by external or internal cues. Third, the polarity of individual cells is often maintained by intracellular mutually antagonistic complexes. We first discuss the intrinsic polarity program in budding yeast because, given that all the components of the mechanism are shared with animals, the principles uncovered in yeast are likely to be conserved. We then turn our discussion to examples in which cells respond to external cues to establish cell polarity depending on antagonistic interactions. Finally, we discuss an example of asymmetric cell division that gives rise to a daughter stem cell and a differentiated cell.

## The Intrinsic Polarity Program Depends on a Positive Feedback Loop Involving Cdc42

Budding yeast grows by selecting a single site on its surface at which to assemble a new bud (see Figure 19-3). Importantly, it must reliably select just one site. If a cell grew two buds simultaneously, consider what would happen during mitosis: the duplicated chromosomes might be segregated between the parent cell and one bud, leaving the other bud without chromosomes and therefore inviable. In haploid yeast, this so-called singularity of budding is guided by a signal, or cue, left at the cell surface, which directs the next budding event to a site adjacent to the former budding site. Remarkably, if the genes that specify the nonessential components of this cue are deleted, yeast cells grow just as well, but each assembles a single bud at a random site. This result reveals that yeast has an intrinsic polarity program that, even in the absence of cues from the previous budding cycle, can guide selection of a single site for bud growth. This program requires the concentration of Cdc42 at the site from which a bud will emerge.

Surprisingly, Cdc42 concentration at the site for a new bud does not depend on either actin filaments or microtubules, as this small GTPase localizes to a single spot even when both filament systems are disrupted (Figure 21-22a). Long before biologists had thought about how this might occur, the brilliant mathematician and computer pioneer Alan Turing considered what mechanism might shift a uniform distribution of a polarity factor to a concentration at a

![li8535345559](li8535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-22 The intrinsic polarity program of budding yeast involves a positive feedback loop for activation of the GTPase Cdc42. (a) Diploid yeast lacking polarity cues show polarized Cdc42, visualized here by immunofluorescence microscopy, when they are about to assemble a bud. The cells were treated with drugs to disassemble both actin filaments and microtubules to show that polarization of Cdc42 is not dependent on these cytoskeletal filaments. (b) Positive feedback loop for activation of Cdc42. Inactive Cdc42-GDP is in equilibrium between a cytosolic pool of complexes with the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) and a membrane-bound pool. Step 1 One of the membrane-associated Cdc42-GDP proteins may spontaneously become an activated Cdc42-GTP. Step 1 Active Cdc42-GTP recruits a complex containing the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). Step 1 The recruited GEF now locally converts more Cdc42-GDP to Cdc42-GTP. Step 1 This active Cdc42-GTP recruits more GEF, thus driving a positive feedback loop that results in the local accumulation of Cdc42-GTP. See C.-F. Wu and D. Lew, 2013, Trends Cell Biol. 23:476.

single site. In 1952, Turing suggested that such a shift could be achieved if a positive feedback reaction amplified a random increase in the concentration of the polarity factorand he was right!

Recall that Cdc42 is a member of the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins (see Figure 17-41). It acts as a molecular switch, existing in an inactive (Cdc42-GDP) and an active (Cdc42-GTP) state. Binding to its specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (Cdc42-GEF) causes Cdc42 to release GDP and bind GTP. The active Cdc42-GTP binds effectors and thereby activates downstream signaling events. In its inactive state, Cdc42-GDP exists in equilibrium between a cytosolic pool, which is bound to a guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), and a membrane-bound Cdc42-GDP pool (Figure 21-22b). Occasionally and randomly, the membrane-bound Cdc42-GDP will release
its GDP and bind GTP, which converts it to the active Cdc42-GTP state (Figure 21-22b, step 1). One of the effectors that is recruited to Cdc42-GTP is a protein complex that contains Cdc42-GEF (step 1). Thus, when an active Cdc42 arises in the plasma membrane, it recruits Cdc42-GEF, which locally activates more Cdc42, which recruits more Cdc42-GEF, and this simple positive feedback loop generates a site highly and locally enriched for Cdc42-GTP on the cell surface (steps $\mathbf{\square}$ and $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Computational modeling-also pioneered by Turing—shows that this system can result in a "winner-takes-all" scenario to yield just one site of polarization. This positive feedback loop is the core mechanism by which one very stable budding site is generated in yeast.

As we saw in Chapter 18, Cdc42 is also the master regulator that guides the polarization of migrating cells (see Figure 18-53), in which a similar type of feedback cycle also

probably exists. As we will see, Cdc42 is involved in regulating many additional examples of cell polarity. It is important to note that in cases in which polarization needs to be more flexible, negative feedback loops ensure that the single site of polarization is not too strong, so that it can be redirected to another site on the cell surface upon receiving appropriate signals. For example, in addition to its fast-acting GEF, Cdc42-GTP might also recruit a slow-acting negative regulator that modulates the degree of positive feedback. In fact, yeast Cdc42 recruits a kinase that phosphorylates and inhibits the recruited Cdc42-GEF, thereby introducing a negative feedback loop. Thus the local concentration of Cdc42-GTP builds up fast, then levels off or disappears as the slower

FIGURE 21-23 General features of cell polarity and asymmetric cell division. (a) General hierarchy of the steps in generating a polarized cell. To know in which orientation to polarize, cells must be exposed to a spatial cue (step (1). They must also have receptors or other mechanisms to sense the cue (step (2). Once a cell senses the cue, signal transduction pathways (step (1) regulate the cytoskeleton (microtubules and/or microfilaments, depending on the system) to reorganize it in the appropriate polarized manner (step (3). The polarized cytoskeleton provides the framework for the transport of membrane-trafficking organelles and macromolecular complexes, including fate and polarity determinants, in the cell (step (4). In many
negative regulator comes into play. The biochemical basis of these positive and negative feedback loops is an active and important area of current research. As we will see, specific cues normally guide these intrinsic polarity programs, which in turn lead to the physical polarization of the cell.

## Cell Polarization Before Cell Division Follows a Common Hierarchy of Steps

The polarization of a cell, with or without cell division, follows the general pattern diagrammed in Figure 21-23a. In order to know in which direction to polarize, or become asymmetric, a cell generally senses specific cues that provide
(b)
![li8835345559](li8835345559.jpg)
cases, the polarity is reinforced by the return of polarity determinants that have moved away from the site of concentration. In cases in which the determinants are membrane proteins, this reinforcement cycle may involve uptake by endocytosis and delivery to the site of concentration (step (5). (b) Cell polarity requires specific determinants, including mRNAs, proteins, and lipids, to be asymmetrically localized in a cell. If the mitotic spindle is positioned so that these determinants are segregated during cell division, the two daughter cells will have different cell fate determinants. However, if the mitotic spindle is not oriented appropriately, the determinants will not be segregated properly, and the daughter cells could have the same fate (not shown).

it with spatial information (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). As we will see, such cues can be soluble signals from other cells or from the extracellular matrix. To be receptive to these cues, a cell must have appropriate receptors or other machinery on its surface (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Once the cues have been detected, the cell responds by feeding the incoming signal into its polarity program to define the orientation of polarity (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Generally the next step involves the local reorganization of cytoskeletal elements, notably microfilaments and microtubules (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Once the cell has structural asymmetry, molecular motors direct the trafficking of polarity factors-which, depending on the system, may be cytoplasmic proteins or membrane proteins synthesized by the secretory pathway, or both-to their appropriate locations (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The polarity can often be reinforced or maintained by moving the polarity determinants from sites of lower concentration back to the polarization site to maintain the highest concentration there (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ).

If a cell becomes polarized and cell division then occurs in a plane perpendicular to the direction of polarization, the cell has undergone asymmetric cell division. In this way, fate determinants, such as specific proteins or mRNAs, can be differentially segregated between the cells (Figure 21-23b).

Cell polarization can be a very dynamic process. Consider a macrophage chasing a bacterium in order to catch and destroy it by phagocytosis: the macrophage must continually sense the bacterium, which it does by following a gradient of a peptide left by the bacterium (see Figure 17-46). This signal orients-or polarizes-the macrophage to move in the correct direction. This example highlights an important and common aspect of cell polarity: in many cases, it must be dynamic so that, as in the example of the macrophage, it can quickly change direction. Although we have illustrated the dynamics of cell polarity in terms of a macrophage, the polarity of epithelial and other cells that appear very static are probably quite dynamic when those cells are moved to different environments.

In the next section, we discuss a simple cell that shows asymmetry: a yeast cell responding to a soluble cue during mating. In later sections, we turn to animal cells, in which conserved polarity proteins are instrumental in interpreting polarity cues and generating cell asymmetry prior to cell division. We then describe how these same polarity proteins are used to polarize epithelial cells. Finally, we discuss aspects of asymmetric division in stem cells.

## Polarized Membrane Traffic Allows Yeast to Grow Asymmetrically During Mating

One of the simplest and best-studied forms of cell asymmetry occurs when budding yeast cells mate. As we have seen, yeast can exist in a haploid state (with a single copy of each chromosome) or a diploid state (with two copies of each chromosome). The haploid state can exist in either of two mating types ("sexes"), a or $\alpha$. The preferred state of yeast in nature is the diploid state, so a cells are always looking to mate with $\alpha$ cells to restore the diploid state (see

Figure 1-23). Each mating type secretes a specific mating pheromone-a cells secrete a factor and $\alpha$ cells secrete $\alpha$ factor-and each expresses on its surface a receptor that senses the pheromone of the opposite mating type. Thus a cells have a receptor for $\alpha$ factor and $\alpha$ cells have a receptor for a factor. When cells of opposite mating types are placed near each other, the receptors on each cell bind and detect the pheromone cue of the other cell and determine its spatially highest concentration in order to know in which direction to mate. When the cells detect the opposite mating factor, two important processes occur. First, they synchronize their cell cycles by arresting at $G_{0}$ so that when they mate, the two haploid genomes will be at the same stage of the cell cycle. Second, they target cell growth in the direction of the pheromone to assemble a mating projection called a shmoo. If shmooing cells of opposite mating types touch, they fuse at the shmoo tips, and the haploid nuclei come together to restore the diploid state.

By looking for mutants in yeast haploids that cannot shmoo in response to the opposite mating pheromone, researchers have discovered how the asymmetric growth necessary for shmoo formation occurs (Figure 21-24). As might be anticipated, this mechanism initially involves a signal transduction pathway that establishes a polarized cytoskeleton, which in turn guides membrane traffic to the appropriate location for asymmetric growth. Activation of the mating-factor receptor-a typical G proteincoupled receptor (see Figure 15-12)—results in activation of the intrinsic polarity program, which in turn results in the localized accumulation and activation of Cdc42 in the region of the cell cortex closest to the pheromone source (Figure 21-24, step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). This active Cdc42-GTP leads to the local activation of a formin protein (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). As we saw in Chapter 17, formin proteins nucleate the assembly of polarized actin filaments, whose ( + ) ends remain bound to the formin (see Figure 17-13). This process provides the tracks for the transport of secretory vesicles by a myosin V motor to the $(+)$ ends of the filaments for localized growth and hence shmoo formation (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Notice that this mechanism requires polarity proteins, which include Cdc42-GTP, to remain concentrated at the growing shmoo tip. To ensure that polarity is maintained during shmoo growth, a directed endocytic cycle is believed to exist. In this cycle, Cdc42 that has diffused away from the site of concentration may be internalized by endocytosis and transported back to the shmoo tip, thereby reinforcing polarity (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ).

## The Par Proteins Direct Cell Asymmetry in the Nematode Embryo

The nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans has provided a powerful model system for understanding cell fate decisions. It was selected for study because the animal is transparent and has a rapid life cycle; it is easy to generate and characterize mutants; and the lineage of cells from the one-cell embryo to the adult is invariant (Figure 21-25a, c, d). A critical

![li8935345559](li8935345559.jpg)
aspect of this lineage is the first cell division, in which the P0 cell-the fertilized egg, or zygote-gives rise to the AB and P 1 cells by an asymmetric cell division; each of these two cells then gives rise to different lineages. Much is known about this first asymmetric division, which is where we focus our attention.

Before the first cell division, the zygote is visibly asymmetric: cytoplasmic complexes called P granules are concentrated at the cell end that will give rise to the posterior end of the embryo (Figure 21-25b). It turns out that during further cell divisions, these P granules always segregate to cells that will give rise to the germ line, where they ultimately play an important role in germ-line development. The first asymmetric division of the P0 cell gives rise to the P 1 cell, containing the P granules, and the larger $A B$ cell. Following that, at the two-cell stage, the mitotic spindles

FIGURE 21-24 Mechanism of shmoo formation in yeast.
(a) The haploid yeast cell must grow toward the highest concentration of mating factor of the opposite mating type, so it has a receptor on its surface that signals the location of the highest concentration. This signal induces the localization and activation of Cdc42 to generate a higher concentration of Cdc42-GTP at this site (step (1). The Cdc42-GTP locally activates a formin, which nucleates and elongates actin filaments from this site (step (2). Because formins bind to the ( + ) ends of actin filaments, the ( + ) ends are oriented toward Cdc42-GTP and thus the highest concentration of the mating factor. A myosin V motor transports secretory vesicles along the actin filaments, resulting in the growth of the shmoo (step (3). The polarity of the shmoo is reinforced by an endocytic cycle that constantly returns diffusing polarity factors, such as Cdc42, back along the actin filaments to the signal site (step (4).

are arranged at right angles to one another so that the ensuing cell divisions are also at right angles to one another (Figure 21-26a). To begin to understand how this first essential asymmetric division occurs, mutations in six different genes were identified that resulted in a symmetric first division. Since the P granules were not partitioned correctly in these mutants, the genes identified in this study were called partition defective, or par, genes. In these mutants, P granules did not properly localize to the posterior end of the zygote, and the mitotic spindles were not oriented correctly in preparation for the second division (see Figure 21-26a). A key insight came when the products of the par genes were localized. In wild-type zygotes, many of the Par proteins localize either at the cortex of the anterior half of the cell or at the cortex of the posterior half. For example, Par3 (as part of a larger complex comprising Cdc42, Par3, Par6, and aPKC—atypical protein kinase C) localizes anteriorly, while Par2 and Par1 localize posteriorly (Figure 21-26b). Subsequent work has shown that mutually antagonistic interactions exist between these protein complexes; that is, if the Cdc42-Par3-Par6-aPKC complex is localized to one region, it excludes Par2, and vice versa. This is shown by the finding that the Par3-Par6-aPKC complex spreads over the whole cortex in par2 mutants and Par2 spreads over the whole cortex in par3 or par6 mutants. The molecular nature of this antagonism is not fully understood, but part of it is mediated by the protein kinase aPKC, which phosphorylates Par2 to inhibit its ability to bind to the anterior cortex.

Zygote
![li9235345559](li9235345559.jpg)

The unfertilized egg is symmetric, so what breaks this symmetry to generate a polarized zygote? It turns out that the position of the sperm after fertilization determines the posterior end. Prior to sperm entry, the entire egg cortex is under tension provided by an actin meshwork containing active myosin II. As we saw in Chapter 17, myosin II can
form bipolar filaments that pull on actin filaments to generate tension, as is also seen in muscle and the contractile ring. Myosin II activity is regulated by a signal transduction pathway involving the small GTPase Rho (see Figure 17-43). In the unfertilized egg, Rho is maintained in its active Rho$\cdot$GTP state by the uniform distribution of its activator,

Notice that in wild-type cells, the AB cell is larger than the P 1 cell, whereas they are the same size in the par3 mutant. The par3 mutant also has a defect in spindle
the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rho-GEF. Rho-GTP activates Rho kinase, which phosphorylates the myosin light chain of myosin II to activate it (Figure 21-27a). Shortly after fertilization, an unknown signal from the sperm centrosome

results in the local depletion of the Rho-GEF that is necessary to maintain active Rho. Thus the asymmetric position of the sperm centrosome defines the posterior region by depleting the Rho-GEF, thereby lowering the activity of myosin II. With this local reduction in contractile activity, the actin-myosin network contracts toward the anterior (Figure 21-27b), and as it does so, it drags (in an unknown manner) the anterior complex containing Par3, Par6, and aPKC to that end (Figure 21-27c). With the removal of the anterior complex, Par2 can now occupy the posterior cortex, and cell asymmetry is established.

It turns out that the master regulator Cdc42 is not needed for the initial asymmetry induced by actin-myosin network contraction. However, active Cdc42-GTP binds Par6 and is necessary for maintaining the anterior complex at the anterior end, although the mechanism for this localization is not yet clear. Recent work has also implicated an endocytic reinforcement cycle, as we discussed for yeast shmoo formation, to maintain polarity. Thus the steps of responding to a spatial cue, establishing asymmetry, and maintaining asymmetry are conserved features of both systems.

(a) Before fertilization, the cell cortex is under tension due to the activity of Rho-GEF, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the small GTPase Rho.

(b) Localization of myosin II before (top) and after (bottom) fertilization. The asterisk marks the region of sperm entry. (c) Before fertilization, Rho-GEF is uniformly active, the cortex is under tension from active myosin II, and the anterior Par complex (Cdc42-Par3-Par6-aPKC) is uniformly distributed around the cortex. Upon fertilization, Rho-GEF becomes locally reduced, resulting in local deactivation of myo$\sin$ II. This deactivation generates unequal tension, so the actin-myosin network contracts toward the future anterior end, moving the anterior Par complex with it. Once the anterior complex is localized, factors such as Par2 associate with the posterior cell cortex. See D. St. Johnston and J. Ahringer, 2010, Cell 141:757.

## The Par Proteins and Other Polarity Complexes Are Involved in Epithelial-Cell Polarity

In vertebrates, polarized epithelial cells use cues from adjacent cells and the extracellular matrix to orient their axis of polarization. The process of polarization in epithelial cells of vertebrates is quite similar to that in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Much of our knowledge has come from the fly system because of the ease with which mutants can be isolated and analyzed.

Genetic screens in the fly have uncovered multiple genes necessary for the generation of epithelial-cell polarity. Analyses of the proteins encoded by these genes and of the phenotypes of mutants have identified three major groups of proteins: the complex made up of Cdc42, Par3, Par6, and aPKC (in this system known as the apical Par complex, or simply as the Par complex), the Crumbs complex, and the Scribble complex. By extensive analyses of the effects of these complexes on one another when individual components are missing, a general understanding of their contributions to epithelial-cell polarization has been achieved, although a detailed molecular understanding is still emerging (Figure 21-28a).

The first known step in epithelial-cell polarization is interaction between adjacent cells, which in vertebrate cells occurs through nectin, a cell-adhesion molecule in the Ig superfamily, and a junctional protein called JAM-A. These interactions signal the cells to recruit the Par complex and to assemble adherens and tight junctions (see Figure 20-1). The Crumbs complex is recruited more apically than the Par
complex, and the Scribble complex defines the basolateral surface. In the absence of the Par complex, cells cannot polarize, and as in the nematode embryo, the Par complex is the master regulator of cell polarity. In the absence of the Scribble complex, the apical domain is greatly expanded, whereas in the absence of Crumbs, the apical domain is greatly reduced. These observations have led to the realization that there are mutually antagonistic relationships between these complexes, in which, for example, the apical Par complex kinase aPKC antagonizes the basolateral Scribble complex by phosphorylation (see Figure 21-28a). Thus, as is the case in the nematode embryo, asymmetry is mediated by complexes working antagonistically against each other.

In a manner that is only partially understood, this arrangement of polarity proteins reorganizes the cytoskeleton so that distinct arrangements of microfilaments become associated with the apical and basolateral membranes. The distribution of microtubules in epithelial cells is rather unusual, as they do not all associate with a centrosome; instead, lateral microtubules orient their (-) ends toward the apical domain and other microtubules run perpendicular to the lateral microtubules below the microvilli and also along the base of the cell (Figure 21-28b); how these arrangements are established is not known. Membrane traffic is also polarized (Figure 21-28c). Newly made membrane proteins destined for the apical and basolateral membranes are sorted and packaged into distinct transport vesicles at the trans-Golgi network and then transported to the appropriate surface. In addition, endocytic pathways from both the apical and basolateral surfaces regulate the abundance of

FIGURE 21-28 Establishment of polarity in epithelial cells.
(a) Polarity determination in epithelial cells, like that in the nematode embryo, is driven by an apical Par complex. The formation of a cell-cell adhesion complex induces the recruitment of the Par complex. Then, intricate and antagonistic interactions of the Par complex with both the basolateral Scribble complex and the apical Crumbs complex lead to the establishment and maintenance of epithelial-cell polarity. The localization of the different complexes to membrane domains is indicated by colored bars: the Scribble complex associates with the
lateral membrane, the Par complex associates with the region at the cell junctions, and the Crumbs complex is immediately apical to the Par complex. Functional epithelial polarity is maintained by both (b) a polarized cytoskeleton and (c) membrane trafficking pathways. In the biosynthetic pathway, proteins and lipids destined for the apical and basolateral domains are sorted in the Golgi complex and transported to their respective surfaces (red arrows). Endocytic pathways (blue arrows) regulate the abundances of proteins and lipids on each surface and sort them between surfaces by transcytosis.

membrane proteins and transport missorted proteins using a complex set of sorting endosomes in a process known as transcytosis.

In genetic screens for additional components important for epithelial-cell polarity in the fly, components of endocytic trafficking were found. For example, one such mutant affects the trafficking of the apical transmembrane protein Crumbs, so that when endocytosis is compromised, the level of Crumbs on the surface goes up and the apical domain expands. Thus epithelial-cell polarity involves responses to spatial cues and reorganization of the cytoskeleton that provides a framework for both secretory and endocytic membrane traffic pathways for establishment and maintenance of the polarized state.

## The Planar Cell Polarity Pathway Orients Cells Within an Epithelium

We have so far discussed asymmetry in only one dimension, but in many cases cells in multicellular organisms are polarized in at least two dimensions-top to bottom and along a body axis. Just looking at features of the animals around us, such as the scales of fish, the feathers of birds, or the hairs on your arm, makes it clear that the groups of cells that give rise to these structures must be organized not only in a top-to-bottom (apical/basal) manner, but also in a head-to-tail, or proximal/distal, manner. This type of polarity is called planar cell polarity (PCP). A well-studied example from the fly is the single hair that points backward on each cell of the wing (Figure 21-29a). As we have seen, the fly is a model system that is particularly amenable to genetic dissection. Genetic analysis has shown that each wing cell responds to the planar direction of its neighbor, and components that specifically affect PCP have been identified (Figure 21-29b). The overall planar polarity of an epithelium is probably determined by a gradient of some ligand or of mechanical tension across the tissue. This gradient polarizes all the cells in the epithelium in the same manner, causing proteins encoded by the Frizzled and Dishevelled genes to localize on one side of each cell and the protein encoded by Strabismus on the other (Figure 21-29c). This asymmetric distribution of PCP proteins leads to the growth of the hair with the appropriate orientation. We have met Frizzled as a transmembrane receptor and Dishevelled as an adapter protein in the context of the Wnt pathway (see Figure 16-30), and their role in planar cell polarity may involve a form of Wnt and some other ligand. When components of the PCP pathway are disrupted-for example, in a Dishevelled mutant-the epithelium is perfectly intact, but the hairs are misoriented (see Figure 21-29b).

The complementary arrangement of PCP components means that the membrane protein Strabismus on the side of one cell will be adjacent to the Frizzled protein on the adjacent cell; indeed, these two proteins interact, and this interaction is important in coordinating PCP across an epithelium. Like the polarity complexes in nematodes and flies, these proteins show intracellular mutual antagonism
(Figure 21-29c). Thus when Frizzled on one cell binds to Strabismus on the adjacent cell, that adjacent cell will enrich Frizzled on its opposite side, where it will associate with Strabismus on the next cell, and this pattern will repeat across the tissue. Thus complementary interactions between Frizzled and Strabismus between cells and their mutual antagonism within a cell propagate PCP across a whole tissue.

Another clear example of planar cell polarity is the sensory hair cells of the inner ear that allow vertebrates to perceive sounds. Each of these cells has an ordered array of stereocilia arranged in a V-shaped pattern, and each cell is oriented precisely like its neighbor. In a mouse with a defect in the PCP gene Celsr1, the orderly arrangement of stereocilia within any given cell is preserved, but the relative orientations of cells to one another are disrupted (Figure 21-29d). These types of defects can result in deafness.

## The Par Proteins Are Involved in Asymmetric Division of Stem Cells

We have seen that stem cells often give rise to a daughter stem cell and a differentiated daughter cell (see Figure 21-11). What are the cues that set up these asymmetric cell divisions? Two types of mechanisms have been found (Figure 21-30). In one mechanism, cell fate determinants are segregated to one end of the cell before cell division in response to external cues. This mechanism involves the Par proteins, which, as we have already seen, are instrumental in the first asymmetric division of the nematode embryo and in establishing epithelial-cell polarity. In the second mechanism, the stem cell divides with a reproducible orientation so that it remains associated with the stem-cell niche, whereas the daughter cell is displaced away from the niche and can then differentiate. This is the situation we have already encountered in the Drosophila ovary, where the cap cells form a niche for the germ-line stem cells (see Figure 21-12).

A particularly well-understood example of the asymmetric division of stem cells is the formation of neurons and glial cells in the central nervous system of the fly (Figure 21-31). In this model system, a neuroblast stem cell arises from the neurogenic ectoderm, which is a typical epithelial layer with apical and basal surfaces. The neuroblast enlarges (step $\mathbf{1}$ ) and moves basally into the interior of the embryo, but remains in contact with the neurogenic ectoderm epithelium (step $\mathbf{1 0}$ ). It then divides asymmetrically (step $\mathbf{1}$ ) to give rise to a new neuroblast and a ganglion mother cell (step $\mathbf{1 0}$ ). The ganglion mother cell can divide only once, giving rise to two cells, either neurons or glial cells. The neuroblast, which remains a stem cell by maintaining an association with the neurogenic ectoderm niche, can divide repeatedly, giving rise to many ganglion mother cells and hence neurons and glial cells (step $\mathbf{1 1}$ ), and thus populates the central nervous system. Thus the key event is the ability of the neuroblast to divide asymmetrically (Figure 21-31b). Once again, this process involves the asymmetric accumulation of the Par complex-Par3-Par6-aPKC-and its positioning at the apical side of the

## EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-29 Planar-cell polarity (PCP)

determines the orientation of cells. (a) The hairs on each cell of the fly wing all point in the same direction in a wild-type fly. (b) In a fly defective in PCP, as shown in this Dishevelled mutant, the orientation of the hairs becomes disorganized, although the cells in the epithelium are still well organized. (c) The directionality of the hair is determined by the asymmetric localization of components of the PCP pathway, as indicated for Frizzled, Dishevelled, and Strabismus, all of which are needed for orienting the hair appropriately. Planar cell polarity is propagated across a tissue due to two mechanisms. First, Frizzled on one cell binds to Strabismus on the adjacent cell. Second, within each cell, the distribution of Frizzled and Strabismus is mutually exclusive due to their antagonism. (d) The sensory hair cells of the vertebrate
inner ear have V-shaped arrangements of stereocilia on their surface. In the adult and 18.5-day embryo (top and center images), all the cells are oriented in precisely the same way. In a mouse Celsr1 mutant (the vertebrate homolog of Flamingo) defective in PCP, the cells in the 18.5-day embryo appear normal, but their relative orientations are disrupted (arrows in bottom panel).

Other polarity-determining factors are then positioned at the basal side of the cell, and the mitotic spindle is set up so that cell division segregates these factors. One of these basally localized determinants, called Miranda, is a protein that associates with factors that control proliferation and differentiation (see Figure 21-31c). Thus, in the asymmetric cell division, Miranda and its associated factors are segregated away from the neuroblast and into the ganglion mother cell.

The GMC then divides once to give two neurons or glial cells (step 1). Meanwhile, the neuroblast can divide many times to produce more GMCs and so populates the neural tissue.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 21.4

## Mechanisms of Cell Polarity and Asymmetric Cell Division

- Cell polarity involves the asymmetric distribution of proteins, lipids, and other macromolecules in the cell.
- Cells have an intrinsic program that can generate polarity using feedback loops.

- A key regulator of the polarity program in many systems is the small GTP-binding protein Cdc42.
- When a yeast cell buds, the intrinsic polarity program exploits feedback loops to concentrate Cdc42-GTP at a single site.
- Asymmetry requires cells to sense a cue, respond to it by assembling a polarized cytoskeleton, and then using this polarity to distribute polarity factors appropriately.
- Mating in haploid yeast involves assembly of a mating projection (shmoo) by polarization of the cytoskeleton in the direction of highest concentration of mating pheromone and targeting of secretion of cellular components for cell expansion there.
- Anterior/posterior asymmetry in the first division of the C. elegans embryo involves asymmetric contraction of the actin-myosin network to localize the anterior Par3-Par6aPKC complex to the anterior cortex followed by the association of posterior factors such as Par2 with the posterior cortex. The asymmetry of the anterior and posterior complexes is maintained by mutually antagonistic pathways.
- Apical/basal epithelial-cell polarity is also driven by an apical Par3-Par6-aPKC complex, which functions in antagonistic relationships with the apical Crumbs complex and the basal Scribble complex.
- Planar cell polarity regulates the orientation of epithelial cells in a sheet using a different set of antagonistic relationships.
- Asymmetric cell division requires that cells first become polarized, then divide so as to segregate fate determinants asymmetrically.
- Asymmetric division of stem cells often involves association of the stem cell with a niche, in which case the stem cell gives rise to another stem cell and a differentiating cell.
- Asymmetric stem-cell division also involves the asymmetric distribution of the Par complex, which is retained in the stem cell during division, whereas fate determinants are localized away from the Par complex to end up in the differentiating cell.


### 21.5 Cell Death and Its Regulation

Regulated cell death is a counterintuitive, but essential, process in metazoan organisms. During embryogenesis, the programmed death of specific cells keeps chicken feet as well as our hands from being webbed (Figure 21-32); it also prevents our embryonic tails from persisting and our brains from being filled with useless nerve connections. In fact, the majority of cells generated during brain development subsequently die. We will see in Chapter 23 how immune-system cells that react to normal body proteins or produce nonfunctional antibodies are selectively killed. Many kinds of muscle, epithelial, and white blood cells constantly wear out and need to be removed and replaced.
![li10435345559](li10435345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-32 A web-footed chicken.
During the development of many vertebrate limbs, cells in the soft tissue between the embryonic digits undergo programmed cell death. In the chicken foot, this process leads to the formation of four separate toes (left). During chicken foot development, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (members of the TGF- $\beta$ superfamily of hormones; see Figure 16-3) are expressed by interdigital cells and induce apoptosis. In this experiment, a dominant-negative type I BMP receptor was expressed in a developing chicken foot, blocking BMP signaling and preventing the programmed cell death that normally occurs. This manipulation allowed the survival of cells that then divided and differentiated into a web (right). The similarity of this webbing to webbed duck feet led to studies showing that BMPs are not expressed in duck interdigital cells. These results indicate that BMP signaling actively mediates cell death in the embryonic limb.

Cell-cell interactions regulate cell death in two fundamentally different ways. First, most, if not all, cells in multicellular organisms require specific protein hormone signals to stay alive. In the absence of such survival signals, frequently referred to as trophic factors, cells activate a "suicide" program. Second, in some developmental contexts, including the immune system, other specific hormone signals induce a "murder" program that kills cells. Whether cells commit suicide for lack of survival signals or are murdered by killing signals from other cells, cell death is most often mediated by a common molecular pathway, termed apoptosis, that is largely conserved in invertebrates and vertebrates. The cell corpses are ingested by neighboring calls, and their contents are broken down into small molecules and reused to build other cells.

A different form of cell death, necrosis, occurs when cells are subjected to injury or excessive stresses such as heat, absence of oxygen, or infection by pathogens. Necrosis creates holes in the plasma membrane, causing leakage of intracellular contents. Perhaps surprisingly, one form of necrosis, termed necroptosis, is often triggered by extracellular hormones such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF $\alpha$; see Figure 16-35). Activation of this cell-death pathway

frequently causes inflammation and contributes to the development of many human diseases, including nerve degeneration and atherosclerosis.

In this section, we first distinguish programmed cell death from death due to necrosis and then describe how genetic studies in the nematode worm C. elegans led to the elucidation of an evolutionarily conserved effector pathway that leads to cell suicide. We then turn to vertebrates, in which cell death is regulated both by trophic factors, as exemplified by their importance in programmed cell death in neuronal development, and by cell stresses such as DNA damage. We illustrate the key roles of mitochondria in initiating vertebrate cell-death pathways. Finally, we discuss necroptosis and how our understanding of this process has paved the way for treating certain human diseases.

## Most Programmed Cell Death Occurs Through Apoptosis

The demise of cells by programmed cell death is marked by a well-defined sequence of morphological changes, collectively
referred to as apoptosis, a Greek word that means "dropping off" or "falling off," like leaves from a tree. Dying cells shrink, condense, and then fragment, releasing small membrane-bound apoptotic bodies, which are then engulfed by other cells (Figure 21-33). Within these apoptotic cells, nuclei condense, and the DNA is fragmented. Importantly, the intracellular constituents are not released into the extracellular milieu, where they would probably have deleterious effects on neighboring cells, but instead are phagocytosed by neighboring cells. The stereotypical changes that occur during apoptosis, such as condensation of the nucleus and phagocytosis by surrounding cells, suggested to early scientists that this type of cell death was under the control of a strict program. This program is critical during both embryonic and adult life to maintain normal cell number and composition.

The genes involved in controlling cell death encode proteins with three distinct functions:

- "Killer" proteins are required for a cell to begin the apoptotic process.
![li10535345559](li10535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-33 Ultrastructural features of cell death by apoptosis. (a) Schematic drawings illustrating the progression of morphological changes observed in apoptotic cells. Early in apoptosis, dense chromosome condensation occurs along the nuclear periphery. The cell body also shrinks, although most organelles remain intact. Later, both the nucleus and the cytoplasm fragment, forming apoptotic bodies, which are phagocytosed by surrounding cells. (b) Photomicrographs comparing a normal cell and an apoptotic cell. Clearly visible in the latter are dense spheres of compacted chromatin as the nucleus begins to fragment. (Part (b) from Piva, T. J. et al., "Increased activity of cell surface peptidases in HeLa cells undergoing UV-induced apoptosis is not mediated by Caspase 3," Int. J. Mol. Sci., 2012, 13(3):2650-2675, photo courtesy of Terrence Piva.)

- "Destruction" proteins perform functions such as digesting proteins and DNA in a dying cell.
- "Engulfment" proteins are required for phagocytosis of the dying cell by another cell.

At first glance, engulfment seems to be simply an after-death cleanup process, but evidence indicates that it is part of the final death process. For example, mutations in killer genes always prevent cells from initiating apoptosis, whereas mutations that block engulfment genes sometimes allow cells to persist for a while before dying. Engulfment involves the assembly of a halo of actin in the engulfing cell around the dying cell, triggered by activation of Rac, a monomeric G protein that helps regulate actin polymerization (see Figure 17-44).

In contrast to apoptosis, cells that die by necrosis or necroptosis exhibit very different morphological changes. Typically, cells that undergo this process swell and burst, releasing their intracellular contents, which can damage surrounding cells and frequently cause inflammation.

## Evolutionarily Conserved Proteins Participate in the Apoptotic Pathway

The confluence of genetic studies in C. elegans and studies on human cancer cells suggested that an evolutionarily conserved pathway mediates apoptosis. In C. elegans, cell lineages are under tight genetic control and are identical in all individuals of the species. About 10 rounds of cell division or fewer create the adult worm, which is about 1 mm long and $70 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. The adult worm may be a hermaphrodite (a worm with both male and female organs) or
(a)
![li10635345559](li10635345559.jpg)
(b)
![li10735345559](li10735345559.jpg)
a male. The hermaphrodite form has 959 somatic-cell nuclei, whereas the male has 1031 (see Figure 21-25d). Scientists have traced the lineage of each somatic cell in C. elegans from the fertilized egg to the mature worm by following the development of live worms using DIC microscopy (see Figure 21-25c).

Of the 947 nongonadal cells generated during development of the adult hermaphrodite form, 131 undergo programmed cell death. Specific mutations have revealed four genes whose encoded proteins play an essential role in controlling programmed cell death during C. elegans development: ced-3, ced-4, ced-9, and egl-1. In ced-3 or ced-4 mutants, for example, the 131 "doomed" cells survive (Figure 21-34). These mutants formed the first pieces of evidence that apoptosis was under a genetic program and led to a Nobel Prize for Robert Horvitz. The mammalian proteins that correspond most closely to the worm CED-3, CED-4, CED-9, and EGL-1 proteins are indicated in Figure 21-35. In discussing the worm proteins, we will occasionally include the mammalian names in parentheses to make it easier to keep the relationships clear.

The first mammalian apoptotic gene to be cloned, bcl-2, was isolated from human follicular lymphomas, tumors of the antibody-producing B cells of the immune system. A mutant form of this gene was formed in a patient's lymphoma cells; a chromosomal rearrangement joined the proteincoding region of the bcl-2 gene to an immunoglobulin-gene enhancer. The combination results in overproduction of the Bcl-2 protein, which keeps these cancer cells alive when they would otherwise become programmed to die. The human Bcl-2 protein and worm CED-9 protein are homologous; even though the two proteins are only 23 percent identical in sequence, expression of a bcl-2 transgene can block the extensive cell death observed in ced-9 mutant worms. Thus both proteins act as regulators that suppress the apoptotic pathway (see Figure 21-35). In addition, both proteins contain a single transmembrane domain and are localized mainly to the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they serve as sensors that control the apoptotic pathway in response to external stimuli. As we discuss next, other regulators promote apoptosis.

In the worm apoptotic pathway, CED-3 (caspase-9 in mammals) is a protease required to destroy cell components during apoptosis. CED-4 (Apaf-1) is a protease-activating

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-34 Mutations in the ced-3 gene block programmed cell death in C. elegans. (a) Newly hatched mutant larva carrying a mutation in the ced-1 gene. Because mutations in this gene prevent engulfment of dead cells, highly refractile (and thus easily visualized) dead cells accumulate (arrows). (b) Newly hatched larva with mutations in both the ced-1 and ced-3 genes. The absence of refractile dead cells in these double mutants indicates that no cell deaths occurred. Thus the CED-3 protein is required for programmed cell death. [Republished with permission of Elsevier, from Ellis, H. M. and Horvitz, H. R., "Genetic control of programmed cell death in the nematode C. elegans," Cell, 1986, 44(6):817-829; permission conveyed through Copyright Clearance Center, Inc.]

![li10835345559](li10835345559.jpg)
factor that causes autoproteolytic cleavage of (and by) the inactive precursor of CED-3 (a zymogen), creating an active CED-3 protease that initiates cell death (see Figures 21-35 and 21-36). Cell death does not occur in ced-3 and ced-4 single mutants or in ced-9/ced-3 double mutants. In contrast, in ced-9 mutants, all cells die by apoptosis during embryonic life, so the adult form never develops. These genetic studies indicate that CED-3 and CED-4 are killer proteins required for cell death, and that CED-9 (Bcl-2) suppresses apoptosis. The observation that all cells die in ced-9 mutants shows that the apoptotic pathway is present in and can be activated in all body cells. Moreover, the absence of cell death in ced-9/ ced-3 double mutants suggests that CED-9 acts upstream of CED-3 to suppress the apoptotic pathway.

The mechanism by which CED-9 (Bcl-2) controls CED-3 (caspase-9) in the nematode is known and is somewhat different from the mechanism, discussed later (see Figure 21-41 below), in mammalian cells. The nematode CED-9 protein forms a complex with a dimer of the CED-4 (Apaf-1) protein, thereby preventing the activation of CED-3 by CED-4 (Figure 21-36). As a result, the cell survives. This mechanism fits with the genetics, which shows that the absence of CED-9 has no effect if CED-3 is also missing (ced-3/ced-9 double mutants have no cell death). The three-dimensional structure of the trimeric CED-4/CED-9 complex reveals a

FIGURE 21-35 Evolutionary conservation of apoptosis pathways. Similar proteins, shown in identical colors, play corresponding roles in nematodes and in mammals. (a) In nematodes, the BH3only protein called EGL-1 binds to CED-9 on the outer mitochondrial membrane; this interaction releases CED-4 from the CED-4/CED-9 complex. Free CED-4 then binds to, and activates by autoproteolytic cleavage, the caspase CED-3, which destroys cell proteins to drive apoptosis. These relationships are shown as a genetic pathway, with EGL-1 inhibiting CED-9, which in turn inhibits CED-4. Active CED-4 activates CED-3. (b) In mammals, homologs of the nematode proteins, as well as many other proteins not found in the nematode, regulate apoptosis. The Bcl-2 protein is similar to CED-9 in promoting cell survival. It does so in part by preventing activation of Apaf-1, which is similar to CED-4, and in part by other mechanisms depicted in Figure 21-40. Several types of BH3-only proteins, detailed in Figures 21-39 and 21-40, inhibit Bcl-2 and thus allow apoptosis to proceed. Many apoptotic stimuli lead to damage of the outer mitochondrial membrane, causing release into the cytosol of several proteins that stimulate apoptosis. In particular, cytochrome c released from mitochondria activates Apaf-1, which in turn activates caspase-9. This initiator caspase then activates effector caspases-3 and -7, eventually leading to apoptosis. See text for discussion of other mammalian proteins (SMAC/DIABLO and XIAP) that have no nematode homologs. See S. J. Riedl and Y. Shi, 2004, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 5:897.
huge contact surface between each of the two CED-4 molecules and the single CED-9 molecule; the large contact surface makes the association highly specific, but in such a way that the dissociation of the complex can be regulated.

Transcription of egl-1, the fourth genetically defined apoptosis regulator gene, is stimulated in C. elegans cells that are programmed to die. Newly produced EGL-1 protein binds to CED-9, alters its conformation, and catalyzes the release of CED-4 from CED-9 (see Figure 21-36). Both EGL-1 and CED-9 contain a 12-amino-acid BH3 domain. Because EGL-1 lacks most of the other domains of CED-9, it is called a BH3-only protein. The mammalian BH3-only proteins closest in sequence and function to EGL-1 are the pro-apoptotic proteins Bid and Bim, discussed later.

Insight into how EGL-1 disrupts the CED-4/CED-9 complex comes from the molecular structure of EGL-1 (mammalian Bid/Bim) complexed with CED-9 (Bcl-2). In this complex, the BH3 domain forms the key part of the contact surface between the two proteins. CED-9 has a different conformation when bound by EGL-1 than when bound by CED-4. This finding suggests that EGL-1 binding distorts CED-9, making its interaction with CED-4 less stable. Once EGL-1 causes dissociation of the CED-4/CED-9 complex, the released CED-4 dimer joins with three other CED-4 dimers to make an octamer, which then activates CED-3 by a mechanism we will discuss shortly. Cell death soon follows (see Figure 21-36).

Evidence that the steps described here are sufficient to induce apoptosis comes from experiments in which these steps were reconstituted in vitro with purified proteins. CED-3, CED-4, a segment of the CED-9 protein that lacked its mitochondrial membrane anchor, and EGL-1 were purified, as

FIGURE 21-36 Activation of CED-3 protease in C. elegans. EGL-1 protein, which is produced in response to developmental signals that trigger cell death, displaces an asymmetric CED-4 dimer from its association with CED-9 (step (1). The free CED-4 dimer combines with three others to form an octamer (step 2), which binds two molecules of the

CED-3 zymogen (an enzymatically inactive precursor of a caspase protease) and triggers the conversion of the CED-3 zymogen into active CED-3 protease (step 3). This effector caspase then begins to destroy cell components, leading to cell death (step 4). See N. Yan et al., 2005, Nature 437:831, and S. Qi et al., 2010, Cell 141:446.
was a CED-4/CED-9 complex. Purified CED-4 (Apaf-1) was able to accelerate the autoproteolytic cleavage and activation of purified CED-3 (caspase-9), but addition of CED-9 (Bcl-2) to the reaction mixture inhibited the autocleavage. When the CED-4/CED-9 complex was mixed with CED-3, autocleavage did not occur, but addition of EGL-1 to the reaction mixture restored CED-3 autocleavage by releasing CED-4 from its complex with CED-9.

To see the importance of regulated EGL-1 expression in apoptosis, consider a class of neurons in C. elegans found in hermaphrodites, but not in males. These hermaphroditespecific neurons are generated embryonically in both hermaphrodites and males, but undergo programmed cell death in males. In hermaphrodites, expression of the egl-1 gene in these neurons is repressed by the transcription factor TRA1A, and deletion of TRA-1A in hermaphrodites causes these neurons to undergo apoptosis. This finding reinforces a point made earlier: all metazoan cells can potentially undergo apoptosis, so this process needs to be carefully regulated!

## Caspases Amplify the Initial Apoptotic Signal and Destroy Key Cellular Proteins

The effector proteases in the apoptotic pathway, the caspases, are so named because they contain a key cysteine residue in the catalytic site and selectively cleave proteins at sites just C-terminal to aspartate residues. Caspases work as homodimers, with one domain of each stabilizing the active site of the other. The principal caspase in C. elegans is CED-3, while humans have 14 different caspases. All caspases are initially made as procaspases; most require a proteolytic cleavage to become active. In vertebrates, initiator caspases (e.g., caspase-9) are activated by dimerization induced by binding to other types of proteins (e.g., Apaf-1), which help the initiator caspases to aggregate. Activated initiator caspases cleave effector caspases (e.g., caspase-3) to activate them; in this way, the proteolytic activity of the few activated initiator caspases becomes rapidly and hugely increased by activation
of the effector caspases, leading to a massive increase in the total caspase activity level in the cell (see Figure 21-35) and cell death. Procaspases preexist in large enough numbers to accomplish the digestion of much of the cellular protein when activated by the small number of molecules that constitute the initiation signal. The various effector caspases recognize and cleave short amino acid sequences in many different target proteins. They differ in their preferred target sequences. Their specific intracellular targets include proteins of the nuclear lamina and cytoskeleton whose cleavage leads to the demise of a cell.

As we learned in Chapter 7 (see page 282), the phospholipid phosphatidylserine is normally found in the inner, cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane. During apoptosis, increasing amounts of phosphatidylserine are found in the exoplasmic leaflet, where it acts as an "eat me" signal: it binds to a receptor-like protein on the surface of a neighboring cell that initiates engulfment. The multispanning, ubiquitously expressed C. elegans plasma membrane protein CED-8 and its mammalian homolog Xkr-8 are required for exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface. These phospholipid flippases (see Figure 11-16) are normally inactive, but are activated by a very specific cleavage catalyzed by caspase-3 or caspase-7 (see Figure 21-35) during apoptosis.

## Neurotrophins Promote Survival of Neurons

In mammals, but not in nematodes, apoptosis is regulated by intracellular signals generated from many secreted and cellsurface protein hormones, as well as by many environmental stresses, such as ultraviolet irradiation and DNA damage. While the "core" apoptosis machinery in C. elegans is conserved in mammals, many other intracellular proteins also regulate apoptosis (see Figure 21-35, right).

But before plunging into these molecular details, we'll illustrate the importance of trophic factors in apoptosis with a brief analysis of the developing nervous system.

When neurons grow to make connections to other neurons or to muscles, sometimes over considerable distances, more neurons grow than will eventually survive. The cell bodies of many sensory and motor neurons are located in the spinal cord and adjacent ganglia, while their long axons extend far outside these regions. Those neurons that make signaling connections, termed synapses (see Figure 22-3), with their intended target cells prevail and survive; those that fail to connect will die.

In the early 1900s, the number of neurons innervating peripheral cells was shown to depend on the size of the tissue to which they connect, the so-called target field. For instance, removal of limb buds from a developing chick embryo leads to a reduction in the number of both sensory and motor neurons innervating muscles in the bud (Figure 21-37). Conversely, grafting additional limb tissue to a limb bud leads to an increased number of neurons in the corresponding regions of the spinal cord and sensory ganglia. Indeed, incremental increases in target-field size are accompanied by commensurate incremental increases in the number of neurons innervating the target field. This relationship was found to result from the selective survival of neurons, rather than changes in their differentiation or proliferation. The observation that many sensory and motor neurons die after reaching their peripheral target field suggested that these neurons compete for survival factors produced by the target tissue.
![li11035345559](li11035345559.jpg)

Subsequent to these early observations, scientists discovered that transplantation of a mouse sarcoma (muscle tumor) into a chick led to a marked increase in the local numbers of certain types of neurons. This finding implicated the tumor as a rich source of a presumed trophic factor. To isolate and purify this factor, known simply as nerve growth factor (NGF), scientists used cell culture assays in which outgrowth of neurites from sensory ganglia was measured. Neurites are extensions of the neuronal cytoplasm that can grow to become the long processes of the nervous system, the axons and dendrites (see Figure 22-1). The later discovery that the submaxillary gland of the mouse also produces large quantities of NGF enabled Rita Levi-Montalcini to purify and sequence it; she was rewarded with a Nobel Prize. A homodimer of two 118 -residue polypeptides, NGF belongs to a family of structurally and functionally related trophic factors collectively referred to as neurotrophins. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) are also members of this protein family.

Neurotrophins bind to and activate a family of receptor tyrosine kinases called Trks (pronounced "tracks"). (The general structure of receptor tyrosine kinases and the intracellular signaling pathways they activate are covered in Chapter 16.) Each neurotrophin binds with high affinity to one type of Trk receptor: NGF binds to TrkA; BDNF, to TrkB; and NT-3, to TrkC. NT-3 can also bind with lower affinity to both TrkA and TrkB. All neurotrophins also bind to a distinct type of receptor called p75 ${ }^{\text {NTR }}$ (also called NTR 5 neurotrophin receptor), but with lower affinity; p75 ${ }^{\text {NTR }}$ forms heteromeric complexes with the different Trk receptors. These binding relationships between trophic factors and their receptors provide survival signals for different classes of neurons. As nerve exons extend outward from the spinal cord to the periphery, neurotrophins produced by their target tissues bind to Trk receptors on the growth cones (see Figure 18-54) at the tips of the extending axons, promoting survival of those neurons that successfully reach their targets.

To investigate the role of neurotrophins in development, scientists produced mice with knockout mutations in each of the neurotrophins or their receptors. These studies revealed that different neurotrophins and their corresponding

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-37 In vertebrates, the survival of motor neurons depends on the size of the muscle target field they innervate. (a) Removal of a limb bud from one side of a chick embryo at about 2.5 days results in a marked decrease in the number of motor neurons on the affected side. In an amputated embryo (top), normal numbers of motor neurons are generated on both sides (middle). Later in development, however, many fewer motor neurons remain on the side of the spinal cord with the missing limb than on the normal side (bottom). Note that only about 50 percent of the motor neurons that are generated normally survive. (b) Transplantation of an extra limb bud into an early chick embryo produces the opposite effect, more motor neurons on the side with additional target tissue than on the normal side. See D. Purves, 1988, Body and Brain: A Trophic Theory of Neural Connections, Harvard University Press, and E. R. Kandel, J. H. Schwartz, and T. M. Jessell, 2000, Principles of Neural Science, 4th ed., McGraw-Hill, p. 1054, Figure 53-11.

receptors are required for the survival of different classes of sensory neurons (Figure 21-38). For instance, pain-sensitive (nociceptive) neurons, which express TrkA, are selectively lost from the dorsal root ganglion of knockout mice lacking NGF or TrkA, whereas TrkB- and TrkC-expressing neurons are unaffected in such knockouts. In contrast, TrkC-expressing proprioceptive neurons, which detect the position of the limbs, are missing from the dorsal root ganglion in TrkC and NT-3 mutants.

## Mitochondria Play a Central Role in Regulation of Apoptosis in Vertebrate Cells

As discussed previously, C. elegans CED-9 and its mammalian homolog Bcl-2 play central roles in repressing apoptosis. In nematodes, CED-9 does so by binding to and blocking the activation of CED-4. In vertebrates, Bcl-2, residing in
the outer mitochondrial membrane, primarily functions to maintain the low permeability of that membrane, preventing cytochrome $c$ and other proteins localized to the intermembrane space (see Figure 12-22) from diffusing into the cytosol and activating apoptotic caspases.

In order to explain how Bcl-2 carries out this function, and how Bcl-2 activity is regulated by trophic factors as well as by many environmental stimuli, we need to introduce several other important members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. All members of the Bcl-2 family share a close homology in up to four characteristic regions, termed the Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4; Figure 21-39). Each of these proteins has either an anti-apoptotic or a pro-apoptotic function. All members of this family participate in oligomeric interactions; many have hydrophobic sequences at their C-termini that can anchor the proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 21-38 Different classes of sensory neurons are lost in knockout mice lacking different trophic factors or their receptors. In animals lacking nerve growth factor (NGF) or its receptor TrkA, small nociceptive (pain-sensing) neurons (light blue) that innervate the skin are missing. These neurons express the TrkA receptor and innervate NGF-producing target tissues. In animals

FIGURE 21-39 Structures of members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. The Bcl-2 family, which comprises proteins that contain functional Bcl-2 homology domains (BH1-4), can be divided into three classes. All of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins, but only some of the BH3-only proteins, contain a hydrophobic and presumably transmembrane (TM) domain that may function to anchor the protein in the outer mitochondrial membrane. See M. Giam et al., 2009, Oncogene 27:S128.

## The Pro-apoptotic Proteins Bax and Bak Form Pores and Holes in the Outer Mitochondrial Membrane

In vertebrate cells, Bax or Bak is required for mitochondrial damage and induction of apoptosis. These two similar proapoptotic proteins contain three of the BH1-4 domains (see Figure 21-39) and have three-dimensional structures very similar to that of the anti-apoptotic members of the family. As evidence for the role of these proteins in promoting apoptosis, most mice lacking both Bax and Bak die in utero, and those that survive show significant developmental defects, including the persistence of interdigital webs and accumulation of extra cells in the central nervous and hematopoietic systems. Cells isolated from these mice are resistant to virtually all apoptotic stimuli. Conversely, overproduction of Bax in cultured cells induces apoptotic death.

Bak resides in the outer mitochondrial membrane, normally tightly bound to $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ or the related protein $\mathrm{Bcl}-\mathrm{xL}$ (Figure 21-40). When released from Bcl-2-either by being present in excess, by being displaced by the binding of certain BH3-only proteins to Bcl-2, or by binding directly to other BH3-only proteins-Bak forms oligomers that generate pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Bax is mainly cytosolic, with a small fraction attached to mitochondria; binding of certain pro-apoptotic proteins, discussed later, causes Bax, like Bak, to oligomerize and insert into the outer mitochondrial membrane, forming pores.

Recall from Chapter 12 that mitochondria are constantly undergoing fusion as well as fission (the latter when two daughter mitochondria separate from each other). Both Bak and Bax, when oligomerized, accumulate at sites of mitochondrial fission, causing holes to form in the outer membrane at those sites. Both pores and holes in the outer mitochondrial membrane allow release into the cytosol of mitochondrial proteins such as cytochrome $c$ that, in normal healthy cells, are localized to the intermembrane space.

As depicted in Figure 21-35, released cytochrome $c$ activates caspase-9-in part by binding to and activating Apaf-1 and in part through as yet unknown mechanisms. As evidence for this regulatory pathway, overproduction of Bcl-2 in cultured cells blocks release of cytochrome $c$ and blocks apoptosis; conversely, overproduction of Bax promotes release of cytochrome $c$ into the cytosol and promotes apoptosis. Moreover, injection of cytochrome $c$ directly into the cytosol of cells induces apoptosis.

## Release of Cytochrome c and SMAC/DIABLO Proteins from Mitochondria Leads to Formation of the Apoptosome and Caspase Activation

The principal way in which cytochrome $c$ in the cytosol activates apoptosis is by binding Apaf-1, the mammalian homolog of CED-4 (see Figure 21-35, right). In the absence of cytochrome $c$, monomeric Apaf-1 is bound to dATP. After binding cytochrome $c$, Apaf-1 cleaves its bound dATP into dADP and $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{i}}$ and undergoes a dramatic assembly into
a disk-shaped heptamer, a 1.4-MDa wheel of death called the apoptosome (Figure 21-41). The apoptosome serves as an activation machine for the initiator caspase caspase-9, which is monomeric in the inactive state. Initiator caspases must be sensitive to activation signals, yet should not be activatable in an irreversible manner because accidental activation would lead to an undesirable snowball effect and rapid cell death. Significantly, caspase- 9 does not require cleavage to become activated, but rather is activated by dimerization following binding to the apoptosome. Caspase-9 then cleaves multiple molecules of effector caspases, such as caspase-3 (see Figures 21-35 and 21-40), leading to their activation and subsequent destruction of cell proteins and cell death. The three-dimensional structure of the corresponding nematode CED-4 apoptosome (Figure 21-41c) shows how two CED-3 procaspases bind adjacent to each other on the inside of the funnel-shaped octamer; these molecules then activate each other by dimerization and proteolytic conversion. The structure of the CED-4 apoptosome also provides a model for the as yet unknown three-dimensional structure of the corresponding mammalian apoptosome (Figure 21-41b, right).

In mammals and flies, but not in nematodes, apoptosis is regulated by several other proteins (see Figure 21-35, right). XIAP, one member of a family of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), provides another way to restrain both initiator and effector caspases. XIAP has three N-terminal BIR domains; the one termed BIR2 binds to and inhibits two effector caspases, caspase-3 and caspase-7, while BIR3 binds to and inhibits initiator caspase-9. (Other members of the IAP family inhibit apoptosis induced by TNF $\alpha$; see Figure 21-42 below.) The inhibition of caspases by IAPs, however, creates a problem when a cell needs to undergo apoptosis. Mitochondria enter the picture once again, since they are the source of a family of proteins, called SMAC/ DIABLOs, that inhibit IAPs. Assembly of Bax or Bak oligomers (see Figure 21-40) leads to the release of SMAC/DIABLOs, as well as cytochrome $c$, from mitochondria. SMAC/ DIABLOs then bind to XIAP in the cytosol, thereby blocking XIAP from binding to caspases. By relieving XIAPmediated inhibition, SMAC/DIABLOs promote caspase activity and cell death.

## Trophic Factors Induce Inactivation of Bad, a Pro-apoptotic BH3-Only Protein

We saw earlier that neurotrophins such as NGF protect neurons from cell death; this effect is mediated by inactivation of a pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein called Bad. In the absence of trophic factors, Bad is nonphosphorylated and binds to $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$, or to the closely related anti-apoptotic protein $\mathrm{Bcl}-\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{L}}$, at the outer mitochondrial membrane (see Figure 21-40). This binding inhibits the ability of $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ and $\mathrm{Bcl}-\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{L}}$ to bind Bax and Bak, thereby allowing Bak and Bax to oligomerize and form pores and holes in the outer mitochondrial membrane.

A number of trophic factors, including NGF, induce the PI-3 kinase signaling pathway, leading to the activation

![li11335345559](li11335345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-40 Integration of multiple signaling pathways in vertebrate cells that regulate outer mitochondrial membrane permeability and apoptosis. In healthy cells, the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, or its homolog Bcl-xL, binds to Bak or Bax pro-apoptotic proteins, blocking the ability of Bak or Bax to oligomerize and form pores in the outer mitochondrial membrane. Binding of any of several BH3-only proteins, including Bad, Bim, and Puma, to Bcl-2 or directly to Bak or Bax causes Bak or Bax to dissociate from Bcl-2 and form oligomeric pores and holes in the outer mitochondrial membrane. These holes allow cytochrome $c$ to enter the cytosol, where it binds to the adapter protein Apaf-1, promoting caspase activation that initiates the apoptotic cascade and leads to cell death. Several stimuli trigger or repress this apoptotic pathway. Step The presence of specific trophic factors (e.g., NGF) leads to activation of their cognate receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., TrkA) and
activation of the PI-3 kinase-PKB (protein kinase B) pathway (see Figure 16-29). PKB phosphorylates Bad, and phosphorylated Bad then forms a complex with a cytosolic 14-3-3 protein. This sequestered Bad is unable to bind to Bcl-2. In the absence of trophic factors, nonphosphorylated Bad binds to Bcl-2, releasing Bax and Bak and allowing them to form oligomeric membrane pores and holes. Step DNA damage or ultraviolet irradiation leads to induction of synthesis of the BH3-only Puma protein. Puma binds to Bak and Bax as well as to Bcl-2, allowing Bak and Bax to form oligomeric pores. Step $\mathbf{\square}$ Removal of a cell from its substratum disrupts integrin signaling, leading to release of the BH3-only Bim protein from the cytoskeleton. Bim also binds to Bak and Bax to promote pore formation. See D. Ren et al., 2010, Science 330:1390 and Czabootar et al., 2014, Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 15:49.
of protein kinase B (see Figure 16-29). Activated protein kinase B phosphorylates Bad; phosphorylated Bad cannot bind to $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ or $\mathrm{Bcl}-\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and is found in the cytosol complexed to the phosphoserine-binding protein 14-3-3 (see Figure 16-24). As evidence for this pathway, a constitutively active form of protein kinase B can rescue cultured
neurotrophin-deprived neurons, which would otherwise undergo apoptosis and die. These findings support the mechanism for the survival action of trophic factors depicted in Figure 21-40. In other cell types, different trophic factors may promote cell survival through post-translational modification of other components of the cell-death machinery.

## Vertebrate Apoptosis Is Regulated by BH3-Only Pro-apoptotic Proteins That Are Activated by Environmental Stresses

Whereas nematodes contain a single BH3-only protein, EGL1, mammals express at least eight, including Bad, in a cell type- and stress-specific manner. The pro-apoptotic activities
of these proteins are tightly regulated by diverse transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Two BH3-only proteins, Puma and Noxa (see Figure 21-40), are transcriptionally induced by the p53 protein (see Figure 19-29). This interaction is part of the checkpoint pathway by which unrepaired damage to DNA can induce apoptosis; thus the loss of p53 seen in many cancers allows cells to live with severe

![li11535345559](li11535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 21-42 Cell murder: the extrinsic apoptosis pathway.
Extrinsic (or death receptor-regulated) apoptosis pathways are found in many types of cells. In this example, binding of TNF $\alpha$ on the surface of one cell to the TNF $\alpha$ death receptor on an adjacent cell leads to recruitment of the adapter proteins TRADD (TNF receptor-associated death domain protein) and FADD (Fas-associated death domain protein) and the dimerization and activation of the initiator caspase-8. Active cas-pase-8 then cleaves and activates effector caspases-3, -6, and -7, which cleave vital cellular proteins and induce cell death. Cleavage of the BH3only protein Bid (BH3-interacting-domain death agonist) by caspase-8 generates a tBid fragment that binds to Bcl-2 on the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to release of cytochrome $c$ into the cytosol and activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (see Figure 21-39) as well. See P. Bouillet and L. O'Reilly, 2009, Nat. Rev. Immunol. 9:514, and A. Ashkenazi and G. Salvesen, 2014, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 30:20.

DNA damage (see Figure 24-27). Another BH3-only protein, Bim, is normally sequestered by the microtubule cytoskeleton by binding to a dynein light chain (see Figure 18-24). Detachment of cells from their substratum disrupts integrin signaling, rearranges the cytoskeleton, and leads to release of Bim. Both Puma and Bim bind directly to Bak and Bax as well as to Bcl-2, releasing Bak and Bax from Bcl-2
and allowing formation of pores and holes in the outer mitochondrial membrane (see Figure 21-40). Thus apoptosis of mammalian cells is regulated by a careful balance of activities of anti-apoptotic proteins such as $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ and $\mathrm{Bcl}-\mathrm{x}_{\mathrm{L}}$ and multiple pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins.

## Two Types of Cell Murder Are Triggered by Tumor Necrosis Factor, Fas Ligand, and Related Death Signals

Although cell death can arise as a default in the absence of survival factors, apoptosis can also be stimulated by positively acting death signals. For instance, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF $\alpha$ ), which is released by macrophages, triggers the cell death and tissue destruction seen in certain chronic inflammatory diseases (see Chapter 23). Another important death-inducing signal, the Fas ligand, is a cell-surface protein produced by activated natural killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. This signal can trigger death of virus-infected cells, some tumor cells, and foreign graft cells. Depending on the type of cell, death can be by apoptosis or necroptosis.

Both TNF $\alpha$, depicted in Figure 21-42, and the Fas ligand (also called CD95 ligand) are trimeric proteins present on the surface of one cell that bind to "death receptors" on an adjacent cell. These death receptors have a single transmembrane domain and are activated when binding of a trimeric ligand brings three receptor molecules into close proximity. The activated trimeric death receptor complex then binds cytosolic proteins termed Fas-associated death domain protein (FADD) and TNF receptor-associated death domain protein (TRADD), forming a large oligomeric complex that contains other signaling proteins as well. (TRADD is required for the induction of apoptosis by some death receptors, such as those for TNF $\alpha$, but not by others.) FADD then serves as an adapter to recruit and activate caspase-8, an initiator caspase. Like the other initiator caspase, caspase-9, caspase-8 is activated by dimerization following binding of two molecules to the FADD proteins recruited to an active death receptor trimer. Once activated, caspase- 8 activates several effector caspases and the amplification cascade begins.

Caspase-8 also cleaves the BH3-only protein BH3-interacting-domain death agonist (Bid). The resulting tBid fragment then binds to $\mathrm{Bcl}-2$ on the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to the formation of $\mathrm{Bak} / \mathrm{Bax}$ pores and holes, release of cytochrome $c$ into the cytosol, and activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (see Figure 21-40) as well.

To test the ability of the death receptor for the Fas ligand to induce cell death, researchers incubated cells with antibodies against the receptor. These antibodies, which bind and cross-link their cognate receptors, were found to stimulate cell death, indicating that activation of this receptor by oligomerization is sufficient to trigger apoptosis.

It came as a surprise to many researchers that, in cells lacking initiator caspase-8, addition of TNF $\alpha$ triggered necroptosis rather than apoptosis. The pathway is initiated by the same protein complex-TNF $\alpha$, the TNF $\alpha$ receptor

and TRADD—depicted in Figure 21-42, but does not involve FADD or caspase-8. There are several signal transduction proteins involved in the pathway; one essential protein is the kinase RIP1 (Requiescat in pace 1). When activated, RIP1 phosphorylates a second kinase, RIP3, and RIP3 phosphorylates another essential protein termed MLKL. Phosphorylation causes MLKL to form an oligomer that inserts into the plasma membrane and forms a hole, allowing $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry. The influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ causes the cell and its organelles to swell and burst, releasing its contents into the extracellular space. Some of these released intracellular proteins trigger activation of immune-system cells and cause tissue inflammation and damage. Inflammation due to necroptosis has been implicated in mediating several human diseases, including neurodegeneration and progressive atherosclerotic lesions. As we discussed in Chapter 16, protein inhibitors of TNF $\alpha$ are among the most widely used therapeutics for many inflammatory diseases; inhibiting RIP1 kinase is another promising approach to treat human diseases characterized by necrosis and inflammation.

But why would such a harmful signaling pathway have evolved in the first place? One popular theory relates to the finding that several viruses and other pathogens encode proteins that inactivate caspase- 8 , thus preventing the infected cells from undergoing the apoptotic death that would otherwise prevent the virus from replicating and the infection from spreading to neighboring cells. Necroptosis, which occurs only in the absence of caspase- 8 , would provide an alternative pathway for cell death that also prevents pathogen spread, but at a cost to the host organism-inflammation.

Recall that TNF $\alpha$ activates multiple signal transduction pathways: one leads to activation of the transcription factor NF- $\kappa$ B (see Figure 16-35), a second to apoptosis (see Figure 21-42), and the third to necroptosis. Much work needs to be done to understand the regulation of each of these pathways and their interactions, as this hormone is involved in many inflammatory diseases.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 21.5

## Cell Death and Its Regulation

- All cells require trophic factors to survive. In the absence of these factors, cells commit suicide.
- Genetic studies in C. elegans have defined an evolutionarily conserved apoptotic pathway with three major components: membrane-bound regulatory proteins, cytosolic regulatory proteins, and apoptotic proteases (called caspases in vertebrates) (see Figure 21-35).
- Once activated, apoptotic proteases called caspases cleave specific intracellular substrates, leading to the demise of a cell. Other proteins (e.g., CED-4, Apaf-1) that bind regulatory proteins and caspases are required for caspase activation (see Figures 21-35, 21-36, and 21-41).
- Survival of motor and sensory neurons during development is mediated by neurotrophins released from target tissues that bind to Trk receptor tyrosine kinases on the neuronal growth cones (see Figure 21-38), activating an anti-apoptotic response via the PI-3 kinase pathway (see Figure 21-40).
- The Bcl-2 family contains both pro-apoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins; most are transmembrane proteins and engage in protein-protein interactions.
- In mammals, apoptosis can be triggered by oligomerization of Bax or Bak proteins in the outer mitochondrial membrane, leading to efflux of cytochrome $c$ and SMAC/DIABLO proteins into the cytosol; these proteins then promote caspase activation and cell death.
- Bcl-2 proteins can restrain the oligomerization of Bax and Bak, inhibiting cell death.
- Pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (e.g., Puma, Bad) are activated by environmental stress and stimulate the oligomerization of Bax and Bak, allowing cytochrome $c$ to escape into the cytosol, bind to Apaf-1, and thus activate caspases.
- Direct interactions between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins lead to cell death in the absence of trophic factors. Binding of extracellular trophic factors can trigger changes in these interactions, resulting in cell survival (see Figure 21-40).
- Binding of extracellular death signals, such as tumor necrosis factor and Fas ligand, to their receptors oligomerizes an associated protein (FADD), which in turn triggers the caspase cascade, leading to cell murder by apoptosis.
- In the absence of caspase-8, tumor necrosis factor induces necroptosis. Intracellular proteins released into the surroundings as a result can cause inflammation and tissue damage.

## Review the Concepts

1. What two properties define a stem cell? Distinguish between a totipotent stem cell, a pluripotent stem cell, and a precursor (progenitor) cell.
2. Where are stem cells located in plants? Where are stem cells located in adult animals? How does the concept of a stem cell differ between animal and plant systems?
3. In 1997, Dolly the sheep was cloned by a technique called somatic-cell nuclear transfer (or nuclear-transfer cloning). A nucleus from an adult mammary cell was transferred into an egg from which the nucleus had been removed. The egg was allowed to divide several times in culture, then the embryo was transferred to a surrogate mother who gave birth to Dolly. Dolly died in 2003 after mating and giving birth herself to viable offspring. What does the creation of Dolly tell us about the potential of nuclear material derived from a fully differentiated adult cell? Does the creation of Dolly tell us anything about the potential of an intact, fully differentiated adult cell? 4. Identify whether the following contain totipotent, pluripotent, or multipotent cells: (a) inner cell mass, (b) morula, (c) eight-cell embryo, (d) trophectoderm.
4. True or false: Differentiated somatic cells have the capacity to become reprogrammed to become other cell types. Provide one line of evidence discussed in the chapter that corroborates your response.
5. Explain how intestinal stem cells were first identified and then experimentally shown to be multipotent stem cells.
6. Explain how hematopoietic stem cells were experimentally shown to be both multipotent and capable of self-renewal.
7. The nematode C. elegans has proved to be a valuable model organism for studies of cell birth, cell asymmetry, and cell death. What properties of C. elegans render it so well suited for these studies? Why is so much information from C. elegans experiments of use to investigators interested in mammalian development?
8. Asymmetric cell division often relies on cytoskeletal elements to generate or maintain the asymmetric distribution of cellular factors. In S. cerevisiae, what factor is localized to the bud by myosin motors? In Drosophila neuroblasts, what factors are localized apically by microtubules?
9. Discuss the role of par genes in generating anterior/posterior polarity in the C. elegans embryo.
10. How do studies of brain development in knockout mice support the statement that apoptosis is a default pathway in neuronal cells?
11. Compare and contrast cell death by apoptosis and by necrosis.
12. Identify and list the functions of the three general classes of proteins that control cell death.
13. Based on your understanding of the events surrounding cell death, predict the effect(s) of the following on the ability of a cell to undergo apoptosis:
a. Functional CED-9; nonfunctional CED-3
b. Active Bax and cytochrome c; nonfunctional caspase-9
c. Inactive PI-3 kinase; active Bad
14. TNF and Fas ligand bind cell-surface receptors to trigger cell death. Although the death signal is generated external to the cell, why do we consider the death induced by these molecules to be apoptotic rather than necrotic?
15. Predict the effects of the following mutations on the ability of a cell to undergo apoptosis:
a. Mutation in Bad such that it cannot be phosphorylated by protein kinase B (PKB)
b. Overexpression of Bcl-2
c. Mutation in Bax such that it cannot form homodimers

One common characteristic of cancer cells is a loss of function in the apoptotic pathway. Which of the mutations listed above might you expect to find in some cancer cells? 17. How do IAPs (inhibitors of apoptosis proteins) interact with caspases to prevent apoptosis? How do mitochondrial proteins interact with IAPs to prevent inhibition of apoptosis?

CLARITY renders tissue optically transparent, permitting deep and complete imaging of tissues, including brains. Section was stained with antibodies to GFP and color-coded by depth to facilitate individual neuron visualization. The final image is assembled from over 8500 individual images digitally stitched together over a $750-\mu \mathrm{m}$ thick piece of brain. This approach provides unprecedented opportunity to image intact brains at cellular resolution, paving the way to a comprehensive understanding of how the brain is wired. [Luis de la Torre-Ubieta, Geschwind Laboratory, UCLA, Wellcome Images.]

The nervous system regulates all aspects of bodily function and is staggering in its complexity. The $1.3-\mathrm{kg}$ adult human brain-the control center that stores, computes, integrates, and transmits information-contains nearly 100 billion nerve cells, called neurons. These neurons are interconnected by some 100 trillion synapses, the junction points where two or more neurons communicate. An individual neuron can form synapses with up to 10,000 other neurons.

Neurons are organized into interconnected units or circuits that have discrete functions. Some circuits sense features of both the external and internal environments of organisms and transmit this information to the brain for processing and storage. Others regulate the contraction of muscles and the secretion of hormones. Yet other circuits regulate cognition, emotion, and innate as well as learned behaviors. In addition to neurons, the nervous system contains glial cells. Historically considered to function simply as support cells for neurons, it is now recognized that glia play active roles in brain function.

The biology of the cells of the nervous system is remarkable on two levels. First, neurons are the most morphologically

polarized and compartmentalized cells in the body, and thus pose great challenges to many cell biological processes, from cytoskeletal dynamics and membrane trafficking to signal transduction and gene regulation. Second, individual neurons and glia combine to form exquisitely complex and precise networks or circuits. Neural circuits are not hard wired, but instead the connectivity of neurons changes with experience through a process known as synaptic plasticity, in which experience modifies the strength and number of synaptic connections between neurons. A central focus of modern brain biology is understanding the logic underlying both the formation and the plasticity of neural circuits. While the structure and function of nerve cells is understood in great detail-perhaps in more detail than for any other cell type-the mechanisms by which neural circuits form, change with experience, and process and compute information remain a mystery. These issues represent some of the most exciting areas of twenty-first-century biology and inspired President Obama to launch the Brain Research through Advancing Innovative Neurotechnologies (BRAIN) Initiative in 2013. The BRAIN Initiative is a large-scale national effort to develop new technologies to study individual cells and complex neural

circuits, with the goal of gaining a dynamic view of the human brain in action.

The vertebrate nervous system is anatomically divided into the central nervous system, which contains the nerves and glia located inside the brain and spinal cord, and the peripheral nervous system, which contains the nerves and glia located outside the brain and spinal cord. Despite being anatomically separate, the central and peripheral nervous systems are functionally interconnected, with peripheral nerves serving as communication conduits between the brain and the body. The central nervous system itself can be divided into four primary components: the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebrum. Each region has discrete functions. For example, the spinal cord conducts sensory and motor information from the body to the brain, the brainstem regulates breathing and blood pressure, the cerebellum controls motor function, and the cerebrum processes motor and sensory information, language, learning and memory, and other higher-level functions. Although one finds neurons and glia that have distinct properties and characteristics specific to these various regions, the functional specialization of each brain region emerges primarily from differences in circuit connectivity rather than from differences in constituent cell types.

Indeed, despite the multiple types and shapes of neurons that are found in metazoan organisms, all nerve cells share common properties that make them specialized for communicating information using a combination of electrical and chemical signaling. Electrical signals process and conduct information within neurons, which are usually highly polarized cells with extensions whose lengths are orders of magnitude greater than the cell soma (Figure 22-1). The electrical pulses that travel along neurons are called action potentials, and information is encoded as the frequency at which action potentials are fired. Owing to the speed of electrical transmission, neurons are champion signal transducers, much faster than cells that secrete hormones. In contrast to the electrical signals that conduct information within a neuron, chemical signals transmit information between cells, utilizing processes similar to those employed by other types of signaling cells (Chapters 15 and 16).

Taken together, the electrical and chemical signaling of the nervous system allows it to detect external stimuli, integrate and process the information received, relay it to higher brain centers, and generate an appropriate response to the stimulus. For example, sensory neurons have specialized receptors that convert diverse types of stimuli from the environment (e.g., light, touch, sound, odorants) into electrical signals. These electrical signals are then converted into chemical signals that are passed on to other cells called interneurons, which convert the information back into electrical signals. Ultimately the information is transmitted to muscle-stimulating motor neurons or to other neurons that stimulate other types of cells, such as glands.

In this chapter we will focus on neurobiology at the cellular and molecular level. We will start by looking at the general architecture of neurons, at how they carry signals, and
at how neurons and glia arise from stem cells. Next we will focus on ion flow, channel proteins, and membrane properties: how electrical pulses move rapidly along neurons. Third, we will examine communication between neurons: electrical signals traveling along a cell must be translated into a chemical pulse between cells and then back into an electrical signal in the receiving cells. We will then examine neurons in several sensory tissues, including those that mediate our senses of touch, taste and olfaction. The speed, precision, and integrative power of neural signaling enable the accurate and timely sensory perception of a swiftly changing environment. In the last section, we will turn to the circuits, neurons, and cell biological mechanisms underlying the storage of memories.

A great deal of information about nerve cells has been gleaned from analyses of humans, mice, nematodes, and flies with mutations that affect specific functions of the nervous system. In addition, molecular cloning and structural analysis of key neuronal proteins, such as voltage-gated ion channels and receptors, have helped elucidate the cellular machinery underlying complex brain functions such as instinct, learning, memory, and emotion.

### 22.1 Neurons and Glia: Building Blocks of the Nervous System

In this section we examine the structure of neurons and how they propagate electrical and chemical signals. Neurons are distinguished by their elongated, asymmetric shape, by their highly localized proteins and organelles, and most of all by a set of proteins that controls the flow of ions across the plasma membrane. Because one neuron can respond to the inputs from multiple neurons, generate electrical signals, and transmit the signals to multiple neurons, a nervous system has considerable powers of signal analysis. For example, a neuron might transmit a signal only if it receives five simultaneous activating signals from input neurons. The receiving neuron measures both the amount of incoming signal and whether the five signals are roughly synchronous. Fast synaptic input from one neuron to another can be either excitatory-combining with other signals to trigger electrical transduction in the receiving cell-or inhibitory, discouraging such transmission. In addition to excitatory and inhibitory synapses, neurons receive slower neuromodulatory inputs such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine, which activate G protein-coupled receptors (see Chapter 15) to change the threshold for excitation or inhibition. Thus the properties and connections of individual neurons set the stage for integration and refinement of information. The output of a nervous system is the result of its circuit properties, that is, the wiring or interconnections between neurons, and the strength of these interconnections. We will begin by looking at how signals are received and sent, and in subsequent parts of the chapter we will look at the molecular details of the machinery involved.

## Information Flows Through Neurons from Dendrites to Axons

Neurons arise from roughly spherical neuroblast precursors. Newly born neurons can migrate long distances before growing into dramatically elongated cells. Fully differentiated neurons take many forms, but generally share certain key features (see Figure 22-1). The nucleus is found in a rounded part of the cell called the cell body. Branching cell processes called dendrites (from the Greek for "treelike") are found at one end, and are the main structures where signals are received from other neurons via synapses. Incoming signals are also received at synapses that form on neuronal cell bodies. Neurons often have extremely long dendrites with complex branches, particularly in the central nervous system (i.e., the brain and spinal cord). This allows them to form synapses with, and receive signals from, a large number of other neurons-up to tens of thousands. Thus the converging dendritic branches allow signals from many cells to be received and integrated by a single neuron.

When a neuron is first differentiating, the end of the cell opposite the dendrites undergoes dramatic outgrowth to form a long extended arm called the axon, which is essentially a transmission wire. The growth of axons must be controlled so that proper connections are formed, through a complex process called axon guidance that involves dynamic changes to the cytoskeleton and is discussed in Section 18.8. The diameters of axons vary from just a micrometer in certain neurons of the human brain to a millimeter in the giant fiber of the squid. Axons can be meters in length (e.g., in giraffe necks), and are often partly covered with electrical insulation called the myelin sheath (see Figure 22-1b), which is made by specific classes of glial cells, oligodendrocytes (in the central nervous system) and Schwann cells (in the peripheral nervous system). The insulation speeds electrical
transmission and prevents short circuits. The short, branched ends of the axon at the opposite end of the neuron from the dendrites are called the axon termini. This is where signals are passed along to the next neuron or to another type of cell such as a muscle or hormone-secreting cell. The asymmetry of the neuron, with dendrites at one end and axon termini at the other, is indicative of the unidirectional flow of information from dendrites to axons.

## Information Moves Along Axons as Pulses of Ion Flow Called Action Potentials

Nerve cells are members of a class of excitable cells, which also includes muscle cells, cells in the pancreas, and some others. Like all metazoan cells, excitable cells have an inside-negative voltage or electric potential gradient across their plasma membranes, the membrane potential (see Chapter 11). In excitable cells this potential can suddenly become zero or even reversed, with the inside of the cell positive with respect to the outside of the plasma membrane. The membrane voltage in a typical neuron, called the resting potential because it is the state when no signal is in transit, is established by $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ion pumps in the plasma membrane. These are the same ion pumps used by other cells to generate a resting potential. $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$ion pumps use energy, in the form of ATP, to move positively charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions out of the cell and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions inward. Subsequent movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$out of the cell through resting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels results in a net negative charge inside the cell compared with the outside. The typical resting potential of a neuron is about -70 mV .

Neurons have a language all their own. They use their unique electrical properties to send signals. The signals take the form of brief local voltage changes, from inside-negative

FIGURE 22-1 Typical morphology of two types of mammalian neurons. Action potentials arise in the axon hillock and are conducted toward the axon terminus. (a) A multipolar interneuron has profusely branched dendrites, which receive signals at synapses with several hundred other neurons. Small voltage changes imparted by inputs in the dendrites can sum to give rise to the more massive action potential, which starts in the hillock. A single long axon that branches laterally at its terminus transmits signals to other neurons. (b) A motor neuron innervating a muscle cell typically has a single long axon extending from the cell body to the effector cell. In mammalian motor neurons, an insulating sheath of myelin usually covers all parts of the axon except at the nodes of Ranvier and the axon termini. The myelin sheath is composed of cells called glia.

to inside-positive, an event designated depolarization. A powerful surge of depolarizing voltage change, moving from one end of the neuron to the other, is called an action potential. "Depolarization" is somewhat of a misnomer, since the neuron suddenly goes from inside-negative to neutral to inside-positive, which could be more accurately described as depolarization followed by the opposite polarization (Figure 22-2). At the peak of an action potential, the membrane potential can be as much as +50 mV (inside-positive), a net change of -120 mV . As we shall see in greater detail in Section 22.2, an action potential moves along the axon to the axon terminus at speeds of up to 100 meters per second. In humans, for instance, axons may be more than a meter long, yet it takes only a few milliseconds for an action potential to move along their length. Neurons can fire repeatedly after a brief recovery period, for example, every 4 milliseconds (ms), as in Figure 22-2. After the action potential passes through a section of a neuron, channel proteins and pumps restore the inside-negative resting potential (repolarization). The restoration process chases the action potential down the axon to the terminus, leaving the neuron ready to signal again.

Importantly, action potentials are "all or none." Once the threshold to start one is reached, a full firing occurs. The signal information is therefore carried primarily not by the intensity of the action potentials, but by the timing and frequency of them.

Some excitable cells are not neurons. Muscle contraction is triggered by motor neurons that synapse directly on excitable muscle cells (see Figure 22-1b). Insulin secretion from the $\beta$-islet cells of the pancreas is triggered by neurons. In both cases the activating event involves an opening of plasma membrane channels that causes changes in the

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 22-2 Recording of an axonal membrane potential over time reveals the amplitude and frequency of action potentials. An action potential is a sudden, transient depolarization of the membrane, followed by repolarization to the resting potential of about -70 mV . The axonal membrane potential can be measured with a small electrode placed into it (see Figure 11-19). This recording shows the neuron generating one action potential about every 4 milliseconds.
transmembrane flow of ions and in the electrical properties of the regulated cells.

## Information Flows Between Neurons via Synapses

What starts an action potential? Axon termini from one neuron are closely apposed to dendrites of another, at junctions called chemical synapses or simply synapses (Figure 22-3). The axon terminus of the presynaptic cell contains many small vesicles, termed synaptic vesicles, each of which is filled with a single kind of small molecule known as a neurotransmitter. Arrival of an action potential at a presynaptic terminus causes anv influx of calcium that triggers exocytosis of a small number of synaptic vesicles, releasing their content of neurotransmitter molecules.

Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse in about 0.5 ms and bind to receptors on the dendrite of the adjacent neuron. Binding of neurotransmitter triggers opening or closing of specific ion channels in the plasma membrane of postsynaptic cell dendrites, leading to changes in the membrane potential in this localized area of the postsynaptic cell. Generally these changes depolarize the postsynaptic membrane (making the potential less inside negative). The local depolarization, if large enough, triggers an action potential in the axon. Transmission is unidirectional, from the axon termini of the presynaptic cell to dendrites of the postsynaptic cell.

In some synapses, the effect of the neurotransmitters is to hyperpolarize and therefore lower the likelihood of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. A single axon in the central nervous system can synapse with many neurons and induce responses in all of them simultaneously. Conversely, sometimes multiple neurons must act on the postsynaptic cell roughly synchronously to have a strong enough impact to trigger an action potential. Neuronal integration of depolarizing and hyperpolarizing signals determines the likelihood of an action potential.

Thus neurons employ a combination of extremely fast electrical transmission along the axon with rapid chemical communication between cells. This is known as electrochemical signaling. Now we will look at how a network of neurons, a circuit, can achieve a useful function.

## The Nervous System Uses Signaling Circuits Composed of Multiple Neurons

In complex multicellular animals, neurons form signaling circuits composed of three basic types of nerve cells: afferent neurons, interneurons, and efferent neurons. In circuits that relay information between the peripheral and central nervous systems, afferent neurons, also known as sensory or receptor neurons, carry nerve impulses from receptors or sense organs toward the central nervous system (i.e., the brain and spinal cord). These neurons report an event that has happened, like the arrival of a flash of light or the movement of a muscle. A touch or a painful stimulus creates a sensation in the brain only after information about the stimulus

![li11935345559](li11935345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-3 A chemical synapse. (a) A narrow region-the synaptic cleft—separates the plasma membranes of the presynaptic and postsynaptic cells. Arrival of action potentials in a presynaptic cell causes exocytosis at a synapse of a small number of synaptic vesicles, releasing their content of neurotransmitters (red circles). Following their diffusion across the synaptic cleft, the neurotransmitters bind to specific receptors on the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic cell. These signals either depolarize the postsynaptic membrane (making the potential inside less negative), tending to induce an action potential in the cell, or hyperpolarize the postsynaptic membrane (making the potential inside more negative), inhibiting action potential induction. (b) Electron micrograph showing a dendrite synapsing with an axon terminus filled with synaptic vesicles. In the synaptic region, the plasma membrane of the presynaptic cell is specialized for vesicle exocytosis; synaptic vesicles containing a neurotransmitter are clustered in these regions. The opposing membrane of the postsynaptic cell (in this case, a neuron) contains receptors for the neurotransmitter. (Part (b) Joseph F. Gennaro Jr./Science Source.)
travels there via afferent nerve pathways. Efferent neurons, also known as effector neurons, carry nerve impulses away from the central nervous system to generate a response. A motor neuron, for example, carries a signal to a muscle to stimulate its contraction (see Figure 22-1b); other effector
neurons stimulate hormone secretion by endocrine cells. Interneurons, the largest group, relay signals from afferent to efferent neurons and to other interneurons as part of a neural pathway. An interneuron can bridge multiple neurons, allowing integration or divergence of signals and sometimes extending the reach of a signal. In a simple type of circuit called a reflex arc, interneurons connect multiple sensory and motor neurons, allowing one sensory neuron to affect multiple motor neurons and one motor neuron to be affected by multiple sensory neurons; in this way interneurons integrate and enhance reflexes. For example, the kneejerk reflex in humans, illustrated in Figure 22-4, involves a complex reflex arc in which one muscle is stimulated to contract while another is inhibited from contracting. The reflex also sends information to the brain to announce what happened. Such circuits allow an organism to respond to a sensory input by the coordinated action of sets of muscles that together achieve a single purpose.

These simple signaling circuits, however, do not directly explain higher-order brain functions such as reasoning, computation, and memory development. Typical neurons in the brain receive signals from up to a thousand other neurons and, in turn, can direct chemical signals to many other neurons. The output of the nervous system depends on its circuit properties-the amount of wiring, or interconnections, between neurons and the strength of these interconnections. As complex and diverse as neural circuits are, they are comprised of a few basic patterns. These include divergence, in which one presynaptic neuron makes connections with many postsynaptic neurons; convergence, in which one postsynaptic neuron receives inputs from many presynaptic neurons; and feedback, in which the output of a postsynaptic neuron feeds back onto a presynaptic neuron or even onto itself (Figure 22-5). Feedback circuits form what are known as closed loops, in which the output of a system is used as the input. In a positive feedback circuit, the output sustains or increases the activity of the initial input. In a negative feedback circuit, the output inhibits the activity of the initial input.

## Glial Cells Form Myelin Sheaths and Support Neurons

For all the impressiveness of neurons, they are not the only cells in the human brain. Glial cells (also known as neuroglia or simply glia), which play many roles in the brain but do not themselves conduct electrical impulses, are present in large numbers throughout the brain. While many textbooks claim that glia outnumber neurons by 10 to 1 , recent experiments have suggested that the ratio of glia to neurons in the human brain is closer to $1: 1$, although there is significant variability between species and brain areas. For example, glia significantly outnumber neurons in the human cerebrum, while neurons greatly outnumber glia in the cerebellum. Of the four principal types of glia, two produce myelin sheaths-the insulation that surrounds neuronal axons (see Figure 22-1b): oligodendrocytes make sheaths for

FIGURE 22-4 The knee-jerk reflex. A tap of the hammer stretches the quadriceps muscle, thus triggering electrical activity in the stretch receptor sensory neuron. The action potential, traveling in the direction of the top blue arrow, sends signals to the brain so we are aware of what is happening, and also to two kinds of cells in the dorsal-root ganglion that is located in the spinal cord. One cell, a motor neuron that connects back to the quadriceps (red), stimulates muscle
contraction so that you kick the person who hammered your knee. The second connection activates, or "excites," an inhibitory interneuron (black). The interneuron has a damping effect, blocking activity by a flexor motor neuron (green) that would, in other circumstances, activate the hamstring muscle that opposes the quadriceps. In this way, relaxation of the hamstring is coupled to contraction of the quadriceps. This is a reflex because movement requires no conscious decision.

the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells make them for the peripheral nervous system (PNS). (Both types of glia are discussed in more detail in Section 22.2.) Astrocytes, a third type of glia, provide growth factors and other signals to neurons, and also receive signals from neurons. A fourth type of glia, microglia, constitutes a part of the CNS immune system. While microglia are not related by lineage to neurons or to other glia, they do play important roles in brain development and health. In the next two paragraphs, we describe the function of astrocytes; oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells will be discussed in Section 22.2, and microglia in Section 22.3.

Astrocytes, named for their starlike shape (Figure 22-6), constitute about a third of the brain's mass and up to $40 \%$ of the brain's cells. Astrocytes surround many synapses and dendrites; the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels found

(b) In convergent neural circuits, many different neurons send axonal branches that converge to contact a single target neuron.

FIGURE 22-6 Astrocytes interact with endothelial cells at the blood-brain barrier. Capillaries in the brain are formed by endothelial cells that are interconnected by tight junctions that are impermeable to most molecules. Transport between cells is blocked, so only small molecules that can diffuse across plasma membranes or substances specifically transported through cells can cross the barrier. Certain astrocytes surround the blood vessels, in contact with the endothelial cells, and send secreted protein signals to induce the endothelial cells to produce a selective barrier. The endothelial cells (burgundy) are ensheathed by a layer of basal lamina (orange) and contacted on the outside by astrocyte processes (tan). See N. J. Abbott, L. Rönnbäck, and E. Hansson, 2006, Nature Rev. Neurosci. 7:41-53.
in astrocyte plasma membranes influence the concentration of free ions in the extracellular space, thus affecting the membrane potentials of neurons and of the astrocytes themselves. Astrocytes produce abundant extracellular matrix proteins, some of which are used as guidance cues by migrating neurons, and a host of growth factors
that carry a variety of types of information to neurons. They also release several factors that are necessary for proper synapse formation between neurons, as discussed in Section 22.3. Astrocytes are joined to each other by gap junctions (see Figure 20-21 for structure of gap junctions), so changes in ionic composition in a given astrocyte are communicated to adjacent astrocytes, over distances of hundreds of microns.

Some astrocytes are also critical regulators of the formation of the blood-brain barrier, the purpose of which is to control what types of molecules can travel out of the bloodstream into the brain and vice versa (see Figure 22-6). Blood vessels in the brain supply oxygen and remove $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, and deliver glucose and amino acids, with capillaries found within a few micrometers of every cell. These capillaries form the blood-brain barrier, which allows passage of oxygen and $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ across the endothelial cell wall but prevents, for example, blood-borne circulating neurotransmitters and some drugs from entering the brain. The barrier consists of a set of tight junctions (Chapter 20) that interconnect the endothelial cells that form the walls of capillaries. Surrounding astrocytes promote specialization of these endothelial cells, making them less permeable than those in capillaries found in the rest of the body.

## Neural Stem Cells Form Nerve and Glial Cells in the Central Nervous System

The great interest in the formation of the nervous system and in finding better ways to prevent or treat neurodegenerative diseases through cell replacement therapies has made the characterization of neural stem cells, and their differentiation into mature neurons and glia, an important goal. Much of what we understand about neural and glial stem cells comes from studies of embryonic brain development. The earliest stages of vertebrate neural development involve the rolling up of a tube of ectoderm (the cell layer that lines the outside of the embryo) that extends the length of the embryo from head to tail (Figure 22-7a). This neural tube will form the brain and spinal cord. Initially the thickness of the tube is a single layer of cells, and these cells, referred to as neuroepithelial cells, serve as the embryonic neural stem cells (NSCs) that will give rise to the entire central nervous system. The inside of the neural tube will expand in the forebrain to form the fluid-filled compartments called ventricles, and the cellular layer lining the neural tube, where most cell division takes place, is called the ventricular zone (VZ).

Labeling and tracing experiments in mouse have been done to determine how cells are born and where they go after birth. The embryonic neuroepithelial cells (NECs), the neural stem and progenitor cells that line the ventricle, can divide symmetrically, producing two daughter stem or progenitor cells side by side (Figure 22-7b), thereby expanding the progenitor population. Around the same time that neuron production begins, the NECs transform into radial glial cells, which are the primary precursor cells during embryonic neurogenesis. Radial glial cells

FIGURE 22-7 Formation of the neural tube and division of neural stem cells. (a) Early in vertebrate development a part of the ectoderm rolls up and separates from the rest of the cells. This forms the epidermis (gray) and the neural tube (blue). Near the interface between the two, neural crest cells form and then migrate to contribute to skin pigmentation, nerve formation, craniofacial skeleton, heart valves, peripheral neurons, and other structures. The notochord, a rod of mesoderm for which chordates are named, provides signals that affect cell fates in the neural tube. The interior of the neural tube will become a fluid-filled series of chambers called ventricles. Neural stem cells located adjacent to the ventricles, described as being in the ventricular zone (VZ), will divide to form neurons that migrate radially outward to form the layers of the nervous system. (b) Early in development, in the neuroepithelium (NE), neuroepithelial cells divide symmetrically to generate more neuroepithelial cells. Some are also thought to generate early neurons. As development
progresses and the brain epithelium thickens, neuroepithelial cells convert into radial glial cells (RGCs). RGCs divide symmetrically or asymmetrically to generate neurons or intermediate progenitor cells (IPCs), which in turn generate neurons. RGCs continue to elongate, and send an apical process down to the VZ and a basal process up to contact the meninges. Near the end of embryonic development, RGCs detach from the NE and convert into astrocytes, and also generate oligodendrocytes from IPCs. After birth, in neonates, RGCs continue to divide into neurons and oligodendrocytes, through IPCs. Others convert into ependymal cells or into adult SVZ astrocytes called type B cells that function as neural stem or progenitor cells in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the adult brain. IPC, intermediate progenitor cell; MA, mantle; MZ, marginal zone; NE, neuroepithelium; RG, radial glia; SVZ, subventricular zone; VZ, ventricular zone. See A. Kriegstein and A. Alvarez-Buylla, 2009, Annu. Rev Neurosci. 32:149-184.
also divide symmetrically into two daughter radial glial cells or asymmetrically, into either another radial glial cell and a differentiated neuron, or a radial glial cell and an intermediate progenitor cell. The intermediate precursor cells move into a region just adjacent to the VZ called the subventricular zone (SVZ), and they in turn give rise to differentiated neurons. Newborn neurons use the radial glia as scaffolds as they migrate away from the VZ toward the surface of the brain, migrating radially outward. In the cerebral cortex, the migrating neurons form successive layers in an inside-out fashion. Later in development, RGCs also give rise to glia, including both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes (Figure 22-7b).

For many years it was believed that no new nerve cells are formed in the adult. Most mammalian brain cells indeed stop dividing by adulthood, but some cells in the lateral ventricle, in a region called the adult SVZ, and in a region of the hippocampus continue to act as stem cells to generate new neurons (Figure 22-8a). Similar to other
types of stem cells, these neural stem cells are functionally defined by their ability to self-renew and differentiate into neural lineages, including neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes (Figure 22-8b). To identify and characterize neural stem cells, cells isolated from the SVZ were cultured with growth factors such as FGF2 or EGF. Some of the cells survived and proliferated in an undifferentiated state; that is, they could self-renew. In the presence of other growth factors, these undifferentiated cells gave rise to neurons, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes. The successful establishment of self-renewing and multipotent cells from the adult brain provides strong evidence for the presence of nerve stem-cell populations. While the function of these new neurons in the adult brain is not yet understood, studies in rodents have shown that their survival is increased by enriched environments and by exercise (Figure 22-8c).

Some of the NSCs in the SVZ have properties of astrocytes, such as producing glial fibrillary acidic protein

FIGURE 22-8 Neurogenesis in the adult brain. (a) New neurons are born in two regions of the adult brain, the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus and the subventricular zone (SVZ). Neurons derived from neural stem cells in the SVZ migrate to the olfactory bulb (OB) via the rostral medial stream (RMS) in mice. (b) Neural stem and precursor cells (NPSCs) can be activated to divide into a class of intermediate precursor cells called transit-amplifying cells, which in turn can divide into astrocytes or neurons in the DG or into astrocytes, neurons, or oligodendrocytes in the SVZ. (c) Newly born neurons in the dentate gyrus were labeled with a retrovirus that expresses GFP. Shown are sections of the dentate gyrus from control mice and from mice that
(GFAP). But these NSCs can divide asymmetrically to reproduce themselves and to produce intermediate precursor cells called transit-amplifying cells that in turn divide to form neural precursors (neuroblasts). The SVZ niche is created by mostly unknown signals from the ependymal cells that form a layer lining the ventricle, and by endothelial cells that form blood vessels in the vicinity (see Figure 22-8c). The endothelial cells, and the basal lamina they form, are in direct contact with precursor and stem cells and are believed to be essential in forming the neural stem cell niche. Each neural stem cell extends a single cilium through the ependymal cell layer to directly contact the ventricle. The signals that create the niche are not completely characterized, but there is evidence for a blend of factors, including FGFs, BMPs, IGF, VEGF, TGF $\alpha$, and BDNF (see Chapter 16 for descriptions of these signaling pathways). The BMPs appear to favor astrocyte differentiation over neural differentiation, one example of cell fate determination control that must remain in proper balance. were allowed to exercise on a running wheel in their cages for a week. The newly born neurons are green, and the extensive dendritic branches they have developed indicate that they have survived and have become incorporated into the hippocampus. All the other cells in the hippocampus are labeled with a red nuclear marker. The dense red labeling in the dentate gyrus (the sideways V-shaped structure) are the cell bodies of the granule cells. The other red cell bodies represent glial cells and inhibitory neurons. As this image illustrates, the percentage of granule cells in the dentate gyrus that are newly born is very small, and is significantly increased by running. [Part (c) Chunmei Zhao and Fred H. Gage.]

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 22.1

## Neurons and Glia: Building Blocks of the Nervous System

- Neurons are highly asymmetric cells composed of multiple dendrites at one end, a cell body containing the nucleus, a long axon, and axon termini.
- Neurons carry information from one end to the other using pulses of ion flow across the plasma membrane. Branched cell processes, dendrites, at one end of the cell receive chemical signals from other neurons, triggering ion flow. The electrical signal moves rapidly to axon termini at the other end of the cell (see Figure 22-1).
- A resting neuron carrying no signal has ATP-powered pumps that move ions across the plasma membrane. The outward movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions creates a net negative charge

inside the cell. This voltage is called the resting potential and usually is about -70 mV (see Figure 22-2).

- If a stimulus causes certain ion channels to open so that certain ions can flow more freely, a strong pulse of voltage change may pass down the neuron from dendrites to axon termini. The cell goes from being $\sim-70 \mathrm{mV}$ inside to $\sim+50 \mathrm{mV}$ inside, relative to the extracellular fluid. This pulse is called an action potential (see Figure 22-2).
- The action potential travels down the length of the axon from the cell body to the axon termini at speeds of up to 100 meters per second.
- Neurons connect across small spaces called synapses. Since an action potential cannot jump the gap, at the axon termini of the presynaptic cell the signal is converted from electrical to chemical to stimulate the postsynaptic cell.
- Upon stimulation by an action potential, axon termini release, by exocytosis, small packets of chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the dendrites on the other side of the synapse. These receptors can induce or inhibit a new axon potential in the postsynaptic cell (see Figure 22-3).
- Neurons form circuits that usually consist of sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons, as in the knee-jerk response (see Figure 22-4).
- Glial cells are abundant in the nervous system and serve many purposes. Oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells build the myelin insulation that coats many neurons.
- Neurons connect with one another to form circuits. Three fundamental patterns of neuronal connectivity include divergent, convergent, and feedback circuits.
- Astrocytes, another type of glial cell, wrap their processes around synapses and blood vessels and promote formation of the blood-brain barrier (see Figure 22-6). Astrocytes also secrete proteins that stimulate synapse formation and participate in the formation and function of neural circuits.
- Embryonic neural stem cells in the ventricular zone give rise to all cells in the central nervous system. These stem and progenitor cells undergo a series of symmetric and asymmetric cells to produce more progenitor cells, glia, and neurons (Figure 22-7).
- In the adult brain, new neurons are born in the subventricular zone and in the dentate gyrus region of the hippocampus (Figure 22-8). The differentiation of stem and progenitor cells is regulated by a variety of signaling factors.


### 22.2 Voltage-Gated Ion Channels and the Propagation of Action Potentials

In Chapter 11 we learned that an electric potential of $\sim 70 \mathrm{mV}$ (cytosolic face negative) exists across the plasma membrane of all cells, including resting nerve cells. This resting
membrane potential is generated by outward movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions through open nongated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the plasma membrane, and is driven by the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration gradient (cytosol $>$ extracellular medium). The high cytosolic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and low cytosolic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations, relative to their concentrations in the extracellular medium, are generated by the plasma membrane $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pump, which uses the energy released by hydrolysis of phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP to pump $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$outward and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$inward. The entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions into the cytosol from the medium is thermodynamically favored, driven both by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration gradient (extracellular medium $>$ cytosol) and the inside-negative membrane potential (see Figure 11-25). However, most $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the plasma membrane are closed in resting cells, so little inward movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions can occur (Figure 22-9a).

During an action potential, some of these $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels open, allowing inward movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, which depolarizes the membrane. Action potentials are propagated down the axon because a change in voltage in one part of the axon triggers the opening of channels in the next section of the axon. Such voltage-gated channels therefore lie at the heart of neural transmission. In this section, we first introduce some of the key properties of action potentials, which move rapidly along the axon from the cell body to the termini. We then describe how the voltage-gated channels responsible for propagating action potentials in neurons operate. In the last part of the section, we will see how the myelin sheath, produced by glial cells, increases the speed and efficiency of electrical transmission in nerve cells.

## The Magnitude of the Action Potential Is Close to $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and Is Caused by $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Influx Through Open $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels

Figure 22-9b illustrates how the membrane potential will change if enough $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the plasma membrane open. The resulting influx of positively charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions into the cytosol will more than compensate for the efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions through open resting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The result will be a net inward movement of cations, generating an excess of positive charges on the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane and a corresponding excess of negative charges on the extracellular face (owing to the $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions "left behind" in the extracellular medium after influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions). In other words, the plasma membrane becomes depolarized to such an extent that the inside face becomes positive with respect to the external face.

Recall from Chapter 11 that the equilibrium potential of an ion is the membrane potential at which there is no net flow of that ion from one side of the membrane to the other due to the balancing of two opposing forces, the ion concentration gradient and the membrane potential. At the peak of depolarization in an action potential, the magnitude of the membrane potential is very close to the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$equilibrium potential $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$ given by the Nernst equation (Equation 11-2), as would be expected if opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels

(b) Depolarized state (cytosolic face positive)
![li12835345559](li12835345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-9 Depolarization of the plasma membrane due to opening of gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. (a) In resting neurons, a type of nongated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is open part of the time, but the more numerous gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are closed. The movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions outward establishes the inside-negative membrane potential characteristic of most cells. (b) Opening of gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels permits an influx of sufficient $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to cause a reversal of the membrane potential. In the depolarized state, voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open and subsequently repolarize the membrane. Note that the flows of ions are too small to have much effect on the overall concentration of either $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$in the cytosol or exterior fluid.
is responsible for generating action potentials. For example, the measured peak value of the action potential for the squid giant axon is +35 mV , which is close to the calculated value of $E_{\mathrm{Na}}(+55 \mathrm{mV})$ based on $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations of 440 mM outside and 50 mM inside. The relationship between the magnitude of the action potential and the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions inside and outside the cell has been confirmed experimentally. For instance, if the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions in the solution bathing the squid axon is reduced to one-third of normal, the magnitude of the depolarization is reduced by 40 mV , nearly as predicted.

## Sequential Opening and Closing of VoltageGated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Channels Generate Action Potentials

The cycle of changes in membrane potential and return to the resting value that constitutes an action potential lasts $1-2$ milliseconds and can occur hundreds of times a second in a typical neuron (see Figure 22-2). These cyclical changes in the membrane potential result first from the opening and closing of a number of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels (that is, channels opened by a change in membrane potential) in a
segment of the axonal plasma membrane, and then from the opening and closing of voltage-gated $K^{+}$channels. The role of these channels in the generation of action potentials was elucidated in classic studies done on the giant axon of the squid, in which multiple microelectrodes can be inserted without causing damage to the integrity of the plasma membrane. However, the same basic mechanism is used by all neurons.

Voltage-Gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$Channels As just discussed, voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are closed in resting neurons. A small depolarization of the membrane (as occurs when neurotransmitter stimulates a postsynaptic cell) increases the likelihood that any one channel will open; the greater the depolarization, the greater the probability that a channel will open. Depolarization causes a conformational change in these channel proteins that opens a gate on the cytosolic surface of the pore, permitting $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to pass through the pore into the cell. Thus the greater the initial membrane depolarization, the more voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels that open and the more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions that enter.

As $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions flow inward through opened channels, the excess positive charges on the cytosolic face and negative charges on the exoplasmic face diffuse a short distance away from the initial site of depolarization. This passive spread of positive charges on the cytosolic face and negative charges on the external face depolarizes (makes the inside less negative) adjacent segments of the plasma membrane, causing opening of additional voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in these segments and an increase in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx. As more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions enter the cell, the inside of the cell membrane becomes more depolarized, causing the opening of yet more voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and even more membrane depolarization, setting into motion an explosive entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions. For a fraction of a millisecond, the permeability of this small segment of the membrane to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$becomes vastly greater than that for $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, and the membrane potential approaches $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$, the equilibrium potential for a membrane permeable only to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions. As the membrane potential approaches $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$, however, further net inward movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions ceases, since the concentration gradient of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions (outside $>$ inside) is now offset by the inside-positive membrane potential. The action potential is, at its peak, close to the value of $E_{\mathrm{Na}}$.

Figure 22-10 schematically depicts the critical structural features of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and the conformational changes that cause their opening and closing. In the resting state, a segment of the protein on the cytosolic face-the gate-obstructs the central pore, preventing passage of ions. The channel contains four positively charged voltage-sensing $\alpha$ helices; in the resting state these helices are attracted to the inside-negative surface of the plasma membrane. A small depolarization of the membrane triggers movement of these voltage-sensing helices toward the negative charges that are building up on the exoplasmic surface, causing a conformational change in the gate that opens the channel and allows $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion flow. After about 1 ms , further $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx is prevented by movement of the cytosol-facing

Repolarization of membrane, return of voltage-sensing $\alpha$ helices to resting position, displacement of channel-inactivating segment, and closure of gate (slow, several ms)
![li12935345559](li12935345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-10 Operational model of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel. As in the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel depicted in Figure 11-20, four transmembrane domains in the protein contribute to the central pore through which ions move. The critical components that control movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are shown here in the cutaway views depicting three of the four transmembrane domains. In the closed, resting state, the voltagesensing $\alpha$ helices, which have positively charged side chains every third residue, are attracted to the negative charges on the cytosolic side of the resting membrane. This keeps the gate segment near the cytosolic face in a "closed" position that blocks the channel, preventing entry of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). In response to a small depolarization,
the voltage-sensing helices move through the phospholipid bilayer toward the outer membrane surface, causing an immediate conformational change in the gate at the cytosolic face of the protein that opens the channel (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Within a fraction of a millisecond the channel-inactivating segment moves into the open channel, preventing passage of further ions (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Once the membrane is repolarized, the voltage-sensing helices return to the resting position, the channel-inactivating segment is displaced from the channel opening, and the gate closes; the protein reverts to the closed, resting state and can be opened again by depolarization (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). See W. A. Catterall, 2001, Nature 409:988; and S. B. Long et al., 2007, Nature 450:376.
channel-inactivating segment into the open channel, blocking any further movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions. As long as the membrane remains depolarized, the channel-inactivating segment remains in the channel opening; during this refractory period, the channel is inactivated and cannot be reopened. A few milliseconds after the inside-negative resting potential is reestablished, the channel-inactivating segment swings away from the pore and the voltage-sensing $\alpha$ helices return to their resting position near the cytosolic surface of the membrane. Thus the channel returns to the closed resting state, once again able to be opened by depolarization. Note the important distinction between "closed" channels and those that are "inactive" as depicted in Figure 22-10.

Voltage-Gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$Channels The repolarization of the membrane that occurs during the refractory period is due largely to opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The subsequent increased efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the cytosol removes the excess positive charges from the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane (i.e., makes it more negative), thereby restoring the inside-negative resting potential. For a brief instant, the membrane actually becomes hyperpolarized; at the peak of this hyperpolarization, the potential approaches $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, which
is more negative than the resting potential (see Figure 22-2).
Opening of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels is induced by the large depolarization of the action potential. Unlike voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, most types of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels remain open as long as the membrane is depolarized, and close only when the membrane potential has returned to an inside-negative value. Because the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels open slightly after the initial depolarization, at the height of the action potential, they sometimes are called delayed $K^{+}$ channels. Eventually all the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels return to their closed resting states. The only open channels in this baseline condition are the nongated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels that generate the resting membrane potential, which soon returns to its usual value of -60 to -70 mV (see Figure 22-9a).

While the flow of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions alters membrane potential dramatically as it is depolarized, hyperpolarized, and repolarized during an action potential cycle, it is important to note that the exchange of these ions across the membrane is small compared to the overall numbers of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions in the cytosol and extracellular space. Thus the conduction of action potentials in neurons does not directly require the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps that maintain their ion concentration gradients, as we will see shortly.

Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are difficult to study using patch-clamp techniques, but the patch-clamp tracings in Figure 22-11 reveal the essential properties of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels (see Figure 11-22 for a description of patch clamping). In this experiment, small segments of a neuronal plasma membrane were held clamped at different voltages, and the flux of electric charges through the patch due to flow of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions through open $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels was measured. At the modest depolarizing voltage of -10 mV , the channels in the membrane patch open infrequently and remain open for only a few milliseconds, as judged, respectively, by the number and width of the upward blips on the tracings. Further, the ion flux through them is rather small, as measured by the electric current passing through each open channel (the height of the blips). Depolarizing the membrane further to +20 mV causes these channels to open about twice as frequently; also, more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions move through each open channel (the height of the blips is greater) because the force driving cytosolic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions outward is greater at a membrane potential of +20 mV than at -10 mV . Depolarizing the membrane further to +50 mV , the value at the peak of an action potential, causes opening of more $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and also increases the flux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$through them. Thus by opening during the peak of the action potential, these $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels permit the outward movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions and repolarization of the membrane potential while the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are being closed and inactivated.

More than 100 voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel proteins have been identified in humans and other vertebrates. As we discuss later, all these channel proteins have a similar overall structure, but they exhibit different voltage dependencies, conductivities, channel kinetics, and other functional properties. Many open only at strongly depolarizing voltages, a property required for generation of the maximal depolarization characteristic of the action potential before repolarization of the membrane begins.

3
Given the fundamental role voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels play in determining action potential firing, it is not surprising that mutations in these channels give rise to
inherited, monogenic human epilepsies. Epilepsies are seizure disorders that affect about $1 \%$ of the population and that result from excessive synchronized neuronal activity in the brain. While epilepsy can arise from a variety of causes, including abnormal brain development, brain injury, and drug and alcohol abuse, some forms of epilepsy are caused by mutations in genes that encode ion channels. These diseases are called channelopathies. Human genetic studies have identified specific mutations in the Nav1.1 voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel that cause generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures, while mutations in the Kv7.2 and Kv7.3 voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels cause another form of epilepsy called benign familial neonatal convulsions. Mutations in voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels cause neuronal hyperexcitability in a variety of ways, including by altering $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel inactivation or blocking $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel-dependent repolarization of neurons, both of which prolong the duration of action potentials, or by lowering the threshold for triggering action potentials, for example, by decreasing the ratio of inhibitory to excitatory inputs onto neurons.

## Action Potentials Are Propagated Unidirectionally Without Diminution

An action potential begins with changes that occur in a small patch of the axonal plasma membrane near the cell body. At the peak of the action potential, passive spread of the membrane depolarization is sufficient to depolarize a neighboring segment of membrane. This causes a few voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in this region to open, thereby increasing the extent of depolarization in the region and causing an explosive opening of more $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and generation of an action potential. This depolarization soon triggers opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and restoration of the resting potential. The action potential thus spreads as a traveling wave away from its initial site without diminution.

As noted earlier, during the refractory period voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are inactivated for several milliseconds. Such refractory channels cannot conduct ion movements
![li13035345559](li13035345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 22-11 Probability of channel opening and current flux through individual voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels increases with the extent of membrane depolarization. These patch-clamp tracings were obtained from patches of neuronal plasma membrane clamped at three different potentials, $+50,+20$, and -10 mV . The upward deviations in the current indicate the opening of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and movement of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions outward (cytosolic to
exoplasmic face) across the membrane. Increasing the membrane depolarization (i.e., the clamping voltage) from -10 mV to +50 mV increases the probability a channel will open, the time it stays open, and the amount of electric current (numbers of ions) that passes through it. $\mathrm{pA} \equiv$ picoamperes.

and cannot open during this period even if the membrane is depolarized owing to passive spread. As illustrated in Figure 22-12, the inability of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels to reopen during the refractory period ensures that action potentials are propagated only in one direction, from the initial axon segment where they originate to the axon termini. Because the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels upstream of the location of the action potential
are still inactivated they cannot be reopened by the small depolarization caused by passive spread. In contrast, the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels "downstream" of the action potential begin to open.

The refractory period of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels also limits the number of action potentials that a neuron can conduct per second. This is important, since it is the frequency of action

FIGURE 22-12 Unidirectional conduction of an action potential due to transient inactivation of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. At time 0 , an action potential (pink line) is at the $2-\mathrm{mm}$ position on the axon; the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels at this position are open (green shading), and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions are flowing inward. The excess $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions diffuse in both directions along the inside of the membrane, passively spreading the depolarization in both directions (curved pink arrows). But because the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels at the $1-\mathrm{mm}$ position are still inactivated (red shading),
they cannot yet be reopened by the small depolarization caused by passive spread; the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels at the "downstream" 3-mm position, in contrast, begin to open. Each region of the membrane is refractory (inactive) for a few milliseconds after an action potential has passed. Thus the depolarization at the 2-mm site at time 0 triggers action potentials downstream only; at 1 ms an action potential is passing the $3-\mathrm{mm}$ position, and at 2 ms an action potential is passing the $4-\mathrm{mm}$ position.

potentials that carries the information. Reopening of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels upstream of an action potential (i.e., closer to the cell body) also is delayed by the membrane hyperpolarization that results from opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels.

## Nerve Cells Can Conduct Many Action Potentials in the Absence of ATP

The depolarization of the membrane during an action potential results from movement of just a small number of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions into a neuron and does not significantly affect the intracellular $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentration. A typical nerve cell has about 10 voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels per square micrometer $\left(\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ of plasma membrane. Since each channel passes about $5000-10,000$ ions during the millisecond it is open (see Figure 11-23), a maximum of $10^{5}$ ions per $\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ of plasma membrane will move inward during each action potential.

To assess the effect of this ion flux on the cytosolic $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ concentration of $10 \mathrm{mM}(0.01 \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L})$ typical of a resting axon, we focus on a segment of axon 10 micrometers ( $\mu \mathrm{m}$ ) long and $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. The volume of this segment is $78 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{3}$, or $7.8 \times 10^{-13}$ liters, and it contains $4.7 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ions: $\left(10^{-2} \mathrm{~mol} / \mathrm{L}\right)\left(7.8 \times 10^{-13} \mathrm{~L}\right)\left(6 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{mol}\right)$. The surface area of this segment of the axon is $31 \mu \mathrm{~m}^{2}$, and during passage of one action potential, $10^{5} \mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions will enter per $\mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$ of membrane. Thus this $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx increases the number of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in this segment by only one part in about 1500: $\left(4.7 \times 10^{9}\right) /\left(3.1 \times 10^{6}\right)$. Likewise, the repolarization of the membrane due to the efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions through voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels does not significantly change the intracellular $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration.

## All Voltage-Gated Ion Channels Have Similar Structures

Having explained how the action potential is dependent on regulated opening and closing of voltage-gated channels, we turn to a molecular dissection of these remarkable proteins. After describing the basic structure of these channels, we focus on three questions:

- How do these proteins sense changes in membrane potential?
- How is this change transduced into opening of the channel?
- What causes these channels to become inactivated shortly after opening?

The initial breakthrough in understanding voltage-gated ion channels came from analysis of fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster) carrying the shaker mutation. These flies shake vigorously under ether anesthesia, reflecting a loss of motor control and a defect in certain motor neurons that have an abnormally prolonged action potential. Researchers suspected that the shaker mutation caused a defect in channel function. Cloning of the gene involved confirmed that the defective protein was a voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. The shaker mutation prevents the mutant channel from opening
normally immediately upon depolarization. To establish that the wild-type shaker gene encoded a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, cloned wildtype shaker cDNA was used as a template to produce shaker mRNA in a cell-free system. Expression of this mRNA in frog oocytes and patch-clamp measurements on the newly synthesized channel protein showed that its functional properties were identical with those of the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in the neuronal membrane, demonstrating conclusively that the shaker gene encodes this $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-channel protein.

The Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and most other voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels that have been identified are tetrameric proteins composed of four identical subunits arranged in the membrane around a central pore. Each subunit is constructed of six membrane-spanning $\alpha$ helices, designated S1-S6, and a P segment (Figure 22-13a). The S5 and S6 helices and the P segment are structurally and functionally homologous to those in the nongated resting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel discussed earlier (see Figure 11-20); the S5 and S6 helices form the lining of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$selectivity filter through which the ion travels. The S1-S4 helices form a rigid complex that functions as a voltage sensor (with positively charged side chains in S4 acting as the primary sensor). The N-terminal "ball" extending into the cytosol from S 1 is the channel-inactivating segment.

Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are monomeric proteins organized into four homologous domains, I-IV (Figure 22-13b). Each of these domains is similar to a subunit of a voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. However, in contrast to volt-age-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, which have four channel-inactivating segments, the monomeric voltage-gated channels have a single channel-inactivating segment. Except for this minor structural difference and their varying ion permeabilities, all voltage-gated ion channels are thought to function in a similar manner and to have evolved from a monomeric ancestral channel protein that contained six transmembrane $\alpha$ helices. The next section will focus on the voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, since the crystal structures of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels were solved over a decade ago, with subsequent studies refining our understanding of the structural basis of their function. We will also, however, compare and contrast this structure with that of prokaryotic voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, whose molecular structure was solved in 2011.

## Voltage-Sensing S4 $\alpha$ Helices Move in Response to Membrane Depolarization

Our understanding of channel-protein biochemistry is advancing rapidly owing to newly obtained crystal structures for bacterial and Shaker potassium channels and other channels. Transmembrane proteins are notoriously difficult to produce and crystallize, posing unique challenges for the scientist. One method used to obtain crystals of these difficult membrane proteins was to surround them with bound fragments of monoclonal antibodies [F(ab)'s; Chapter 23]; in other cases they were crystallized in complexes with normal protein-binding partners. In both cases the presence of these water-soluble proteins in the complex somehow enhanced crystal formation.

FIGURE 22-13 Schematic depictions of the secondary structures of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels. (a) Voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ channels are composed of four identical subunits, each containing 600-700 amino acids, and six membrane-spanning $\alpha$ helices, S1-S6. The N -terminus of each subunit, located in the cytosol and labeled N , forms a globular domain (orange ball) essential for inactivation of the open channel. The S5 and S6 helices (green) and the P segment (blue) are homologous to those in nongated resting $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, but each subunit contains four additional transmembrane $\alpha$ helices. One of these, S4 (red), is the primary voltage-sensing $\alpha$ helix and is assisted
in this role by forming a stable complex with helices S1-S3. See C. Miller, 1992, Curr. Biol. 2:573, and H. Larsson et al., 1996, Neuron 16:387. (b) Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are monomers containing 1800-2000 amino acids organized into four transmembrane domains (I-IV) that are similar to the subunits in voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. The single hydrophobic channel-inactivating segment (orange ball) is located in the cytosol between domains III and IV. Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels have a similar overall structure. Most voltage-gated ion channels also contain regulatory ( $\beta$ ) subunits, which are not depicted here. See W. A. Catterall, 2001, Nature 409:988.

The structures of the channels reveal remarkable arrangements of the voltage-sensing domains, and suggest how parts of the protein move in order to open the channel. As already noted, the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$-channel tetramer, like the $\mathrm{Na}+$ channel monomer, has a pore whose walls are formed by helices S5 and S6 (Figure 22-13a and Figure 22-14). Outside that core structure four arms, or "paddles," each containing helices S1-S4, protrude into the surrounding membrane and also interact with the outer sides of the S5 and S6 helices; these are the voltage sensors, and they are in minimal contact with the pore. Sensitive electrical measurements suggested that the opening of a voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel is accompanied by the movement of 12 to 14 protein-bound positive charges from the cytosolic to the exoplasmic surface of the membrane. The moving parts of the protein are the rigid complexes composed of helices S1-S4; S4 accounts for much of the positive charge and is the primary voltage sensor, with a positively charged lysine or arginine every third or fourth residue (Figure 22-14d). Arginines in S4 have
been measured moving as much as 1.5 nm as the channel opens, which can be compared with the $\sim 5-\mathrm{nm}$ thickness of the membrane or the $1.2-\mathrm{nm}$ diameter of the $\alpha$ helix itself.

In the resting state, the positive charges on the S1-S4 complexes (the "paddles") are attracted to the negative charges on the cytosolic face of the membrane. In the depolarized membrane, these same positive charges become attracted to the negative charges on the exoplasmic (outer) surface of the membrane, causing the S1-S4 paddles to move partly across the membrane-from the cytosolic to the exoplasmic surface. This movement is depicted schematically for the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel in Figure 22-10 and triggers a conformational change in the protein that opens the channel.

The most unusual aspect of the voltage-sensitive channel structures is the presence of charged groups, for example, arginines, in contact with lipid. The location of the voltage sensor helps to explain earlier experiments in which a non-voltage-sensitive channel was converted into a voltagesensing channel by adding voltage-sensing domains. Such a

FIGURE 22-14 Molecular structure of a voltage-sensitive $K^{+}$channel. Models of the potassium channel single subunit (a) and tetramer (b) as viewed from the side, in open and closed states. The four green (S5) and blue (S6) $\alpha$ helices span the membrane, with the interior of the cell at the bottom and exterior at the top. Note how the helices are tightly packed at the bottom in the closed conformation, so that the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion cannot pass through. (Compare the distances between S5 helices as shown by the curly brackets below (a) and (b).) The S4-S5 linker (orange), located in the cytoplasm, connects the S4 helix (not shown) to the S5 helix. For clarity, helices S1 through S4 have been omitted from the model; they would normally be attached to the end of the S4-S5 linker and protrude from the molecule. (c) Ribbon diagrams of the open and closed states of the channel as viewed from the cytoplasmic face of the membrane.

In the open, but not in the closed, state, potassium ions (dark purple) can pass through the pore. (d) Three-dimensional structure of the voltage-sensing "paddles" comprising helixes S1-S4, with the four voltage-sensing arginine (R) residues in S4. These paddles move from near the interior to the exterior of the membrane in response to depolarization. Since each one is attached to an S4-S5 linker, each linker and its attached S5 helix is moved, in turn moving S6 helices, which opens the pore. Note that as shown in (b), the linker between S4 and S5 is pointed upward toward the exoplasmic (exterior) surface in the open channel, pulled upward by the outward movement of the S1-S4 paddles; in contrast the S4-S5 linker is pointing downward in the closed channel when the S1-S4 paddles are nearer the cytosolic surface. [Data from X. Chen et al., 2010, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 107:11352, PDB ID 3lut; and Y. Zhou, et al., 2001, Nature 414:43-48, PDB ID based on 1k4c.]

result would seem unlikely if the voltage sensors had to be deeply embedded in the core structure.

Studies with mutant Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels support the importance of the S 4 helix in voltage sensing. When one or more arginine or lysine residues in the S 4 helix of the Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel were replaced with neutral or acidic residues, fewer positive charges than normal moved across the membrane in response to a membrane depolarization, indicating that arginine and lysine residues in the S 4 helix do indeed move across the membrane. The structure of the open form of a mammalian voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel has been contrasted with the closed structure of a different $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel. The results suggest a model for the opening and closing of the channel in response to movements of the voltage sensors across the membrane (see Figure 22-14a, b). In the model, the voltage sensors, composed of helices S1-S4, move in response to voltage and exert a torque on a linker helix that connects S4 to S5:

- In the open-channel conformation, the position of the S4-S5 linker forces the S6 helix to form a kink near the cytosolic surface (blue in Figure 22-14a) and the pore inside, near the cytosolic surface, is open. The pore's $1.2-\mathrm{nm}$ diameter is sufficient to accommodate hydrated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions (see Figure 22-14c).
- When the cell membrane is repolarized and the voltage sensor moves toward the cytosolic membrane surface, the S4-S5 linkers (orange in Figure 22-14b) are twisted down, toward the inside of the cell. The S6 helices are consequently straightened, squeezing the bottom of the channel closed. Thus the gate is composed of the cytosol-facing ends of the S5 and S6 helices, where the pore is narrowest.

Although voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels share similar voltage sensor and pore structures, the structure of their ion selectivity filters and the way that they conduct ions differ significantly (as also discussed in Chapter 11). The selectivity filter of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel is much larger than that of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel, even though the diameter of a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion $(0.102 \mathrm{~nm})$ is smaller than that of a $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion $(0.138 \mathrm{~nm})$. The pore of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels contains conserved amino acids that form a lining of carbonyl oxygen atoms (see Figure 11-21). As $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions enter the pore, these oxygen atoms replace its waters of hydration; the smaller $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions would be too small to interact with the backbone carbonyls of the $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel pore. In contrast, $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions pass through the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel pore as water-hydrated ions. The pore of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel is lined by conserved negatively charged amino acids and is large enough to fit a single, water-hydrated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion, with the positively charged $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion interacting with the negatively charged pore residues through its inner shell of bound water molecules. The hydrated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ion is too large to fit through this pore.

The topical anesthesia lidocaine, which is commonly used to reduce pain during dental procedures or during minor surgeries (e.g., to suture cuts), works by blocking the flow of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions through the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel. Lidocaine binds to amino acid residues that line the channel pore and prevent the influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and thus the generation of an action potential. The binding sites for lidocaine are
only available in the open state of the channel, and binding of lidocaine appears to lock the channel in the open but occluded state.

## Movement of the Channel-Inactivating Segment into the Open Pore Blocks Ion Flow

An important characteristic of most voltage-gated channels is inactivation; that is, soon after opening they close spontaneously, forming an inactive channel that will not reopen until the membrane is repolarized. In the resting state, the globular balls at the N -termini of the four subunits in a voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel are free in the cytosol (see Figure 22-13). Several milliseconds after the channel is opened by depolarization, one ball moves through an opening between two of the subunits and binds in a hydrophobic pocket in the pore's central cavity, blocking the flow of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions (see Figure 22-10). After a few milliseconds, the ball is displaced from the pore, and the protein reverts to the closed, resting state. The ball-andchain domains in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are functionally equivalent to the channel-inactivating segment in $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels.

The experimental results shown in Figure 22-15 demonstrate that inactivation of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels depends on the ball domains, occurs after channel opening, and does not require the ball domains to be covalently linked to the channel protein. In other experiments, mutant $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels lacking portions of the $\sim 40$-residue chain connecting the ball to the S 1 helix were expressed in frog oocytes. Patch clamp measurements of channel activity showed that the shorter the chain, the more rapid the inactivation, as if a ball attached to a shorter chain can move into the open channel more readily.
![li13435345559](li13435345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 22-15 Experiments with a mutant $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel lacking the N -terminal globular domains support the ball-and-chain inactivation model. The wild-type Shaker $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel and a mutant form lacking the amino acids composing the N -terminal ball were expressed in Xenopus oocytes. The activity of the channels was monitored by the patch-clamp technique. When patches were depolarized from 0 to +30 mV , the wild-type channel opened for $\sim 5 \mathrm{~ms}$ and then closed (red curve). The mutant channel opened normally, but could not close (green curve). When a chemically synthesized ball peptide was added to the cytosolic face of the patch, the mutant channel opened normally and then closed (blue curve). This demonstrated that the added peptide inactivated the channel after it opened and that the ball does not have to be tethered to the protein in order to function. (Data from W. N. Zagotta et al., 1990, Science 250:568.)

Conversely, addition of random amino acids to lengthen the normal chain slows channel inactivation.

The single channel-inactivating segment in voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels contains a conserved hydrophobic motif composed of isoleucine, phenylalanine, methionine, and threonine (see Figure 22-13b). Like the longer ball-and-chain domain in $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels, this segment folds into and blocks the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-conducting pore until the membrane is repolarized.

The technique of molecular dynamics has provided further insights into the structure and function of voltage-gated ion channels. Molecular dynamics involves computer simulations of the physical movement of molecules and atoms in time, basing the simulations on experimental data derived from structural, biochemical, and molecular studies of the molecule of interest. Molecular dynamic studies of a prokaryotic volt-age-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel provide a cinematic view of voltage sensing, pore opening, and gate inactivation.

## Myelination Increases the Velocity of Impulse Conduction

As we have seen, action potentials can move down an unmyelinated axon without diminution at speeds up to 1 meter per second. But even such fast speeds are insufficient to permit the complex movements typical of animals. In adult humans, for instance, the cell bodies of motor neurons innervating leg muscles are located in the spinal cord, and the axons are about a meter in length. The coordinated muscle contractions required for walking, running, and similar movements would be impossible if it took 1 second for an action potential to move from the spinal cord down the axon of a motor neuron to a leg muscle. The solution is to wrap cells in insulation that increases the rate of movement of an action potential. The insulation is called a myelin sheath (see Figure 22-1b). The presence of a myelin sheath around an axon increases the velocity of impulse conduction to 10-100 meters per second. As a result, in a typical human motor neuron, an action potential can travel the length of a 1-meter-long axon and stimulate a muscle to contract within 0.01 seconds.

In nonmyelinated neurons, the conduction velocity of an action potential is roughly proportional to the diameter of the axon, because a thicker axon will have a greater number of ions that can diffuse. The human brain is packed with relatively small, myelinated neurons. If the neurons in the human brain were not myelinated, their axonal diameters would have to increase about 10,000 -fold to achieve the same conduction velocities as myelinated neurons. Thus vertebrate brains, with their densely packed neurons, never could have evolved without myelin.

## Action Potentials "Jump" from Node to Node in Myelinated Axons

The myelin sheath surrounding an axon is formed from many glial cells. Each region of myelin formed by an individual glial cell is separated from the next region by an unmyelinated
area of axonal membrane about $1 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in length called the node of Ranvier (or simply, node; see Figure 22-1b). The axonal membrane is in direct contact with the extracellular fluid only at the nodes, and the myelin covering prevents any ion movement into or out of the axon except at the nodes. Moreover, all the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels and all the $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps, which maintain the ionic gradients in the axon, are located in the nodes.

As a consequence of this localization, the inward movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions that generates the action potential can occur only at the myelin-free nodes (Figure 22-16). The excess cytosolic positive ions generated at a node during the membrane depolarization associated with $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$movement into the cytosol as part of an action potential spread passively through the axonal cytosol to the next node with very little loss or attenuation, since they cannot cross the myelinated axonal membrane. This causes a depolarization at one node to spread rapidly to the next node and induce an action potential there, effectively permitting the action potential to jump from node to node. The transmission is called saltatory conduction. This phenomenon explains why the conduction velocity of myelinated neurons is about the same as that of much-larger-diameter unmyelinated neurons. For instance, a $12-\mu \mathrm{m}$-diameter myelinated vertebrate axon and a $600-\mu \mathrm{m}$-diameter unmyelinated squid axon both conduct impulses at $12 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$.
![li13535345559](li13535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-16 Conduction of action potentials in myelinated axons. Because the myelin layer renders the axon impermeable to ion movement across its membrane and because voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are found only on axonal membrane at the nodes of Ranvier, the influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions associated with an action potential can occur only at nodes. When an action potential is generated at one node (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ), the excess positive ions in the cytosol, which cannot move outward across the sheath, diffuse rapidly down the axon, causing sufficient depolarization at the next node (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ) to induce an action potential at that node (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). By this mechanism the action potential jumps from node to node along the axon.

## Two Types of Glia Produce Myelin Sheaths

Figure 22-17 shows three main types of glial cells present in the nervous system, two of which produce myelin sheaths: oligodendrocytes make sheaths for the central nervous system (CNS), and Schwann cells make them for the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Astrocytes, also shown in the figure, facilitate synapse formation and communication between neurons, and are discussed in Sections 22.1 and 22.3. A fourth type of glia, microglia (not shown), constitutes a part of the CNS immune system. While microglia are not related by lineage to neurons or to other glia, they have recently been shown to play roles in an aspect of neural circuit formation called synaptic pruning, discussed in Section 22.3.

Oligodendrocytes Oligodendrocytes form the spiral myelin sheath around axons of the central nervous system (Figure 22-17a). Each oligodendrocyte provides myelin sheaths to segments of multiple neurons. The major protein constituents are myelin basic protein (MBP) and proteolipid protein (PLP). MBP, a peripheral membrane protein found in both the central and peripheral nervous systems (Figure 22-18), has seven RNA splicing variants that encode different forms of the protein. It is synthesized by ribosomes located in the growing myelin sheath, an example of specific transport of mRNAs to a distal cell region (Chapter 10). MBP mRNA undergoes microtubule-dependent transport to distal oligodendrocyte processes, where its local translation contributes to the formation of the myelin sheath.

FIGURE 22-18 Formation and structure of a myelin sheath in the peripheral nervous system. (a) At high magnification the specialized spiral myelin membrane appears as a series of layers, or lamellae, of phospholipid bilayers wrapped around the axon. (b) Close-up view of three layers of the myelin membrane spiral. The two most abundant integral myelin membrane proteins, $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ and PMP22, are produced only by Schwann cells. The exoplasmic domain of a $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ protein, which has an immunoglobulin fold, associates with similar domains emanating from $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ proteins in the opposite membrane surface, thereby "zippering" together the exoplasmic membrane surfaces
in close apposition. These interactions are stabilized by binding of a tryptophan residue on the tip of the exoplasmic domain to lipids in the opposite membrane. Close apposition of the cytosolic faces of the membrane may result from binding of the cytosolic tail of each $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ protein to phospholipids in the opposite membrane. PMP22 may also contribute to membrane compaction. Myelin basic protein (MBP), a cytosolic protein, remains between the closely apposed membranes as the cytosol is squeezed out. See L. Shapiro et al., 1996, Neuron 17:435, and E. J. Arroyo and S. S. Scherer, 2000, Histochem. Cell Biol. 113:1. [Part (a) ISM/Phototake.]

$\mathbf{S}_{0}$Damage to proteins produced by oligodendrocytes underlies a prevalent human neurological disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is usually characterized by spasms and weakness in one or more limbs, bladder dysfunction, local sensory losses, and visual disturbances. This disorder-the prototype demyelinating disease-is caused by patchy loss of myelin in areas of the brain and spinal cord. In MS patients, conduction of action potentials by the demyelinated neurons is slowed, and the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels spread outward from the nodes, lowering their nodal concentration. The cause of the disease is not known but appears to involve either the body's production of auto-antibodies (antibodies that bind to normal body proteins) that react with MBP, or the secretion of proteases that destroy myelin proteins. A mouse mutant, shiverer, has a deletion of much of the MBP gene, leading to tremors, convulsions, and early death. Similarly, human (Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease) and mouse (jimpy) mutations in the gene coding for the other major protein of CNS myelin, PLP, cause loss of oligodendrocytes and inadequate myelination.

Schwann Cells Schwann cells form myelin sheaths around peripheral nerves. A Schwann cell myelin sheath is a remarkable spiral wrap (Figure 22-17b). A long axon can have as many as several hundred Schwann cells along its length, each contributing myelin insulation to an internode stretch of about $1-1.5 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ of axon. For reasons that are not understood, not all axons are myelinated. Mutations in mice that eliminate Schwann cells cause the death of most neurons.

In contrast to oligodendrocytes, each Schwann cell myelinates only one axon. The sheaths are composed of about 70 percent lipid (rich in cholesterol) and 30 percent
protein. In the PNS, the principal protein constituent ( $\sim 80$ percent) of myelin is called protein $0\left(\mathrm{P}_{0}\right)$, an integral membrane protein that has immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. MBP is also an abundant component. The extracellular Ig domains of $\mathrm{P}_{0}$ bind together the surfaces of sequential wraps around the axon to compact the spiral of myelin sheath (Figure 22-18). Other proteins play this kind of role in the CNS.

In humans, peripheral myelin, like CNS myelin, is a target of autoimmune disease, mainly involving the formation of antibodies against $\mathrm{P}_{0}$. The Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), also known as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy, is one such disease. GBS is the most common cause of rapid-onset paralysis, occurring at a frequency of one person out of 100,000 . The cause is unknown, although it usually follows an acute infectious illness and is thought to involve an immune attack on the peripheral nervous system. The common inherited neurological disorder called Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which damages peripheral motor and sensory nerve function, is due to overexpression of the gene that encodes PMP22 protein, another constituent of peripheral nerve myelin.

Interactions between glia and neurons control the placement and spacing of myelin sheaths, and the assembly of nerve-transmission machinery at the nodes of Ranvier. Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{K}^{+}$pumps, for example, congregate at the nodes of Ranvier through interactions with cytoskeletal proteins. While the details of the node assembly process are not fully understood, a number of key players have been identified. In the PNS, where the process has been most studied, surface adhesion molecules in the Schwann

cell membrane first interact with neuronal surface adhesion molecules. An immunoglobulin cell-adhesion molecule (IgCAM) in the glial membrane, called neurofascin155, contacts two axonal proteins, contactin and contactin-associated protein, at the edge of the node. These cell-cell contact events create boundaries at each side of the node.

The channel proteins and other molecules that will accumulate at the node are initially dispersed throughout the axons. Then axonal proteins, including two IgCAMs called NrCAM and neurofascin186, as well as ankyrin G (Chapter 17), accumulate within the node. The two IgCAMs bind to a single transmembrane domain protein called gliomedin that is expressed in the glial cell. Experiments that eliminated gliomedin production showed that without it nodes do not form, so it is a key regulator, and demonstrates the importance of glial-neuron interactions in proper development of the nervous system. Ankyrin in the node contacts $\beta I V$ spectrin, a major constituent of the cytoskeleton, thus tethering the node's protein complex to the cytoskeleton. $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels become associated with neurofascin186, NrCAM, and ankyrin G, firmly trapping the channel in the nodal segment of the axonal plasma membrane where it is needed. As a result of these multiple protein-protein interactions, the concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels is roughly a hundredfold higher in the nodal membrane of myelinated axons than in the axonal membrane of nonmyelinated neurons.

## Light-Activated Ion Channels and Optogenetics

Unicellular flagellates such as Chlamydomonas (Figure 1-22b) respond rapidly to light through phototaxis, which guides them toward the light, or photophobia, which prevents them from moving toward the light. These rapid photomotility responses are mediated by light-activated cation channels that reside in a specialized photoreceptive organelle called the eyespot. The first light-activated channel to be cloned was from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. This channel, called channelrhodopsin, consists of a seven-transmembrane protein covalently linked to a photo-isomerizable chromophore, all-trans-retinal (Figure 22-19a, b). This is the same chromophore that is used to detect photons in the eye, as discussed in Chapter 15 (see Figure 15-22). When all-trans-retinal absorbs a photon, it converts to 13-cis-retinal, which induces a conformational change in the channel protein, leading to the opening of a pore with a diameter of approximately 0.6 nm and the rapid influx of cations. Channelrhodopsins are nonselective cation channels that conduct $\mathrm{H}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}, \mathrm{K}^{+}$, and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions. Many other lightactivated cation channels have now been identified, and genetic engineering approaches have generated a series of designer channelrhodopsins that are activated or inactivated by specific wavelengths and intensities of light, and to be selective for distinct cations. These advances have given rise to the exciting new field of optogenetics, in which channelrhodopsins are expressed in electrically excitable cells, permitting the use of light to rapidly and selectively manipulate the membrane potential of the cell (Figure 22-19c).

FIGURE 22-19 Channelrhodopsins and optogenetics: activating neurons with light. (a) Light-activated ion channels. Channelrhodopsins are light-activated cation channels that were initially isolated from the green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, where they mediate phototaxic responses. The channel has seven transmembrane domains, and is covalently linked to the photo-isomerizable chromophore all-trans-retinal. (b) All-trans-retinal absorbs blue light ( $\sim 470 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) and changes to the 13-cis-retinal conformation. This leads to a conformational change in the channel, opening a pore through which cations can flow. Opening of channelrhodopsin, shown in (a), leads to influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$from the extracellular solution into the cell, resulting in rapid depolarization of excitable cells. When the light is removed, retinal returns to the all-trans conformation and the channel closes. This is shown in (c) where illumination of a neuron expressing channelrhodopsin with blue light triggers actions potentials as long as the light is on. See J. Wong, O. J. Abilez, and E. Kuhl, 2012, J. Mech. Phys. Solids 60:1158-1178.

Optogenetic approaches have revolutionized the study of neuronal circuits in the brain because they allow neuroscientists to directly test the effect of neural circuit activity on behavior, rather than to simply record neural activity and correlate it with behavior. A common experimental approach is to make transgenic mice in which channelrhodopsin is expressed under the control of a cell-type-specific promoter (described in Chapter 6) so that only a subset of neurons in the brain express the protein. A hole is then made in the skull, and lasers are used to illuminate channelrhodopsin-expressing cells near the surface of the brain, or alternatively a fiber-optic cable is used to deliver light to channelrhodopsin-expressing cells in deeper brain regions. The light triggers action potentials in the neurons, activating their circuits. By examining the behavior of the mouse, one can link the circuit with a specific behavior.

As one example of this type of experiment, the identity of the neurons in the brain that mediate thirst was recently discovered using optogenetics. To do this, channelrhodopsin was expressed in a region of the hypothalamus called the subfornical organ (SFO) in mice (Figure 22-20). In one mouse line, channelrhodopsin was expressed exclusively in excitatory neurons, and in the other mouse line, it was expressed in inhibitory neurons. Light was delivered to the SFO using a fiber-optic cable, and when the excitatory neurons were depolarized with light, the mice exhibited thirst (seeking water and drinking intensely), but when the inhibitory neurons were activated, thirst was suppressed. Additional experiments showed that the drinking response is specific to water, and is not activated by other compounds such as mineral oil or glycerol. Together these experiments demonstrate that neurons in the SFO of the hypothalamus regulate thirst, with activation of excitatory neurons promoting thirst and activation of inhibitory neurons repressing

FIGURE 22-20 Using optogenetics to dissect neural circuits mediating thirst. (a) Channelrhodopsin tagged with a fluorescent protein (YFP) was expressed in excitatory neurons in the subfornical organ (SFO) of the hypothalamus using an excitatory neuron-specific promoter. Neurons expressing channelrhodopsin-YFP were confirmed to be excitable by illumination with blue light in acute hypothalamic slices. (b) When excitatory neurons in the SFO of living mice are activated by blue light, the mice seek water and drink large volumes even if they are well hydrated. [Data from Y. Oka, M. Ye and C. S.

thirst. Similar approaches have been used to uncover circuits underlying many other behaviors, including locomotion, feeding and overeating, anxiety, aggression, and other social behaviors. In addition, optogenetic approaches can be used with other methods, such as calcium imaging (see Chapter 4 and below, Section 22.3) to map out the anatomy of specific circuits in the brain. This is done by activating a specific neuron with light and then using imaging approaches to visualize activity (e.g., by monitoring calcium dynamics) in downstream neurons.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 22.2

## Voltage-Gated Ion Channels and the Propagation of Action Potentials

- Action potentials are sudden membrane depolarizations followed by rapid repolarization.
- An action potential results from the sequential opening and closing of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the plasma membrane of neurons and muscle cells (excitable cells; see Figure 22-10).
- Opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels permits influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions for about 1 ms , causing a sudden large depolarization of a segment of the membrane. The channels then close and become unable to open (refractory period) for several milliseconds, preventing further $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$flow (see Figure 22-10).
- As the action potential reaches its peak, opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels permits efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions, which repolarizes and then hyperpolarizes the membrane. As these channels close, the membrane returns to its resting potential (see Figures 22-2 and 22-9).
- The excess cytosolic cations associated with an action potential generated at one point on an axon spread passively to the adjacent segment, triggering opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the vicinity and thus propagation of the action potential along the axon.
- Because of the absolute refractory period of the voltagegated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and the brief hyperpolarization resulting from $\mathrm{K}^{+}$efflux, the action potential is propagated in one direction only, toward the axon termini (see Figure 22-12).
- Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are monomeric proteins containing four domains that are structurally and functionally similar to each of the subunits in the tetrameric voltagegated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels. Each domain or subunit in voltage-gated cation channels contains six transmembrane $\alpha$ helices and a nonhelical P segment that forms the ion-selectivity pore (see Figure 22-13).
- Opening of voltage-gated channels results from movement of the positively charged S1-S4 paddles toward the extracellular side of the membrane in response to a depolarization of sufficient magnitude (see Figure 22-14).

- Closing and inactivation of voltage-gated cation channels result from movement of a cytosolic "ball" segment into the open pore (see Figure 22-10).
- While the voltage sensor and inactivation gate of voltagegated $\mathrm{K}+$ channels and voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}+$ channels are similar, the structure of the selectivity filter is different, and provides specificity for the type of ion that is conducted through the channel.
- Myelination, which increases the rate of impulse conduction up to a hundredfold, permits the close packing of neurons characteristic of vertebrate brains.
- In myelinated neurons, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels are concentrated at the nodes of Ranvier. Depolarization at one node spreads rapidly with little attenuation to the next node, so that the action potential jumps from node to node (see Figure 22-16).
- Myelin sheaths are produced by glial cells that wrap themselves in spirals around neurons. Oligodendrocytes produce myelin for the CNS; Schwann cells, for the PNS (see Figure 22-17).
- The field of optogenetics is revolutionizing the study of neural circuits. It involves the genetic expression of lightactivated cation channels, called channelrhodopsins, in neurons, and the use of light to specifically activate or inhibit that population of neurons. In this way, neuroscientists can directly link specific neural circuits with specific behaviors.


### 22.3 Communication at Synapses

As we have discussed, electrical pulses transmit signals along neurons, but signals are transmitted between neurons and other excitable cells mainly by chemical signals. Synapses are the junctions where presynaptic neurons release these chemical signals, or neurotransmitters, which then act on postsynaptic target cells (see Figure 22-3). A target cell may be another neuron, a muscle, or a gland cell. Communication at chemical synapses usually goes in only one direction: pre- to postsynaptic cell.

Arrival of an action potential at an axon terminus in a presynaptic cell leads to opening of voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ plasma membrane channels and an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, causing a localized rise in the cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the axon terminus. In turn, the rise in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ triggers fusion of small ( $40-50 \mathrm{~nm}$ ) neurotransmitter-containing synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane, releasing neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft, the narrow space separating the presynaptic from the postsynaptic cell. The membrane of the postsynaptic cell is located within approximately 20 nm of the presynaptic membrane, reducing the distance the neurotransmitter must diffuse.

Neurotransmitters-small, water-soluble molecules such as glutamate (excitatory) or gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA, inhibitory)-bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell that, in turn, induce localized changes in the potential
across its plasma membrane. If the membrane potential becomes less negative-that is, becomes depolarized-an action potential will tend to be induced in the postsynaptic cell. Such synapses are excitatory, and in general involve the opening of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the postsynaptic plasma membrane. In contrast, in an inhibitory synapse, binding of the neurotransmitter to a receptor on the postsynaptic cell causes hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane-generation of a more inside-negative potential. Typically, hyperpolarization is the result of opening of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$or $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels in the postsynaptic plasma membrane, which tends to hinder generation of an action potential.

Neurotransmitter receptors fall into two broad classes: ligand-gated ion channels, which open immediately upon neurotransmitter binding, and metabotropic G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Neurotransmitter binding to a GPCR induces the opening or closing of a separate ion-channel protein over a period of seconds to minutes. These "slow" neurotransmitter receptors were discussed in Chapter 15 along with GPCRs that bind different types of ligands and modulate the activity of cytosolic proteins other than ion channels. In the central nervous system, glutamate and GABA bind primarily to ionotropic receptors to mediate excitation and inhibition, respectively, while neuromodulators like serotonin and dopamine bind to metabotropic receptors. In the peripheral nervous system, the main neurotransmitters are acetylcholine and norepinephrine (also called noradrenaline), both of which are also expressed in the central nervous system.

The duration of the neurotransmitter signal depends on the amount of transmitter released by the presynaptic cell, which in turn depends on the amount of transmitter that had been stored as well as the frequency of action potentials arriving at the synapse. The duration of the signal also depends on how rapidly any unbound neurotransmitter is degraded in the synaptic cleft or transported back into the presynaptic cell. Presynaptic cell plasma membranes, as well as glia, contain transporter proteins that pump neurotransmitters across the plasma membrane back into the cell, thus keeping the extracellular concentrations of transmitter low.

In this section we focus first on how synapses form and how they control the regulated secretion of neurotransmitters in the context of the basic principles of vesicular trafficking outlined in Chapter 14. Next we look at the mechanisms that limit the duration of the synaptic signal, and how neurotransmitters are received and interpreted by the postsynaptic cell.

## Formation of Synapses Requires Assembly of Presynaptic and Postsynaptic Structures

Axons extend from the cell body during development, guided by signals from other cells along the way so that the axon termini will reach the correct location (see Section 18.8). As axons grow, they come into contact with their potential target cells, such as dendrites of other neurons, and often at such sites synapses form. In the CNS, synapses with presynaptic specializations occur frequently all along an axon, and are called en passant (in passing) synapses; in contrast, motor neurons form synapses with muscle cells only at the axon termini.

![li14135345559](li14135345559.jpg)

Neurons cultured in isolation will not form synapses very efficiently, but when glia are added, the rate of synapse formation increases substantially. Astrocytes and Schwann cells send protein signals to neurons to stimulate the formation of synapses and then help to preserve them. One such signal is thrombospondin (TSP), a component of the extracellular matrix; mice lacking two thrombospondin genes have only 70 percent of the normal number of synapses in their brains. Additional glial-derived signals are required for the formation of functional synapses, including glial-derived cholesterol, the extracellular matrix protein hevin, and glypicans (heparin sulfate proteoglycans). Mutual communication between neurons and the glia that surround them is frequent and complex, making the signals and information they carry an area of active research. New imaging approaches have revealed that astrocytes form a multitude of small branches that intercalate with neurons and ensheath synapses. Thus not only do astrocytes provide glial-derived factors to promote synapse formation, but many neuroscientists propose that the synapse, composed of presynaptic and postsynaptic partners, should be considered a tripartite synapse, composed not only of pre- and postsynaptic neuronal elements, but also of astrocytes (see Figure 22-21).

At the site of a synapse, the presynaptic neuron has hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles, some docked

FIGURE 22-21 Astrocytes and the tripartite synapse. (a) Many synapses are ensheathed by astroglial processes, as shown in this electron micrograph of a synapse in the rodent hippocampus. The postsynaptic compartment (dendrite and dendritic spine) is highlighted in green, the presynaptic terminal in orange, and astroglial process in blue. (b) Astrocytes not only ensheath the synapse, but they also secrete a number of factors that promote correct synapse formation. These include thrombospondin, hevin, glypicans, and cholesterol. Indicative of the importance of astrocytes in neuronal synapse formation, when neurons are grown in cell culture, they require astrocytes for proper synapse formation and development.

at the membrane and others waiting in reserve. The release of neurotransmitter into the synaptic cleft occurs in the active zone, a specialized region of the plasma membrane containing a remarkable assemblage of proteins whose functions include modifying the properties of the synaptic vesicles and bringing them into position for docking and fusing with the plasma membrane. Viewed by electron microscopy, the active zone has electron-dense material and fine cytoskeletal filaments (Figure 22-22). A similarly dense region of specialized structures is seen across the

In this longitudinal section through a neuromuscular junction, the basal lamina lies in the synaptic cleft separating the neuron from the muscle membrane, which is extensively folded.

synapse in the postsynaptic cell, the postsynaptic density (PSD). Cell-adhesion molecules that connect pre- and postsynaptic cells keep the active zone and PSD aligned. After release of synaptic vesicles in response to an action potential, the presynaptic neuron retrieves synaptic vesicle membrane proteins by endocytosis both within and outside the active zone.

Synapse assembly has been extensively studied at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Figure 22-23). At these
![li14335345559](li14335345559.jpg)
synapses acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter produced by motor neurons, and its receptor, AChR, is produced by the postsynaptic muscle cell. Muscle cell precursors, myoblasts, put into culture will spontaneously fuse into multinucleate myotubes that look similar to normal muscle cells. As myotubes form, AChR is produced near the center of the cell and inserted into the myotube plasma membrane, forming diffuse membrane patches (Figure 22-23a).

The formation of the neuromuscular synapse is a multistep process requiring signaling interactions between motor neurons and muscle fibers. A key player is MuSK, a receptor tyrosine kinase that is localized in the diffuse AChR-rich patches of the myotube plasma membrane. In ways that are not known, MuSK both induces clustering of AChRs and serves to attract the termini of growing motor neuron axons. For example, knockdown of MuSK inhibits both processes, while overexpression of MuSK in cultured muscle cells induces motor neuron growth throughout the muscle and formation of excess synapses.

FIGURE 22-23 Formation of the neuromuscular junction.
(a) Motor neuron-myotube interactions. Following fusion of myoblasts to form multinucleate myotubes, the nuclei synthesize acetylcholine receptor (AChR) mRNA. The nuclei near the center of each muscle fiber synthesize significantly more AChR mRNA than other nuclei. AChRs together with MuSK receptor kinases accumulate in membrane patches near the center of the cell, the prospective synaptic region of the muscle, prior to and independent of innervation; the cell is said to be "prepatterned." The motor neuron axon termini grow toward these AChR clusters and secrete the glycoprotein Agrin. Agrin, in turn, induces clustering of the AChRs (dark red) and MuSKs around the axon termini (green), forming the neuromuscular junction. (Inset) Micrograph of a synapse from a postnatal (3-week-old) mouse, viewed by staining for axons (neurofilament) and synaptic vesicles (synaptophysin), shown together in green, and AChRs, shown in red. (b) Signaling downstream of Agrin receptors. Motor axons secrete Agrin, which stabilizes postsynaptic differentiation by binding LRP4 and activating MuSK kinase activity. Phosphorylation of tyrosines in the MuSK juxtamembrane region, indicated by yellow $P$ in circle, stimulates recruitment and tyrosine phosphorylation of Dok-7, an adapter protein that is expressed selectively in muscle, which forms a dimer, stimulates MuSK kinase activity, and recruits the adapter protein Crk/Crk-L. Crk/Crk-L is essential to activate a Rac/Rho- and Rapsyn-dependent pathway for clustering AChRs opposite the presynaptic axon termini; this pathway involves several cytoskeletal proteins including actin and myosins. The pathway for synapse-specific transcription is less well understood but likely involves JNK kinase-dependent activation of ETS-family transcription factors that stimulate expression of multiple genes encoding synaptic proteins such as acetylcholine receptors, MuSK, LRP4, and acetylcholinesterase (AChE), the extracellular enzyme that localizes to the synaptic cleft and that degrades acetylcholine to choline and acetate.

Another key player is Agrin, a glycoprotein synthesized by developing motor neurons, transported in vesicles along axon microtubules, and secreted near the developing myotubes. Agrin binds to LRP4, a single-pass membranespanning protein; this stimulates an association between LRP4 and MuSK and increases MuSK kinase activity (Figure 22-23b). This leads to activation of several downstream signal transduction pathways, one of which leads to activation of Rac and Rho (see Section 17.3) and formation of clusters of AChRs with the cytoskeletal protein rapsyn; this interaction, together with binding of other cytoskeletal proteins including actin, leads to localization of AChRs opposite the nerve termini at the neuromuscular junction. The density of acetylcholine receptors in a mature synapse reaches $\sim 10,000-20,000 / \mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$, while elsewhere in the plasma membrane the density is $\sim 10 / \mu \mathrm{m}^{2}$. Another pathway, also not well understood, leads to activation of ETSfamily transcription factors and stimulation of expression of multiple genes encoding synaptic proteins such as rapsyn and AChRs.

While the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of synapses in the central nervous system are less well understood, the process appears to follow a similar logic, in which interactions between the pre- and postsynaptic compartments trigger a reorganization of already synthesized synaptic components. Analogous to the function of rapsyn in clustering ACh receptors at the neuromuscular synapse, distinct scaffolding proteins cluster neurotransmitter receptors at excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the central nervous system. A large PDZ-containing (see Chapter 20 for definition of PDZ domains) protein called PSD95 clusters glutamate receptors at excitatory synapses, while another scaffolding protein called gephryin clusters GABA and glycine receptors at inhibitory synapses (Figure 22-24). Preand postsynaptic compartments are linked by a network of trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules, whose adhesive interactions are so strong that it is not possible to biochemically separate the presynaptic compartment from the postsynaptic compartment. These adhesion molecules include cadherins, immunoglobulin-containing cell adhesion molecules (described in Chapter 20), neurexins and neuroligins, ephrins, and Eph receptors. Synaptic adhesion molecules bind scaffolding proteins and cytoskeletal elements through their intracellular domains, promoting organization of protein complexes in both presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments. Mixed cell culture systems, in which primary neurons are cultured with non-neuronal cells expressing an adhesion molecule of interest, have been useful in demonstrating the ability of specific adhesion molecules to promote synapse assembly. For example, expression of the postsynaptic adhesion molecule neurexin in non-neuronal cells is sufficient to promote presynaptic specializations in axons, including formation of active zone components with clusters of synaptic vesicles.

Precise wiring in the nervous system involves not only synapse formation, but also synapse elimination. At birth,

FIGURE 22-24 PSD95 and gephyrin are scaffolding proteins for excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic compartments, respectively. (a) The PDZ-containing protein PSD95 is part of the postsynaptic density at excitatory synapses and associates with glutamate receptors and with the actin cytoskeleton. The scaffolding protein gephyrin plays an analogous role at inhibitory synapses, where it associates with GABA receptors and with the microtubule and actin cytoskeletal networks. (b) PSD95 and gephyrin can be used to mark excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively. Shown in green are the PSD95-containing excitatory synapses and, in red, the gephyrincontaining inhibitory synapses that form on a single mouse cortical neuron in culture.

most animals are born with an excess number of synapses, and neural circuit maturation involves a critical process of synaptic pruning that eliminates a large number of synapses. Synaptic pruning is dependent on neural activity, and studies indicate that the weaker synapses are eliminated while the stronger synapses are maintained. For example, at birth each muscle cell is innervated by multiple motor neurons, but over time many of the motor neuron contacts are eliminated so that eventually each muscle cell is innervated by a single motor neuron. This process of synapse elimination is dependent on activity in the muscle cell: if the muscle cell is pharmacologically silenced, it never loses its polyneuronal innervation. The cell biological mechanisms underlying synapse elimination, including the mechanisms that specify which synapses should be eliminated and the process of elimination itself, are areas of active research. Many recent studies have uncovered roles for astrocytes and microglia in the phagocytosis of eliminated synapses during synaptic pruning.

## Neurotransmitters Are Transported into Synaptic Vesicles by $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-Linked Antiport Proteins

In this section, we focus on how neurotransmitters are packaged in membrane-bound synaptic vesicles in the axon terminus. Numerous small molecules function as neurotransmitters at various synapses. With the exception of acetylcholine, the most common neurotransmitters, as shown in Figure 22-25, are amino acids or derivatives of amino acids. Nucleotides such as ATP and the corresponding nucleosides, which lack phosphate groups, also function as neurotransmitters. While neurons were previously thought to make only one type of neurotransmitter, more recent studies indicate that some neurons can produce and release more than one neurotransmitter. While the types of neurotransmitters are varied and while they operate in different parts of the nervous system, all signaling by neurotransmitters results in one of two outcomes: either the induction of an electrical signal or its inhibition.

All of these neurotransmitters are synthesized in the cytosol and imported into membrane-bound synaptic vesicles within axon termini, where they are stored. These vesicles are $40-50 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter, and their lumen has a low pH , generated by operation of a V -class proton pump in the vesicle membrane. Similar to the accumulation of metabolites in plant vacuoles (see Figure 11-29), this proton concentration gradient (vesicle lumen $>$ cytosol)

FIGURE 22-25 Structures of several small molecules that function as neurotransmitters. Except for acetylcholine, all of these molecules are amino acids (glycine and glutamate) or derived from the indicated amino acids. The three transmitters synthesized from tyrosine, which contain the catechol moiety (blue highlight), are referred to as catecholamines.

FIGURE 22-26 Cycling of neurotransmitters and of synaptic vesicles in axon termini. Most synaptic vesicles are formed by endocytic recycling as depicted here. The entire cycle typically takes about 60 seconds. Step The uncoated vesicles express a V-type proton pump (orange) and a single type of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-neurotransmitter antiporter (blue) specific for the particular neurotransmitter, to import neurotransmitters (red dots) from the cytosol. Step $\mathbf{\square}$ Synaptic vesicles loaded with neurotransmitter move to the active zone. Step Vesicles dock at defined sites on the plasma membrane of the presynaptic cell, and the vesicle v-SNAREs called VAMP bind to the plasma membrane t-SNAREs, forming a SNARE complex. Synaptotagmin prevents membrane fusion and release of neurotransmitter. Botulinum toxin prevents exocytosis by proteolytically cleaving VAMP, the v-SNARE on vesicles. Step $\mathbf{B}$ In response to a nerve impulse (action potential), voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane open, allowing an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the extracellular medium. The resulting $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced conformational
powers neurotransmitter import by ligand-specific $\mathrm{H}^{+}$-linked neurotransmitter antiporters in the vesicle membrane (Figure 22-26).

For example, acetylcholine is synthesized in the cytosol from acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl CoA), an intermediate in the degradation of glucose and fatty acids, and choline in a reaction catalyzed by choline acetyltransferase:
change in synaptotagmin leads to fusion of docked vesicles with the plasma membrane and release of neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft. Synaptotagmin does not participate in the later steps of vesicle recycling or neurotransmitter import though it is still present. Step $\mathbf{B}$ $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$symporter proteins take up neurotransmitter from the synaptic cleft into the cytosol, which limits the duration of the action potential and partially recharges the cell with transmitter. Step Vesicles are recovered by endocytosis, creating uncoated vesicles, ready to be refilled and begin the cycle anew. After clathrin/AP vesicles containing v-SNARE and neurotransmitter transporter proteins bud inward and are pinched off in a dynamin-mediated process, they lose their coat proteins. Dynamin mutations such as shibire in Drosophila block the re-formation of synaptic vesicles, leading to paralysis. Unlike most neurotransmitters, acetylcholine is not recycled. See K. Takei et al., 1996, J. Cell Biol. 133:1237; V. Murthy and C. Stevens, 1998, Nature 392:497; and R. Jahn et al., 2003, Cell 112:519.
![li14935345559](li14935345559.jpg)

Synaptic vesicles take up and concentrate acetylcholine from the cytosol against a steep concentration gradient, using an $\mathrm{H}^{+} /$acetylcholine antiporter in the vesicle membrane. As with other antiporters, the export of protons from the forming vesicle down its electrochemical gradient powers the uptake of the neurotransmitter. As an example of an evolutionary mechanism to ensure coordinate expression of these two proteins, the gene encoding this antiporter is contained entirely within the first intron of the gene encoding choline acetyltransferase.

Different $\mathrm{H}^{+}$/neurotransmitter antiport proteins are used for import of other neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles. For example, glutamate is imported into synaptic vesicles by a family of proteins called vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). VGLUTs are highly specific for glutamate but have rather low substrate affinity ( $K_{\mathrm{m}}=1-3 \mathrm{mM}$ ). Another family of transporters, the vesicular GABA transporters (VGATs) transport GABA and glycine into synaptic vesicles. Like the acetylcholine transporter, VGLUTs and VGATs are antiporters, moving glutamate and GABA or glycine into synaptic vesicles while protons move in the other direction. VGLUT and VGAT serve as useful markers for excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals, respectively.

## Three Pools of Synaptic Vesicles Loaded with Neurotransmitter Are Present in the Presynaptic Terminal

A highly organized arrangement of cytoskeletal fibers in the axon terminus helps localize synaptic vesicles within the presynaptic terminal. The population of synaptic vesicles has been proposed to exist in three states: a small readily releasable pool, which is docked at the active zone near the plasma membrane; a larger recycling pool, which is proximal but not docked at the plasma membrane and is released with moderate stimulation; and a reserve pool, which includes the majority of synaptic vesicles in the terminal, is the most distal from the active zone, and is released only in response to strong stimuli. A family of phosphoproteins called synapsins tether synaptic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton and to one another. Neuronal stimulation activates kinases that phosphorylate synapsins to modulate synaptic vesicle tethering and thereby alter the number of synaptic vesicles available for release. Indeed, synapsin knockout mice, although viable, are prone to seizures; during repetitive stimulation of many neurons in such mice, the number of synaptic vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane is greatly reduced.

## Influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ Triggers Release of Neurotransmitters

The exocytosis of neurotransmitters from synaptic vesicles involves vesicle-targeting and fusion events similar to those that occur during the intracellular transport of secreted and plasma-membrane proteins (Chapter 14). However, two unique features critical to synapse function differ from other secretory pathways: (1) secretion is tightly coupled to arrival
of an action potential at the axon terminus, and (2) synaptic vesicles are recycled locally to the axon terminus after fusion with the plasma membrane. Figure 22-26 shows the entire cycle whereby synaptic vesicles are filled with neurotransmitter, release their contents, and are recycled.

Depolarization of the plasma membrane cannot, by itself, cause synaptic vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane. In order to trigger vesicle fusion, an action potential must be converted into a chemical signal-namely, a localized rise in the cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration. The transducers of the electrical signals are voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels localized to the region of the plasma membrane adjacent to the synaptic vesicles. The membrane depolarization due to arrival of an action potential opens these channels, permitting an influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions from the extracellular medium into the region of the axon terminus near the docked synaptic vesicles. Importantly, the rise in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is localized; it is also transient, as the excess $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is rapidly pumped out of the cell by plasma membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps.

The bacterial voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel is likely the evolutionary ancestor of both voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. Specifically, the structures of the voltagesensing module and of the pore module, as well the structural mechanisms underlying voltage-dependent activation and slow voltage-dependent inactivation, are conserved. The bacterial voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel is unique among these channels in that it is selective for calcium ions. How does this channel achieve high and selective conductance for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ when the extracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$is 140 mM and the extracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ is only 2 mM ? To determine the structural basis of this selectivity, scientists mutated residues in the selectivity pore of the bacterial voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel to residues that were found in voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. This turned the bacterial channel into a voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel whose structure could be solved by x-ray crystallography. These studies showed that mutation of a single serine residue in the selectivity filter to an aspartate converted the channel to one that was calcium selective, conducting calcium ions with a single shell of hydration. This mutation, together with additional mutations that changed the electronegativity of the pore, provided sufficient selectivity to conduct $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ over $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ despite the relative abundance of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions in the extracellular space. While the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channels are the most important contributors to the generation of action potentials, the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are essential for the conversion of electrical signals into chemical signals, since the influx of calcium into the neuron triggers a series of signal transduction cascades that leads to the release of synaptic vesicles and the transmission of the electrical signal from the one neuron to another neuron.

The development of fluorescent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ indicators has provided a powerful means of visualizing synaptic activity in neurons in culture and in intact neural circuits. As discussed in Chapter 4, these indicators are fluorescent molecules that change their fluorescence emission upon $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ binding, and include both chemical indicators and genetically encoded

indicators. Delivery or expression of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ indicators to neurons in a circuit allow experimenters to use time-lapse microscopy to monitor $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ transients in hundreds of neurons and glia in real time. For example, expression of the genetically encoded $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ indicator GCaMP6 in the visual cortex of mice, combined with presentation of visual stimuli and in vivo two-photon microscopy, has been used to identify the population of neurons that respond to specific orientations of visual information (Figure 22-27).

A single action potential leads to exocytosis of about $10 \%$ of synaptic vesicles in a presynaptic terminal. Membrane proteins unique to synaptic vesicles then are specifically internalized by endocytosis, usually via the same types of clathrin-coated vesicles used to recover other plasmamembrane proteins by other types of cells. After the endocytosed vesicles lose their clathrin coat, they are rapidly refilled with neurotransmitter. The ability of many neurons to fire 50 times a second is clear evidence that the recycling of vesicle membrane proteins occurs quite rapidly. The machinery of endocytosis and exocytosis is highly conserved, and is described in more detail in Chapter 14.

## A Calcium-Binding Protein Regulates Fusion of Synaptic Vesicles with the Plasma Membrane

Fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane of axon termini depends on SNAREs, the same type of proteins that mediate membrane fusion of other regulated secretory vesicles, and SM proteins (for Sec1/Munc18-like proteins). The principal v-SNARE in synaptic vesicles (VAMP) tightly
(a)
![li15035345559](li15035345559.jpg)
binds syntaxin and SNAP-25, the principal t-SNAREs in the plasma membrane of axon termini, to form four-helix SNARE complexes. The assembly of the SNARE complex brings the synaptic vesicle membrane into close proximity to the presynaptic plasma membrane, but the formation of a fusion pore requires an additional step, association of an SM protein with syntaxin. After fusion, proteins within the axon terminus promote disassociation of VAMP from t-SNAREs, as in the fusion of secretory vesicles depicted in Figure 14-10.

B
Strong evidence for the role of VAMP in neurotransmitter exocytosis is provided by the mechanism of action of botulinum toxin, a bacterial protein that can cause the paralysis and death characteristic of botulism, a type of food poisoning. The toxin is composed of two polypeptides: One binds to motor neurons that release acetylcholine at synapses with muscle cells, facilitating entry of the other polypeptide, a protease, into the cytosol of the axon terminus. The only protein this protease cleaves is VAMP (see Figure 22-26, step 3). After the botulinum protease enters an axon terminus, synaptic vesicles that are not already docked rapidly lose their ability to fuse with the plasma membrane because cleavage of VAMP prevents assembly of SNARE complexes. The resulting block in acetylcholine release at neuromuscular synapses causes paralysis. However, vesicles that are already docked exhibit remarkable resistance to the toxin, indicating that SNARE complexes may already be in a partially assembled, protease-resistant state when vesicles are docked on the presynaptic membrane.

FIGURE 22-27 Calcium indicators allow visualization of activity in neural circuits. A genetically encoded calcium indicator was expressed in neurons in the mouse visual cortex. (a) A window was made in the skull of the mouse, and a microscope (indicated by the objective lens) was used to visualize calcium transients in populations of neurons in the visual cortex while the mouse was looking at gratings that moved in different directions. Individual neurons within the visual cortex respond to specific orientations of the gratings, as detected by elevations in calcium that are visualized as increases in the fluorescence of the calcium indicator. (b) Neurons were color coded according to the orientation that elicited increases in calcium (as shown below the photo). The neurons shown in yellow respond to horizontally moving gratings, and the neurons shown in cyan respond to vertically moving gratings, while the neurons shown in green and red respond to diagonally oriented gratings. This type of experiment reveals that individual neurons are tuned to specific orientations of visual stimuli. [Photo republished by permission of Nature, from Chen, T.

The signal that triggers exocytosis of docked synaptic vesicles is a very localized rise in the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration in the cytosol near vesicles from $0.1 \mu \mathrm{M}$, characteristic of resting cells, to $1-100 \mu \mathrm{M}$ following arrival of an action potential in stimulated cells. The speed with which synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane after a rise in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (less than 1 ms ) indicates that the fusion machinery is entirely assembled in the resting state and can rapidly undergo a conformational change leading to exocytosis of neurotransmitter (Figure 22-28). A $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding protein called synaptotagmin, located in the membrane of synaptic vesicles, is a key component of the vesicle-fusion machinery that triggers exocytosis in response to $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. A protein
![li15135345559](li15135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-28 Synaptotagmin-mediated fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane. Only a few synaptic vesicles are docked at the presynaptic plasma membrane; these are primed for fusion with the plasma membrane. The tight interconnections between the synaptic vesicle and plasma membrane are mediated in part by bundles of four $\alpha$ helices derived from complexes of vesicle $v$-SNARE and plasma membrane t-SNARE proteins (see Figure 14-10). The fusion of the two membranes is prevented by binding of complexin protein to the v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex. Synaptotagmin is composed of a short intraluminal sequence, a single transmembrane $\alpha$ helix that anchors it in the synaptic vesicle membrane, a linker, and two $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-binding domains termed C2A and C2B. Synaptotagmin without bound $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may also bind to the v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex and prevent membrane fusion. A localized rise in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ allows $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions to bind to synaptotagmin, altering its three-dimensional conformation. This triggers release of the complexin fusion inhibitor, binding (or altered binding) of synaptotagmin to the v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex, instantaneous membrane fusion, and release of neurotransmitters into the extracellular space. The SM protein Munc18, which binds to syntaxin, is required for SNARE-mediated fusion, although its precise mechanisms of action are not known. See T. Südhof and J. Rothman, 2009, Science 323:474 and T. Sudhof, 2013, Neuron 80:675-690.
called complexin is thought to bind to the $\alpha$-helical bundle of an assembled v-SNARE/t-SNARE complex that bridges the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes, preventing the final fusion step. Binding of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to synaptotagmin relieves this inhibition, releasing complexin and allowing the fusion event to occur very rapidly. While the mechanisms by which synaptotagmin functions are debated, Figure 22-28 depicts a widely accepted model.

Several lines of evidence support a role for synaptotagmin as the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ sensor for exocytosis of neurotransmitters. Mutant embryos of Drosophila and C. elegans that completely lack synaptotagmin fail to hatch and exhibit very reduced, uncoordinated muscle contractions. Larvae with partial loss-of-function mutations of synaptotagmin survive, but their neurons are defective in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-stimulated vesicle exocytosis. Moreover, in mice, mutations in synaptotagmin that decrease its affinity for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ cause a corresponding increase in the amount of cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ needed to trigger rapid exocytosis. Mammals express multiple different synaptotagmin isoforms, each of which has a different binding affinity for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and as a result the kinetics of exocytosis depend on the particular synaptotagmin isoform expressed in the neuron.

An important characteristic of synaptic vesicle exocytosis is its speed. Synaptic vesicle fusion occurs within a few hundred microseconds after the arrival of an action potential, which is not very different from the timescale of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx through the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel. What makes this speed possible is the proximity of the release machinery to the voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. This proximity is mediated by two scaffolding proteins called RIM (for Rab3-interacting protein) and RIM-BP (for RIM binding protein), which form a complex between Rab3-containing synaptic vesicles and voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. In mice lacking RIM, and flies lacking RIM-BP, active zones lack voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels, which leads to a dramatic decrease and desynchronization of neurotransmitter release.

## Fly Mutants Lacking Dynamin Cannot Recycle Synaptic Vesicles

Synaptic vesicles are formed primarily by endocytic budding from the plasma membrane of axon termini. Endocytosis usually involves clathrin-coated pits and is quite specific, in that several membrane proteins unique to the synaptic vesicles (e.g., neurotransmitter transporters) are specifically incorporated into the endocytosed vesicles and resident plasma membrane proteins (e.g., the voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel) remain. In this way, synaptic-vesicle membrane proteins can be reused and the recycled vesicles refilled with neurotransmitter (see Figure 22-26, step 6).

As in the formation of other clathrin/AP-coated vesicles, pinching off of endocytosed synaptic vesicles requires the GTP-binding protein dynamin (see Figure 14-19). Indeed, analysis of a temperature-sensitive Drosophila mutant called shibire (shi), which encodes the fly dynamin protein, provided early evidence for the role of dynamin in endocytosis.

At the permissive temperature of $20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, the mutant flies are normal, but at the nonpermissive temperature of $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, they are paralyzed (shibire, "paralyzed," in Japanese) because pinching off of clathrin-coated pits in neurons and other cells is blocked. When viewed in the electron microscope, the shi neurons at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ show abundant clathrin-coated pits with long necks but few clathrin-coated vesicles. The appearance of nerve termini in shi mutants at the nonpermissive temperature is similar to that of termini from normal neurons incubated in the presence of a nonhydrolyzable analog of GTP (see Figure 14-20). Because of their inability to pinch off new synaptic vesicles, the neurons in shi mutants eventually become depleted of synaptic vesicles when flies are shifted to the nonpermissive temperature, leading to a cessation of synaptic signaling and to paralysis.

## Signaling at Synapses Is Terminated by Degradation or Reuptake of Neurotransmitters

Following their release from a presynaptic cell, neurotransmitters must be removed or destroyed to prevent continued stimulation of the postsynaptic cell. Signaling can be terminated by diffusion of a transmitter away from the synaptic cleft, but this is a slow process. Instead, one of two more rapid mechanisms terminates the action of neurotransmitters at most synapses.

Signaling by acetylcholine is terminated when it is hydrolyzed to acetate and choline by acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme localized to the synaptic cleft. Choline released in this reaction is transported back into the presynaptic axon terminus by a $\mathrm{Na}^{+} /$choline symporter and used in synthesis of more acetylcholine. The operation of this transporter is similar to that of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-linked symporters used to transport glucose into cells against a concentration gradient (see Figure 11-26).

With the exception of acetylcholine, all the neurotransmitters shown in Figure 22-25 are removed from the synaptic cleft by transport back into the axon termini that released them. Thus these transmitters are recycled intact, as depicted in Figure 22-26 (step 5). Transporters for GABA, norepinephrine, dopamine, and serotonin were the first to be cloned and studied. These four transport proteins are all $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$-linked symporters. They are $60-70$ percent identical in their amino acid sequences, and each is thought to contain 12 transmembrane $\alpha$ helices. As with other $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$symporters, the movement of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$into the cell down its electrochemical gradient provides the energy for uptake of the neurotransmitter. To maintain electroneutrality, $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$often is transported via an ion channel along with the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and neurotransmitter.

Neurotransmitter transporters are targets of a variety of drugs of abuse as well as many therapeutic drugs commonly used in psychiatry. Cocaine binds to and inhibits the transporters for norepinephrine, serotonin, and dopamine. In particular, binding of cocaine to the dopamine transporter inhibits reuptake of dopamine, causing a higher-than-normal concentration of dopamine to remain in the synaptic cleft and prolonging the stimulation of
postsynaptic neurons. Long-lasting exposure to cocaine, as occurs with habitual use, leads to down-regulation of dopamine receptors and thus altered regulation of dopaminergic signaling. It is thought that decreased dopaminergic signaling after chronic cocaine use may contribute to depressive mood disorders and sensitize important brain reward circuits to the reinforcing effects of cocaine, leading to addiction. Similarly, therapeutic agents such as the antidepressant drugs fluoxetine (Prozac) and imipramine block serotonin reuptake, and the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine blocks norepinephrine reuptake. As a result, these drugs also cause a higher-than-normal concentration of neurotransmitter to remain in the synaptic cleft and prolong the stimulation of postsynaptic neurons. Fluoxetine and similarly acting drugs such as paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft) are often referred to collectively as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).

## Opening of Acetylcholine-Gated Cation Channels Leads to Muscle Contraction

In this section we look at how binding of neurotransmitters by receptors on postsynaptic cells leads to changes in the cells' membrane potential, using the communication between motor neurons and muscles as an example. At these synapses, called neuromuscular junctions, acetylcholine is the neurotransmitter. A single axon terminus of a frog motor neuron may contain a million or more synaptic vesicles, each containing 1000-10,000 molecules of acetylcholine; these vesicles often accumulate in rows in the active zone (see Figures 22-23 and 22-24). Such a neuron can form synapses with a single skeletal muscle cell at several hundred points.

The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is expressed in muscle cells, is a ligand-gated channel that admits both $\mathrm{K}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$. These receptors are also produced in brain neurons and are important in learning and memory; loss of these receptors is observed in schizophrenia, epilepsy, drug addiction, and Alzheimer's disease. Antibodies against acetylcholine receptors constitute a major part of the autoimmune reactivity in the disease myasthenia gravis. The receptor is so named because it is bound by nicotine; it has been implicated in nicotine addiction in tobacco smokers. There are at least 14 different isoforms of the receptor, which assemble into homo- and heteropentamers with varied properties. Given their many physiological functions and their role in disease, these various isoforms are important targets for new drug development

The effect of acetylcholine on this receptor can be determined by patch-clamp recording from isolated outside-out patches of muscle plasma membranes. Outside-out patchclamp recording is a technique that measures the effects of extracellular solutes on channel receptors within the isolated patch (see Figure 11-22c). Such measurements have shown that acetylcholine causes opening of a cation channel in the receptor capable of transmitting $15,000-30,000 \mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions per millisecond. However, since the resting potential of

the muscle plasma membrane is near $E_{\mathrm{K}}$, the potassium equilibrium potential, opening of acetylcholine receptor channels causes little increase in the efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions; $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions, on the other hand, flow into the muscle cell, driven by the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ electrochemical gradient.

The simultaneous increase in permeability to $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions following binding of acetylcholine produces a net depolarization to about -15 mV from the muscle resting potential of -85 to -90 mV . As shown in Figure 22-29, this localized depolarization of the muscle plasma membrane triggers opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels, leading to generation and conduction of an action potential in the muscle cell surface membrane by the same mechanisms described previously for neurons. When the membrane depolarization reaches transverse tubules (see Figure 17-33), specialized invaginations of the plasma membrane, it acts on $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane apparently without causing them to open. This in turn triggers the opening of adjacent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. The subsequent flow of stored $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions

FIGURE 22-29 Sequential activation of gated ion channels at a neuromuscular junction. Arrival of an action potential at the terminus of a presynaptic motor neuron induces opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the neuron (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ) and subsequent release of acetylcholine, which triggers opening of the ligand-gated acetylcholine receptors in the muscle plasma membrane (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The open receptor channel allows an influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and an efflux of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$from the muscle cell. The $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$influx produces a localized depolarization of the membrane, leading to opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels and generation of an action potential (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). When the spreading depolarization reaches transverse tubules, it is sensed by voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the plasma membrane. Through an unknown mechanism (indicated as ?) these channels remain closed but influence $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane (a network of membrane-bound compartments in muscle), which release stored $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ into the cytosol (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The resulting rise in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ causes muscle contraction by mechanisms discussed in Chapter 17.
from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol raises the cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration sufficiently to induce muscle contraction.

Careful monitoring of the membrane potential of the muscle membrane at a synapse with a cholinergic motor neuron has demonstrated spontaneous, intermittent, and random $\sim 2$-ms depolarizations of about $0.5-1.0 \mathrm{mV}$ in the absence of stimulation of the motor neuron. Each of these depolarizations is caused by the spontaneous release of acetylcholine from a single synaptic vesicle in the neuron. Indeed, demonstration of such spontaneous small depolarizations led to the notion of the quantal release of acetylcholine (later applied to other neurotransmitters) and thereby led to the hypothesis of vesicle exocytosis at synapses. The release of one acetylcholine-containing synaptic vesicle results in the opening of about 3000 ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane, far short of the number needed to reach the threshold depolarization that induces an action potential. Clearly stimulation of muscle contraction by a motor neuron requires the nearly simultaneous release of acetylcholine from numerous synaptic vesicles.

## All Five Subunits in the Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor Contribute to the Ion Channel

The excitatory nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, found at many nerve-muscle synapses, was the first ligand-gated ion channel to be purified, cloned, and characterized at the molecular level, and provides a paradigm for other neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. The acetylcholine receptor from skeletal muscle is a pentameric protein with a subunit composition of $\alpha_{2} \beta \gamma \delta$. These four different subunit types have considerable sequence homology with each other; on average, about $35-40$ percent of the residues in any two subunits are similar, suggesting that they all derived from a common ancestral gene. The complete receptor has fivefold symmetry, and the actual cation channel is a tapered central pore lined by homologous segments from each of the five subunits (Figure 22-30). The channel opens when the receptor cooperatively binds two acetylcholine molecules to sites located at the interfaces of the $\alpha \delta$ and $\alpha \gamma$ subunits, as shown in Figure 22-30a. Once acetylcholine is bound to a receptor, the channel is opened within a few microseconds. Studies measuring the receptor's permeability to different small cations suggest that the open ion channel is, at its narrowest, about $0.65-0.80 \mathrm{~nm}$ in diameter, in agreement with estimates from electron micrographs. This would be sufficient to allow passage of both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions with their shell of bound water molecules.

We have discussed the neuromuscular junction as an excellent example of how neurotransmitters and their receptors work. Like acetylcholine, glutamate, a principal neurotransmitter in the vertebrate brain, uses two main types of receptors. One class, termed ionotropic glutamate receptors, are ligand-gated channels that allow the flow of $\mathrm{K}^{+}, \mathrm{Na}^{+}$, and sometimes $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in response to glutamate binding and that work along the same principles as AChR. Glutamate

![li15335345559](li15335345559.jpg)
also binds to a second class of receptors, coupled to G proteins. Later in this chapter we will see how such G proteincoupled receptors (GPCRs) and ion channels function as receptors for odorants and tastants that activate various sensory nerve cells. To cover all of the neurotransmitter receptors, ion channels, and other signaling proteins that function in the brain would require a book much larger than this one!

For clarity, only the front two subunits, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, are highlighted in (b) (colors: $\alpha$, red; $\beta$, green; $\gamma$, blue; $\delta$, light blue).

Aspartate and glutamate side chains form two rings of negative charges, one at each end of the M2 helices, that help exclude anions from and attract cations to the channel. The gate, which is opened by binding of acetylcholine, lies within the pore. (Data from N. Unwin, 2005, J. Mol. Biol. 346:967-989, PDB ID 2bg9.)

## Nerve Cells Integrate Many Inputs to Make an All-or-None Decision to Generate an Action Potential

At the neuromuscular junction, virtually every action potential in the presynaptic motor neuron triggers an action potential in the postsynaptic muscle cell that propagates along the muscle fiber. The situation at synapses between neurons, especially those in the brain, is much more complex because the postsynaptic neuron commonly receives signals from many presynaptic neurons. The neurotransmitters released from presynaptic neurons may bind to an excitatory receptor on the postsynaptic neuron, thereby opening a channel that admits $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions or both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions. The acetylcholine and glutamate receptors just discussed are examples of excitatory receptors, and opening of such ion channels leads to depolarization of the postsynaptic plasma membrane, promoting generation of an action potential. In contrast, binding of a neurotransmitter to an inhibitory receptor on the postsynaptic cell causes opening of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$channels, leading to an efflux of additional $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ions from the cytosol or an influx of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions. In either case, the ion flow tends to hyperpolarize the plasma membrane, which inhibits generation of an action potential in the postsynaptic cell.

A single neuron can be affected simultaneously by signals received at multiple excitatory and inhibitory synapses. The neuron continuously integrates these signals and determines whether or not to generate an action potential. In this process, the various small depolarizations and hyperpolarizations generated at synapses move along the plasma membrane from the dendrites to the cell body and then to the axon hillock, where they are summed together. An action potential is generated whenever the membrane at the axon hillock becomes depolarized to a certain voltage, which can be different for different neurons, called the threshold potential (Figure 22-31). Thus an action potential is generated in an all-or-nothing fashion: depolarization to the threshold always leads to an action potential, whereas any depolarization that does not reach the threshold potential never induces it.

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 22-31 Incoming signals must reach the threshold potential to trigger an action potential in a postsynaptic neuron. In this example, the presynaptic neuron is generating about one action potential every 4 ms . Arrival of each action potential at the synapse causes a small change in the membrane potential at the axon hillock of the postsynaptic neuron, in this example a depolarization of -5 mV . When multiple stimuli cause the membrane of this postsynaptic cell to become depolarized to the threshold potential, here approximately 40 mV , an action potential is induced.
![li15435345559](li15435345559.jpg)

Whether a neuron generates an action potential in the axon hillock depends on the balance of the timing, amplitude, and localization of all the various inputs it receives; this signal computation differs for each type of neuron. In a sense, each neuron is a tiny analog-to-digital computer that averages all the receptor activations and electrical disturbances on its membrane (analog) and makes a decision whether or not (digital) to trigger an action potential and conduct it down the axon. An action potential will always have the same magnitude in any particular neuron. As we have noted, the frequency with which action potentials are generated in a particular neuron is the important parameter in its ability to signal other cells.

## Gap Junctions Allow Direct Communication Between Neurons and Between Glia

Chemical synapses employing neurotransmitters allow oneway communication at reasonably high speed. However, sometimes signals go from cell to cell electrically, without the intervention of chemical synapses. Electrical synapses depend on gap junction channels that link two cells together (Chapter 20). The effect of gap junction connections is to perfectly coordinate the activities of joined cells. An electrical synapse is usually bidirectional; either neuron can excite the other. Electrical synapses are common in the neocortex and thalamus, for example. The key feature of electrical synapses is their speed. While it takes about $0.5-5 \mathrm{~ms}$ for a signal to cross a chemical synapse, transmission across an electrical synapse is almost instantaneous, on the order of a fraction of a millisecond since the cytoplasm is continuous between the cells. In addition, the presynaptic cell (the one sending the signal) does not have to reach a threshold at which it can cause an action potential in the postsynaptic
cell. Instead, any electrical current continues into the next cell and causes depolarization in proportion to the current.

Gap junctions form between glial cells as well as between neurons. Astrocytes in the brain are connected to one another through gap junctions, which gives rise to the generation of waves of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that propagate through networks of astrocytes in the brain at a speed of $1 \mu \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{sec}$. Gap junctions also form within individual Schwann cells, forming connections between the layers of myelin formed by a single Schwann cell. These gap junctions are thought to facilitate the passage of metabolites and ions between myelin layers.

An electrical synapse may contain thousands of gap channels, each composed of two hemichannels, one in each apposed cell. Gap junction channels in the neuron have a structure similar to conventional gap junctions (see Figure 20-20). Each hemichannel is an assembly of six copies of the connexin protein. Since there are about 20 mammalian connexin genes, diversity in channel structure and function can arise from the different protein components. The $1.6-2.0-\mathrm{nm}$ channel itself allows the diffusion of molecules up to about 1000 Da in size and has no trouble at all accommodating ions.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 22.3

## Communication at Synapses

- Synapses are the junctions between a presynaptic cell and a postsynaptic cell and are the site of communication between neurons (see Figure 22-3).
- Synapse formation is mediated by interactions between presynaptic axonal compartments and postsynaptic dendritic

compartments. Cell-adhesion molecules keep the cells aligned. At the neuromuscular junction, motor neurons induce the accumulation of acetylcholine receptors in the postsynaptic muscle plasma membrane close to the forming axon terminus (see Figure 22-23).

- In presynaptic cells, low-molecular-weight neurotransmitters (e.g., acetylcholine, dopamine, epinephrine) are imported from the cytosol into synaptic vesicles by $\mathrm{H}^{+}-$ linked antiporters. V-class proton pumps maintain the low intravesicular pH that drives neurotransmitter import against a concentration gradient.
- Neurotransmitters (see Figure 22-25) are stored in hundreds to thousands of synaptic vesicles in the axon termini of the presynaptic cell (see Figure 22-23). When an action potential arrives there, voltage-sensitive $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels open and the calcium causes synaptic vesicles to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing neurotransmitter molecules into the synapse (see Figure 22-26, step 4).
- Neurotransmitters diffuse across the synapse and bind to receptors on the postsynaptic cell, which can be a neuron or a muscle cell. Chemical synapses of this sort are unidirectional (see Figure 22-3).
- Synaptic vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane using cellular machinery that is standard for exocytosis, including SNAREs and SM proteins. Synaptotagmin protein is the calcium sensor that detects the action potential-stimulated rise in calcium that leads to the fusion (see Figure 22-28). RIM and RIM-BP tether voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels to the release machinery, ensuring fast coupling between action potentials and neurotransmitter release.
- Following neurotransmitter release from the presynaptic cell, vesicles are re-formed by endocytosis and recycled (see Figure 22-26, step 6).
- Dynamin, an endocytosis protein, is critical for the formation of new synaptic vesicles, specifically for the "pinching off" of inbound vesicles.
- Coordinated operation of four gated ion channels at the synapse of a motor neuron and a striated muscle cell leads to release of acetylcholine from the axon terminus, depolarization of the muscle membrane, generation of an action potential, and subsequent muscle contraction (see Figure 22-29).
- The nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, a ligand-gated cation channel, contains five subunits, each of which has a transmembrane $\alpha$ helix (M2) that lines the channel (see Figure 22-30).
- Neurotransmitter receptors fall into two classes: ligandgated ion channels, which permit ion passage when open, and G protein-coupled receptors, which are linked to separate ion channels.
- A postsynaptic neuron generates an action potential only when the plasma membrane at the axon hillock is depolarized to the threshold potential by the summation of small
depolarizations and hyperpolarizations caused by activation of multiple neuronal receptors (see Figure 22-31).
- Electrical synapses are direct gap junction connections between neurons and between glia. Electrical synapses, unlike chemical synapses that employ neurotransmitters, are extremely fast in signal transmission and are usually bidirectional.


### 22.4 Sensing the Environment: Touch, Pain, Taste, and Smell

Our bodies are constantly receiving signals from our environ-ment-light, sound, smells, tastes, mechanical stimulation, heat, and cold, and our perception of these signals is mediated by the brain. In recent years dramatic progress has been made in understanding how our senses record impressions of the outside world, and how the brain processes that information. For example, in Chapter 15 we analyzed the functions of one of the two types of photoreceptors in the human retina, the rods, and learned how they serve as primary recipients of visual stimulation. Rods are stimulated by weak light, like moonlight, over a range of wavelengths, while the other photoreceptors, the cones, mediate color vision. These photoreceptors synapse on layer upon layer of interneurons that are innervated by different combinations of photoreceptor cells. These signals are processed and interpreted by the part of the brain called the visual cortex, where these nerve impulses are translated into an image of the world around us.

In this section we discuss the cellular and molecular mechanisms and specialized nerve cells underlying several of our other senses: touch and pain, taste, and smell. We see how two broad classes of receptors-ion channels and G proteincoupled receptors-function in these sensing processes. As with vision, multiple interneurons connect these sensory cells with the brain, where relayed signals are converted into perceptions of the environment. For the most part, we still do not fully understand how these neural subsystems are wired, although the new technology of optogenetics is beginning to make inroads into mapping these circuits. In the case of smell, each sensory neuron expresses a single odorant receptor, and we shall see how multiple sensory neurons that express the same receptor activate the same brain center. The connections between odorant binding and perception by the brain are thus direct and fairly well understood.

## Mechanoreceptors Are Gated Cation Channels

Our skin, especially the skin of our fingers, is highly specialized for collecting sensory information. Our whole body, in fact, has numerous mechanosensors embedded in its various tissues. These sensors frequently make us aware of touch, the positions and movements of our limbs or head (proprioception), pain, and temperature, though we often go through periods when we ignore the inputs. Mammals use different

sets of receptor cells to report on touch, temperature, and pain. These mechanosensory receptors are located at the terminals of a class of bipolar sensory neurons called dorsal root ganglion cells. The cell bodies of dorsal root ganglion cells are located in the dorsal root ganglion, adjacent to the spinal cord, and the neurons extend an axon that bifurcates into a peripheral branch that innervates the skin and contains the mechanosensory receptors, and a central branch that projects to the spinal cord or brain stem to relay sensory signals for processing.

Many mechanosensory receptors are $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels that are gated, or opened, in response to specific stimuli; activation of such receptors causes an influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ or both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ ions, leading to membrane depolarization. Examples include the stretch and touch receptors that are activated by stretching of the cell membrane; these have been identified in a wide array of cells, ranging from vertebrate muscle and epithelial cells to yeast, plants, and even bacteria.

The cloning of genes encoding touch receptors began with the isolation of mutant strains of Caenorbabditis elegans that were insensitive to gentle body touching. Three of the genes in which mutations were isolated-MEC4, MEC6, and MEC10—encode three subunits of a $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel in the touch-receptor cells. Studies on worms with mutations in these genes showed that these channels are necessary for transduction of a gentle body touch; biophysical studies indicated that these channels likely open directly in response to mechanical stimulation (Figure 22-32). The touch-sensitive

FIGURE 22-32 The MEC-4 touch-receptor complex in C. elegans. Mutations in any of the MEC genes can reduce or inactivate normal responses of the worm to a gentle body touch. The MEC-4 and MEC-10 proteins are the pore-forming subunits of the $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel; MEC-2 and MEC-6 are accessory subunits that enable channel activity. Mechanotransduction also requires a specialized extracellular matrix, consisting of MEC-5, a collagen isoform, and MEC-1 and MEC-9, both proteins with multiple EGF repeats. MEC-7 and MEC-12 are tubulin monomers that form novel 15-protofilament microtubules that are somehow also required for touch sensitivity. See E. Lumpkin, K. Marshall, and A. Nelson, 2010, J. Cell Biol. 191:237.
complexes contain several other proteins essential for touch sensitivity, including subunits of novel 15-protofilament microtubules in the cytosol and specific proteins in the extracellular matrix, but precisely how they affect channel function is not yet known. Similar kinds of channels are found in bacteria and lower eukaryotes; by opening in response to membrane stretching, these channels may play a role in osmoregulation and the control of a constant cell volume.

## Pain Receptors Are Also Gated Cation Channels

Animals as diverse as snails and humans sense noxious events (the process termed nociception); pain receptors, called nociceptors, respond to mechanical change, heat, and certain toxic chemicals. Pain serves to alert us to events such as tissue damage that are capable of producing injury and evokes behaviors that promote tissue healing. Persistent pain in response to tissue injury is common, and many individuals suffer from chronic pain. Thus understanding both acute and chronic pain is a major research goal, as is the development of new types of drugs to treat pain.

One of the first mammalian pain receptors to be cloned and identified was TRPV1, a $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel that is found in many sensory pain neurons of the peripheral nervous system and is activated by a wide variety of exogenous and endogenous physical and chemical stimuli. The best-known activators of TRPV1 are heat greater than $43^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, acidic pH , and capsaicin, the molecule that makes chili peppers seem hot. Activation of TRPV1 receptors leads to painful, burning sensations. Numerous TRPV1 antagonists have been developed by pharmaceutical companies as possible pain medications. However, a major side effect that has limited the utility of these drugs is that they result in an elevation in body temperature; this suggests that one "normal" function of TRPV1 is to sense and regulate body temperature, and that the drugs inhibit this function.

In a recent landmark study, scientists used single-particle cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM, see Chapter 3) to obtain a high-resolution $(0.34 \mathrm{~nm})$ model of the rat TRPV1 channel in the closed configuration and in two open configurations, one bound to capsaicin and the other bound to two potent TRPV1 activators, one from plant and the other from spider venom. As shown in Figure 22-33, these studies revealed that the TRPV1 channel structure is similar to that of voltage-gated ion channels (see Figure 22-13), composed of four symmetrical subunits with six transmembrane helices (S1-S6) each. However, the charged amino acids in S1-S4 that function as voltage sensors in voltage-gated ion channels are replaced by aromatic residues in TRPV1. This stabilizes the channel core so that instead of moving like voltage sensors upon depolarization, the TRPV S1-S4 helices provide an anchor for movements within the pore that are triggered by ligand binding. Two constrictions, or gates, were identified in the pore region. The spider toxin bound to the extracellular surface of the channel, near the pore helix, and locked open the extracellular end of the channel. Capsaicin and the plant toxin bound to a site deep within the membrane toward the cytoplasmic end of the pore, with binding

increasing the diameter of the pore. These findings indicate that the TRPV channel undergoes dual gating.

Two channels were discovered in 2010 that directly convert mechanical stimuli into cation conductance in vertebrate cells, called Piezo1 and Piezo2 (from the Greek word piesi, which means "pressure"). Both form large cation-selective channels composed of four identical subunits, with each subunit containing over 30 membrane-spanning domains, creating a channel whose molecular weight is about 1.2 million
daltons, and that has between 120 and 160 transmembrane segments! Expression of Piezo1 or Piezo2 induces mechanosensitive-cation currents in these cells. This can be assayed by expressing the channels in cell culture, and using calcium imaging to monitor the response of the cells to stretch induced by poking the cells with a small glass pipette (Figure 22-34). Reduction of Piezo2 expression in dorsal root ganglion sensory neurons in mice reduced their mechanosensitivity, and knockout of the single Piezo homolog

Cryoelectron density maps reveal that the spider toxin (magenta) binds to external domains of the channel, linking two subunits of the channel together via its two globular cysteine-knot domains, while the plant toxin (red) binds to a region deep within the pore. Capsaicin binds to the same sites as the plant toxin (not shown). Binding of agonists to two distinct sites indicates that the TRPV1 channel is dually gated, allowing for significant modulation of channel function.

in Drosophila melanogaster resulted in flies with severely reduced behavioral responses to noxious mechanical stimuli. Together, these experiments show that Piezo channels mediate mechanical signal transduction.

## Five Primary Tastes Are Sensed by Subsets of Cells in Each Taste Bud

We taste many chemicals, all of which are hydrophilic and nonvolatile molecules floating in saliva. All tastes are sensed on all areas of the tongue, and selective cells respond preferentially to certain tastes. Like the other senses, that of taste likely evolved to increase an animal's chance of survival. Many toxic substances taste bitter or acidic, and nourishing foods are broken down into molecules that taste sweet (e.g., sugars), salty, or umami (e.g., the meaty or savory taste of monosodium glutamate and other amino acids). Animals (including humans) can never be certain exactly what enters their mouth; the sense of taste enables an animal to make a quick decision-eat it, or get rid of it. Taste is less demanding of the nervous system than olfaction, because fewer types of molecules are monitored. What is impressive is the sensitivity of taste; bitter molecules can be detected at concentrations as low as $10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$.

There are receptors for salty, sweet, sour, umami, and bitter tastes in all parts of the tongue. The receptors are of two different types: channel proteins for salty and sour tastes and seven-transmembrane-domain proteins (G protein-coupled receptors) for sweetness, umami, and bitterness. Specific membrane receptors that detect fatty acids are present on
![li15735345559](li15735345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-34 Piezo channels are mechanotransducers. (a) To identify channels that transduced mechanical information, cDNAs encoding transmembrane proteins were expressed in heterologous cells, and the response to mechanical perturbation with a glass pipette was determined by patch clamp recording (shown) or by calcium imaging (not shown). (b) When Piezo1 or Piezo2 cDNAs are expressed in cultured cells, poking the cell with
taste bud cells, and fatty taste may come to be recognized as a sixth basic taste quality.

Taste buds are located in bumps in the tongue called papillae; each bud has a pore through which fluid carries solutes inside. Each taste bud has about $50-100$ taste cells (Figure 22-35a, b), which are epithelial cells but with some of the functions of neurons. Microvilli on the taste cells' apical tips bear the taste receptors, directly contacting the external environment in the oral cavity and thus experiencing wide fluctuations in food-derived molecules as well as the presence of potentially harmful compounds. Cells in the tongue and other parts of the mouth are subjected to a lot of wear and tear, and taste bud cells are continuously replaced by cell divisions in the underlying epithelium. (A taste bud cell in a rat has a lifetime of 10 days.)

Reception of a taste signal causes cell depolarization that triggers action potentials; these in turn cause $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ uptake through voltage-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and release of neurotransmitters (Figure 22-35c-e). Taste cells do not grow axons; instead, they signal over short distances to adjacent neurons. These neurons convey the information about taste through multiple connections to a region of the cortex that is specialized for taste, called the insula. To determine how the insula knows that a salty taste receptor as compared to a sweet taste receptor has been activated, scientists performed two-photon imaging (Chapter 4) of insula in mice after presentation of a specific tastant. They used calcium indicators to detect the neurons that were activated, and in this way were able to monitor the activation of large numbers of neurons as calcium-dependent increases in fluorescence. These

Each subunit is extremely large, with over 2000 amino acid residues and over 30 transmembrane domains. The assembled channel thus contains over 120 membrane spanning domains, and has a mass of over 1.2 million daltons (about the same mass as the small subunit of the ribosome)!

(b) Micrograph of a mammalian taste bud, showing the receptor cells. The microvilli are barely visible at the top of the taste bud, indicated by the label. (c) Sweet, bitter, and umami ligands bind specific taste GPCRs expressed in Type II receptor cells, activating a phosphoinositide pathway that elevates cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}-\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in turn binds to and opens a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, TrpM5, leading to an influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and membrane depolarization. The combined action of elevated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and membrane depolarization opens the large pores of an unusual membrane channel termed Panx1, resulting in release of ATP and probably other signaling molecules into the extracellular space. ATP and these other molecules stimulate the nerve cells that
will ultimately carry the information to the brain. (d) Salt is detected by direct permeation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions through membrane ion channels, including the ENaC channel, directly depolarizing the plasma membrane. (e) Organic acids like acetic acid diffuse in their protonated form (H-Ac) through the plasma membrane and dissociate into an anion and proton, acidifying the cytosol. Entry of strong acids like HCl is facilitated by a proton channel in the apical membrane of the sour-sensing cells that enables protons to reach the cytosol. Intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$is believed to block a proton-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel (as yet unidentified) and thus depolarize the membrane. Voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels would open, leading to an elevation in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ that triggers exocytosis of synaptic vesicles that are not depicted. See N. Chaudhari and S. D. Roper, 2010, J. Cell Biol. 190:285; and S. Frings, 2010, PNAS 107:21955. [Part (b) Ed Reschke/Photo Library/Getty Images.]
experiments revealed that four of the tastes-sweet, bitter, umami and salty-are represented in separate, nonoverlapping regions within the insula, thereby demonstrating the existence of a gustotopic map in the brain that mediates our representation of taste.

Bitter Taste Bitter tastants are diverse and are detected by a family of about $25-30$ different G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) known as T2Rs. As depicted in Figure 22-35c, all of these GPCRs activate a particular $\mathrm{G} \alpha$ isoform, called gustducin, which is expressed only in taste cells. However, it is the released ubiquitous $\mathrm{G} \beta \gamma$ subunit of the heterotrimeric

G protein that binds to and activates a specific isoform of phospholipase $\mathrm{C} \beta$, which in turn generates $\mathrm{IP}_{3} . \mathrm{IP}_{3}$ triggers $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (see Figure 15-34). $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in turn binds to and opens a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel, TRPM5, a member of the TRP family of ion channels, leading to an influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and membrane depolarization. The combined action of elevated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and membrane depolarization opens the large pores of a membrane channel termed Panx1, resulting in release of ATP and probably other signaling molecules into the extracellular space. ATP is then thought to stimulate the nerve cells that will ultimately carry the taste information to the brain.

Different bitter taste molecules are quite distinct in structure, which probably accounts for the need for the diverse family of T2Rs. Some T2Rs bind only 2-4 bitter-tasting compounds, whereas others bind a wider variety of bitter compounds. The first member of the T2R family to be identified came from human genetics studies that showed an important bitterness-detection gene on chromosome 5. Mice that have five amino acid changes in the T2R protein T2R5 are unable to detect the bitter taste of cycloheximide (a protein synthesis inhibitor; see Table 4-1). Multiple T2R types are often expressed in the same taste cell, and about 15 percent of all taste cells express T2Rs.

A dramatic gene regulation swap experiment was done to demonstrate the role of T2R proteins. Mice were engineered to express a bitter-taste receptor, a T2R protein, in cells that normally detect sweet tastants that attract mice. The mice developed a strong attraction for bitter tastes, evidently because the cells continued to send a "go and eat this" signal even though they were detecting bitter tastants. This experiment demonstrates that the specificity of taste cells is determined within the cells themselves, and that the signals they send are interpreted according to the neural connections made by that class of cells. It implies that the T2Rexpressing sweet taste receptors were wired to the region of the insula that receives "sweet" signals, and that it was thus represented as a sweet taste.

Sweet and Umami Tastes Sweet and umami tastants are detected by a GPCR family called the T1Rs, which are related to the T2Rs and that also transduce signals through a phosphoinositide signaling pathway. The three mammalian T1Rs differ from one another in a small number of amino acids. The T1Rs have very large extracellular domains that comprise the taste-binding domain of the protein. In the taste-sensing glutamate receptor, the extracellular domain closes around glutamate in a way that is described as analogous to a Venus flytrap. Unlike most GPCRs, which generally function as monomers, T1Rs form homodimers and heterodimers, which is thought to increase the repertoire of molecules that can act as signals. However, the code of responses to different molecules is still under investigation. Mice lacking T1R2 or T1R3 fail to detect sugar; it is thought that the actual receptor is a heterodimer of the two. T1R3 appears to be a receptor for both sweet tastes and umami, and that is because it detects sweets when combined with T1R2 and umami when it combines with T1R1. Accordingly, taste cells express T1R1 or T1R2 but not both, as otherwise they would send an ambiguous message to the brain.

Interestingly, sweet-taste receptors are also found on the surface of certain endocrine cells in the gut; these cells also express gustducin and several other taste transduction proteins. The presence of glucose in the gut causes these cells to secrete the hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which in turn regulates appetite, and enhances insulin secretion and gut motility. Thus certain cells of the gut "taste" glucose through the same mechanisms used by taste cells of the tongue.

Salty Taste The taste of salt is elicited by a wide range of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$concentrations, from 10 mM to 500 mM . Salt is sensed by a member of a family of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels called ENaC channels (Figure 22-35d). Indeed, knocking out a critical ENaC subunit in taste buds impaired salty-taste detection in mice. The influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$through the channel depolarizes the taste cell, leading to neurotransmitter release. The role of ENaC channels as salt sensors is evolutionarily ancient; ENaC proteins also detect salt when expressed in insects. In Drosophila, taste sensors are located in multiple places including the legs, so when the fly steps on something tasty, the proboscis extends to explore it further.

Sour Taste Perception of sourness is due to the detection of $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ions. Many sour tastants are weak organic acids (e.g., acetic acid in vinegar), which in their protonated forms diffuse through the plasma membrane. They then dissociate into an anion and a proton, which acidifies the cytosol. Strong acids like HCl are detected by a proton channel in the apical membrane of the sour-sensing cells that enables protons to reach the cytosol. Regardless of how the intracellular $\mathrm{H}^{+}$concentration is increased, protons are believed to block an as-yet-unidentified proton-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$channel in mammals and thus depolarize the membrane (Figure 22-35e). As with salt detection, voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels would then open, elevate cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, and thus trigger exocytosis of neurotransmitter-filled synaptic vesicles.

## A Plethora of Receptors Detect Odors

The perception of volatile airborne chemicals imposes different demands than the perception of light, sound, touch, or taste. Light is sensed by only four rhodopsin molecules, tuned to different wavelengths. Sound is detected by mechanical effects through hairs that are tuned to different wavelengths. Touch and pain requires a small number of different gated ion channels. The sense of taste measures a small number of substances dissolved in water. In contrast to all these other senses, olfactory systems can discriminate between many hundreds of volatile molecules moving through air. Discrimination between a large number of chemicals is useful in finding food or a mate, sensing pheromones, and avoiding predators, toxins, and fires. Olfactory receptors work with enormous sensitivity. Male moths, for example, can detect single molecules of the signals sent drifting through the air by females. In order to cope with so many signals, the olfactory system employs a large family of olfactory receptor proteins. Humans have about 700 olfactory receptor genes, of which about half are functional (the rest are unproductive pseudogenes), a remarkably large proportion of the estimated 20,000 human genes. Mice are more efficient, with more than 1200 olfactory receptor genes, of which about 800 are functional. That means 3 percent of the mouse genome is composed of olfactory receptor genes. Drosophila has about 60 olfactory receptor genes. In this section we will examine how olfactory receptor genes are employed, and how the brain can recognize which odor has been sensed-the

initial stages of interpretation of our chemical world. Odor molecules are called odorants. They have diverse chemical structures, so olfactory receptors face some of the same challenges faced by antibodies and hormone receptors-the need to bind and distinguish many variants of relatively small molecules.

Olfactory receptors are seven-transmembrane-domain proteins (Figure 22-36). In mammals, olfactory receptors are produced by cells of the nasal epithelium. These cells, called olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs), transduce the chemical signal into action potentials. Each ORN extends a single dendrite to the luminal surface of the epithelium, from which immotile cilia extend to bind inhaled odorants from the air (Figure 22-37a). These olfactory sensory cilia are enriched in the odorant receptors and signal transduction proteins that mediate the initial transduction events. In Drosophila, ORNs have similar structures and are located in the antennae (Figure 22-37b).

In both mammals and Drosophila the ORNs project their axons to the next higher level of the nervous system, which in mammals is located in the olfactory bulb of the brain. The ORN axons synapse with dendrites from mitral neurons in mammals (called projection neurons in insects); these synapses occur in the clusters of synaptic structures called glomeruli. The mitral neurons connect to higher olfactory centers in the brain (Figure 22-38).

FIGURE 22-36 Signal transduction from the olfactory GPCRs. Binding of an odorant to its cognate odorant receptor (OR) triggers activation of the trimeric G protein $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }} \cdot \mathrm{G}_{\beta \gamma}$ releasing the active $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }} \cdot$ GTP. Activated $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }} \cdot$ GTP in turn activates type III adenylyl cyclase (AC3), leading to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP) from ATP. Molecules of cAMP bind to and open the cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channel, leading to the influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and depolarizing the cell. cAMP also activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and thus regulates transcription factors and other intracellular proteins.

(b) Insect olfactory receptor neurons are morphologically similar: the bipolar neuron gives rise to a single basal axon that projects to an olfactory glomerulus in the antennal lobe. At its apical side it has a single dendritic process, from which sensory cilia extend. See U. B. Kaupp, 2010, Nature Rev. Neurosci. 11:188-200.

5Humans vary markedly in their ability to detect certain odors. Some cannot detect the steroid androstenone, a compound derived from testosterone and found in human sweat. Some describe the odor as pleasant and musky, while others compare it to the smell of dirty socks. These differences are all ascribed to inactivating missense mutations in the gene encoding the single androstenone GPCR. Individuals with two copies of the wild-type allele perceive androstenone as unpleasant, whereas those possessing one or no functional alleles perceive androstenone as less unpleasant or undetectable.

Despite the vast number of olfactory receptors, all generate the same intracellular signals through activation of the same trimeric G protein: $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }} \cdot \mathrm{G}_{\beta \gamma}$ (see Figure 22-36). $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }}$ is expressed mainly in olfactory neurons. Like $\mathrm{G}_{\mathrm{ns}}$, the active $\mathrm{G}_{\text {solf }} \cdot$ GTP formed after ligand binding activates an adenylyl cyclase that leads to the production of cyclic AMP (cAMP; see Figure 15-25). Two downstream signaling pathways are activated by cAMP. It binds to a site on the cytosolic face of a cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channel, opening the channel and leading to an influx of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and local depolarization of the cell membrane. This odorantinduced depolarization in the olfactory dendrites spreads throughout the neuronal membrane, resulting in opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channels in the axon hillock and the generation of action potentials. Molecules of cAMP also activate protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates and thus regulates transcription factors and other intracellular proteins.

(b) All of the olfactory receptor neurons that express a single type of receptor send their axons to the same glomerulus. In this figure each color represents the neural connections for each distinct expressed receptor. The glomeruli are located in the olfactory bulb near the brain; in the glomeruli, the ORNs synapse with mitral neurons; each mitral neuron has its dendrites localized to a single glomerulus and its corresponding ORNs, thus carrying information about a particular odorant to higher centers of the brain. Each glomerulus thus receives innervation from sensory neurons expressing a single odorant receptor, providing the anatomical basis of the olfactory sensory map. See T. Komiyama and I. Luo, 2005, Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 16:67-73 and S. Demaria and J. Ngai, 2010, J. Cell Biol. 191:443.

## Each Olfactory Receptor Neuron Expresses a Single Type of Odorant Receptor

The key to understanding the specificity of the olfactory system is that in both mammals and insects each ORN produces
only a single type of odorant receptor. Any electrical signal from that cell will convey to the brain a simple message: "an odorant is binding to my receptors." Receptors are not always completely monospecific for odorants. Some receptors can bind more than one kind of molecule, but the molecules detected are usually closely related in structure. Conversely, some odorants bind to multiple receptors.

There are about 5 million ORNs in the mouse, so on average each of the 800 or so olfactory receptor genes is active in approximately 6000 cells. There are about 2000 glomeruli (roughly 2 for each odorant receptor gene), so on average the axons from a few thousand ORNs converge on each glomerulus (see Figure 22-38). From there about 25 mitral axons per glomerulus, or a total of 50,000 mitral neurons, connect to higher brain centers. Thus the initial odorant sensing information is carried directly to higher parts of the brain without processing, a simple report of what odorant has been detected.

The one neuron-one receptor rule extends to Drosophila. Detailed studies have been done in larvae, where a simple olfactory system with only 21 ORNs uses about 10-20 olfactory receptor genes. It appears that a unique receptor is expressed in each ORN, which sends its projections to one glomerulus. ORNs can send either excitatory or inhibitory signals from their axon termini, probably in order to distinguish attractive versus repulsive odors. Similar to mammals, the axons from the ORNs end in the glomeruli, which in flies are located in the antennal lobe of the larval brain. The research in Drosophila began with tests of which odorants bind to which receptors (Figure 22-39a). Some odorants are detected by a single receptor, some by several, so the combinatorial pattern allows many more odorants to be distinguished than just the number of different olfactory receptors. The small total number of neurons has allowed a map to be constructed showing which odorants are detected by every glomerulus (Figure 22-39b). One striking finding was that glomeruli located near each other respond to odorants with related chemical structures, for example, linear aliphatic compounds or aromatic compounds. The arrangement may reflect evolution of new receptors concomitant with a process of subdivision of the olfactory part of the brain.

The simple system of having each cell make only one receptor type also has some impressive difficulties to overcome: (1) Each receptor must be able to distinguish a type of odorant molecule or a set of molecules with specificity adequate to the needs of the organism. A receptor stimulated too frequently would not be useful. (2) Each cell must express one and only one receptor gene product. All the other receptor genes must be turned off. At the same time, the collective efforts of all the cells in the nasal epithelium must allow the production of enough different receptors to give the animal adequate sensory versatility. It does little good to have genes for hundreds of receptors if most of them are never expressed, but it is a regulatory challenge to turn on one and only one gene in each cell and at the same time express all the receptor genes across the complete population of cells. (3) The neuronal wiring of the olfactory system

(a) The different olfactory receptor proteins are listed across the top, and the 27 odorants tested are shown down the left side. Colored dots indicate strong odor responses. Note that some odorants stimulate multiple receptors (e.g., pentyl acetate), while others (e.g., ethyl butyrate) act on only a single receptor. Note that many receptors, such as Or42a or Or67b, respond primarily to aliphatic compounds, whereas others, such as Or30a and Or59a, respond to aromatic compounds. (b) Spatial map of olfactory information in glomeruli of the Drosophila larval brain. The mapping was done by expressing a reporter gene under the control of each of the selected olfactory receptor neurons. The photograph indicates the glomeruli that receive projections from ORNs producing each of the 10 indicated receptor protein types (Or42a, etc.). Also indicated are the odorants to which each receptor responds strongly. Note that with one exception (Or30a and Or45b) each glomerulus has unique sensory capacities. The exception might not be an exception if more olfactory gene expression patterns were tested. Glomeruli sensing odorants that are chemically similar tend to be situated next to one another. For example, the three glomeruli indicated by a blue solid line sense linear aliphatic compounds; those with yellow dashed lines, aromatic compounds.

must make discrimination among odorants possible so that the brain can determine which odorants are present. Otherwise the animal might be feeling at ease and relaxed when it should be running away as fast as possible.

The solution to the first problem is the great variability of the olfactory receptor proteins, both within and between species. The solution to the second problem, the expression of a single olfactory receptor gene per cell, has been shown to involve a remarkable form of epigenetic silencing that assures that thousands of olfactory receptor alleles remain inactive in each ORN. These studies have shown that receptor choice relies on the selective activation of a single olfactory receptor gene from a developmental state in which all olfactory receptor genes are silenced. Activation is triggered by a histone demethylase and a specific adenylate cyclase, both of which are required to derepress the single olfactory receptor locus. The active and inactive genes are spatially segregated within the nucleus, with the inactive genes being buried in heterochromatic foci while the active genes are located in euchromatic domains (see Chapter 8).

The third problem, how the system is wired so the brain can understand which odor has been detected, has been partly answered. First, ORNs that express the same receptor send their axons to the same glomerulus. Thus all cells that respond to the same odorant send processes to the same destination. In mice, a crucial clue about the patterning of the olfactory system came from the discovery that olfactory receptors play two roles in ORNs: odorant binding and, during development, axon guidance. Multiple ORN axons expressing the same receptor are guided to the same glomerulus destination. Each olfactory receptor has a distinct, odorant-independent level of activation that turns on adenylate cyclase, with the varying levels of cAMP turning on CREB-dependent expression of standard axon-guidance molecules, whose graded activity is used to specify targeting to a specific glomerulus.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 22.4

## Sensing the Environment: Touch, Pain, Taste, and Smell

- Mechanoreceptors and pain receptors are gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$or $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels. They are present on specialized terminals at the end of sensory neurons, and convey afferent information to the spinal cord and brain stem.
- Touch sensitivity requires several cytoskeletal and extracellular matrix proteins as well as a gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$channel (Figure 22-32).
- Piezo 1 and 2 are large channel proteins that convert mechanical stimulus directly into cation conductance (Figure 22-34).
- TRPV channels are nociceptors that are activated by a variety of stimuli, including heat and capsaicin. Their molecular structure is similar to the structure of voltage-gated ion channels, and was recently solved by single particle cryoEM (Figure 22-33).
- Five primary tastes are sensed by subsets of cells in each taste bud. Salty and sour tastes are detected by specific ion channel proteins, and G protein-coupled receptors detect sweetness, umami, and bitterness.
- In all cases, tastants lead to membrane depolarization and secretion of small molecules such as ATP that stimulate the adjacent neurons. Some tastant GPCRs are found in different homo- and heterodimeric combinations to detect different tastes (see Figure 22-35).
- Taste is represented in a topographic map in a part of the cortex called the insula. Activation of taste receptors by a specific type of taste (e.g., sweet or salty) activates neurons in specific, nonoverlapping regions of the insula.
- Odorant receptors, which are seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors, are encoded by a very large set of genes. Any one olfactory receptor neuron expresses one and only one olfactory receptor gene, so a signal from that cell to the brain unambiguously conveys the nature of the chemical sensed.
- ORNs that express the same receptor gene send their axons to the same glomerulus, and projection nerves (mitral neurons in mammals) carry odorant-specific information from the glomeruli to the brain (see Figures 22-37, 22-38, and 22-39).


### 22.5 Forming and Storing Memories

One of the most remarkable features of the brain is its capacity to form and store memories. Decades of research have revealed that memories are stored as changes in the strength and number of connections that form between
neurons. While the overall structure of the nervous system is genetically hardwired, neural circuits undergo extensive sculpting and rewiring in response to a variety of stimuli. This process of experience-dependent changes in synaptic connectivity is called synaptic plasticity. By modifying brain wiring in response to experiences, synaptic plasticity provides a biological means of integrating nature and nurture to determine our identities.

## Memories Are Formed by Changing the Number or Strength of Synapses Between Neurons

The concept of synaptic plasticity has a long history, beginning with the neuroanatomical studies of Santiago Ramón y Cajal at the turn of the nineteenth century. He used a method called the Golgi stain to visualize individual neurons in the brains of humans and other animals (Figure 22-40a). The Golgi stain was developed by the Italian scientist Camillo Golgi, with whom Ramón y Cajal shared the 1906 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on the structure of the nervous system. While Golgi believed that the brain consisted of an "reticular network," a large syncytium of interconnected nerve cells, Ramón y Cajal recognized that the brain consisted of individual neurons that interacted with one another at sites of contact-what we now know of as synapses. Ramón y Cajal detected synapses as small dendritic protuberances. These protuberances are the postsynaptic compartments of excitatory synapses, and can be visualized not only with the Golgi stain but also with more modern methods based on genetic expression of fluorescent proteins such as GFP (Figure 22-40b). Based on his histological data, Ramón y Cajal hypothesized that memories were stored in the brain by changing the structure of the neuronal arbor and by changing the structure and number of synapses that formed between neurons. In poetic terms, Ramón y Cajal speculated that: "the cerebral cortex is like a garden full of innumerable trees, the pyramidal cells, which in response to intelligent cultivation can increase the number of their branches... and produce ever more varied flowers and fruit."

Decades of research have largely validated Ramón y Cajal's predictions, although memories are now thought to be stored primarily as changes in the synapses ("flowers and fruit") rather than by changes in dendrites and axons ("branches"). Studies of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the sea slug Aplysia californica provide a classic demonstration of the structural basis of memory storage (Figure 22-41). Aplysia californica is a useful model organism for studying the cell biology of memory because its nervous system is relatively simple and its neurons are very large and identifiable, which means that the same neuron can be identified from one animal to another. These features allowed Nobel laureate Eric Kandel and his colleagues to delineate the neural circuitry underlying specific behaviors in the animal, and to then determine how the synaptic connections between neurons in this circuit changed during memory

FIGURE 22-40 Visualizing dendritic spines. (a) Santiago Ramón y Cajal used the Golgi staining method to visualize individual neurons in the cerebellum of a pigeon in 1899. This method permitted Ramón y Cajal to visualize individual neurons in the brain; the tissue is densely packed with neurons but the Golgi stain only labels sparse neurons in the tissue. Using this approach, he argued that the brain was composed of individual neurons that communicated with each other at sites of contact. The postsynaptic compartment of excitatory synapses consists of a spiny protuberance from the dendrite, called a spine. Ramón y Cajal detected these spines in neurons (here in the Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum) and hypothesized that memories
formation. They focused on a simple reflexive behavior, the siphon gill-withdrawal reflex, in which touching the siphon (a tubelike anatomical structure that water flows through) of the animal leads to a defensive withdrawal of its respiratory organ, the gill. Sensory neurons from the siphon that synapse onto motor neurons to the gill mediate the reflex. Touching the siphon triggers firing of the sensory neuron, which triggers an action potential in the motor neuron, which in turn synapses on the gill muscle and causes it to contract. The reflex can be bidirectionally modified by experience. Repeated touching of the siphon leads to a decrease in the amplitude of the gill-withdrawal reflex, called habituation. In contrast, presentation of a noxious stimulus like delivery of an electric shock to the tail leads to an increase in the amplitude of the gill-withdrawal reflex, called sensitization. Sensitization can be thought of as a form of fear learning. Habituation and sensitization can be transient or long lasting, depending on the strength and duration of the stimulus. Long-lasting forms of habituation and sensitization were found to involve dramatic decreases and increases,

![li16635345559](li16635345559.jpg)
could be stored as changes in the number and shape of the spines. In modern-day approaches, fluorescent proteins can be delivered using a microelectrode or expressed genetically to allow visualization of a single neuron in tissue. (b) A red fluorescent dye is delivered to a single Purkinje neuron in mouse cerebellum by a microelectrode and is visualized by two-photon microscopy. At higher resolution, one can image spine dynamics using time-lapse microscopy, and in this way directly demonstrate changes in synaptic connectivity with experience. In this image, a second electrode filled with a red fluorescent dye is used to stimulate synapses forming onto the labeled neurons. (Part (a) Science Source.

respectively, in the number of connections that formed between sensory and motor neurons. In this way, just as Ramón y Cajal predicted, the animal's experience changed the wiring of its nervous system, thereby encoding a memory and changing the animal's behavior.

## The Hippocampus Is Required for Memory Formation

Studies in Aplysia and in other model organisms, including Drosophila melanogaster and mice, have begun to reveal many of the molecular mechanisms underlying experiencedependent synaptic plasticity. Clinical studies in humans as well as experimental studies in animals have shown that the hippocampus is required for the formation of long-term memories. Humans and animals with lesions in their hippocampus can form short-term memories and maintain their old memories, but are no longer able to form new long-term memories. Not only is the hippocampus critical for long-term memory formation, but its anatomy also makes it especially

![li16735345559](li16735345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-41 Long-term memories are stored as changes in synaptic connectivity. (a) The sea slug Aplysia californica is a model system for studying the cell biology of synaptic plasticity and memory. Tactile stimulation of the siphon (a tubelike structure through which water flows) stimulates the gill-withdrawal reflex. In habituation, the siphon is repeatedly touched, which habituates the animal to this stimulation and reduces the amplitude of the gill withdrawal. In sensitization, the animal receives a noxious stimulus like a tail shock, which sensitizes the reflex so that the gill-withdrawal amplitude is enhanced. (b) Stereological reconstructions of siphon sensory neurons from control animals and from animals that have undergone long-term sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex. Notice the expansion of the sensory neuron branches after sensitization. The growth of neuronal processes is accompanied by a growth of new synaptic connections between the sensory and motor neurons. (c) Illustrations showing the changes in connectivity that occur during plasticity of the gill-withdrawal reflex. Sensitization is accompanied by the growth of new connections between the sensory and motor neuron, while habituation is accompanied by a decrease in the number of connections between the sensory and motor neuron. [Part (b) from Bailey C. H., et al., "Long-term memory in Aplysia modulates the total number of varicosities of single identified sensory neurons." Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 1988, 85:2373-2377]
suitable for electrophysiological studies of synaptic connectivity. As shown in Figure 22-42, the hippocampus consists of three sequential pathways (perforant, mossy fiber, and Schaffer collateral pathways), each with discrete cell body layers and axonal and dendritic projections. High-frequency
stimulation of the axons of presynaptic neurons in each of these pathways produces a long-lasting strengthening of the connections onto the postsynaptic neurons, called long-term potentiation (LTP), while low-frequency stimulation produces a long-lasting weakening of the connections, called long-term depression (LTD).

While a multitude of studies have shown correlations between LTP, LTD, and memory, in 2013, optogenetic studies succeeded in demonstrating a causal role for synaptic plasticity in producing memories. To do this, the investigators expressed channelrhodopsin in hippocampal neurons in mice and stimulated the neurons with light to induce LTP. Induction of LTP caused the mice to acquire a false memory in which they demonstrated fear to an environment even though they had never encountered a frightening stimulus in that environment!

## Multiple Molecular Mechanisms Contribute to Synaptic Plasticity

In considering how experience can change synaptic strength, it is useful to think about the structure of the chemical synapse and the process of synaptic transmission described in Section 22.3. Long-lasting changes in plasticity have been shown to involve presynaptic changes in neurotransmitter release, trans-synaptic adhesion, and postsynaptic responses to neurotransmitter. We will briefly touch on pre- and transsynaptic mechanisms and then delve into slightly more detail with postsynaptic mechanisms, which have been studied in greater depth.

Experiences that stimulate hippocampal neurons trigger elevations in intracellular calcium, which in turn activates kinases that phosphorylate synapsins, the molecules that organize synaptic vesicles into discrete pools within the presynaptic compartment. This phosphorylation of synapsin increases the number of synaptic vesicles available for release, thereby increasing the amount of neurotransmitter that is released with a given stimulus. Experience also activates kinases that phosphorylate RIM, the molecule that tethers voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels to the release machinery, and this phosphorylation is required for LTP of hippocampal synapses.

Experience-dependent changes in trans-synaptic molecules can also affect plasticity. Hippocampal learning tasks have been shown to increase the addition of polysialic acid moieties to the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (NCAM) at synapses. Increased polysialylation of NCAM decreases its homophilic adhesion, which is thought to be necessary for new synaptic remodeling and growth.

Synaptic plasticity also depends on activation of kinases in the postsynaptic compartment. Influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, through voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels and specific glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, activates one particularly important kinase, the calcium-calmodulin-dependent kinase $\mathrm{II} \alpha$, (CamKII $\alpha$, see Chapter 15 for discussion of calcium calmodulin signaling). This kinase has the special property that once activated, it can remain persistently activated even

![li16835345559](li16835345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-42 Synaptic plasticity in the mouse hippocampus: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). (a) The mouse hippocampus can be dissected from mouse brain cut into transverse slices, preserving the three sequential synaptic pathways. In the perforant pathway, axons from the entorhinal cortex project to form synapses on dendrites of dentate granule cells (green circles); in the mossy fiber pathway, dentate granule axons synapse on CA3 pyramidal neuron (red triangles) dendrites; and in the Schaffer collateral pathway, CA3 axons synapse on CA1 pyramidal neuron (red triangles) dendrites. The dentate granule cells (green) and the CA3 and CA1
in the absence of stimulation. This is because once activated, CamKII $\alpha$ autophosphorylates itself, which renders it constitutively active for about 30 minutes, during which time the kinase phosphorylates many substrates in the postsynaptic compartment, including glutamate receptors. Phosphorylation of glutamate receptors regulates their conductance and their localization, as described below. Mice lacking CamKII $\alpha$ have deficits in both LTP in the hippocampus and in memory formation.

As discussed in Chapter 15, the sensitivity of a cell to external signals is determined by the number of surface receptors. In line with this concept, one of the best-characterized mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity involves activitydependent changes in the number of glutamate receptors that are present in the postsynaptic membrane. This process has been especially well studied in the context of hippocampal LTP and LTD (Figure 22-43). One of the major classes of glutamate receptors, called AMPA receptors, traffic constitutively to and from the plasma membrane via recycling
![li16935345559](li16935345559.jpg)
pyramidal cell bodies (red) form discrete somatic layers projecting axons and dendrites into defined pathways. Electrodes can be used to stimulate axonal afferents and record from postsynaptic follower cells, as illustrated for the Schaffer collateral (CA3-CA1) pathway. (b) Trains of low-frequency stimulation or high-frequency stimulation to the axonal fibers produce sustained decreases or increases in synaptic strength, which are measured as the postsynaptic response to a test stimulus. These forms of plasticity are known as long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP). See V. M. Ho, J. A. Lee, and K. C. Martin, 2011, Science 334:623-628.
endosomes. AMPA receptors are delivered by exocytosis at extrasynaptic sites and then laterally diffuse into the postsynaptic density, the protein-dense region of the postsynaptic site that faces the synaptic cleft and thus receives neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic terminal. AMPA receptors are removed by endocytosis, which occurs when the receptors diffuse laterally to extrasynaptic sites and are then internalized by clathrin-mediated, dynamindependent endocytosis.

While AMPA receptor trafficking occurs under basal conditions, it is modulated by activity through changes in actin and myosin dynamics as well as AMPA receptor interactions with scaffolding proteins and accessory subunits. One of these accessory subunits, Stargazin, mediates the interaction between AMPA receptors and the postsynaptic density protein PSD95. This interaction is critical to the localization of AMPA receptors at the synapse, since interaction with PSD95 stabilizes AMPA receptor localization within the postsynaptic density. Activity causes the phosphorylation

![li17035345559](li17035345559.jpg)

FIGURE 22-43 AMPA glutamate receptor trafficking during hippocampal LTP and LTD. (a) In the basal state, AMPA receptors (black) traffic constitutively to and from the plasma membrane of the postsynaptic compartment via recycling endosomes. Receptors are delivered to the plasma membrane lateral to the postsynaptic density via exocytosis, and are internalized by clathrin-mediated endocytosis into recycling endosomes. In the postsynaptic density, the AMPA receptors are stabilized by interactions with proteins, including transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPS, not shown). (b) Following induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) at glutamatergic synapses, there is an increase in the exocytosis of AMPA receptors and an increase in their diffusion into the postsynaptic density. This results in an increase in the number of AMPA receptors
on the postsynaptic membrane, and an increase in the postsynaptic response to a given amount of glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron. (c) Following induction of long-term depression (LTD) of glutamatergic synapses, there is an increase in the diffusion of AMPA receptors out of the postsynaptic density and in their internalization into recycling endosomes. This results in a decrease in the number of AMPA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, and a decrease in the postsynaptic response to a given amount of glutamate release from the presynaptic neuron. Regulated trafficking of AMPA receptors provides one molecular mechanism underlying the activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength that accompany synaptic plasticity and memory. See J. D. Shepherd and R. L. Huganir, 2007, Ann. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 23:613-643.
of Stargazin, decreasing the mobility of AMPA receptors and increasing their concentrations at the synapse. Blocking Stargazin phosphorylation or dephosphorylation blocks hippocampal LTP and LTD, respectively. Stargazin is one of a family of transmembrane AMPA receptor regulatory proteins (TARPs). TARPs bind to all AMPA receptor subunits, are differentially expressed throughout the brain, and mediate the delivery of AMPA receptors to the surface and synapse of neurons.

## Formation of Long-Term Memories Requires Gene Expression

The mechanisms described above are especially important for short-term forms of plasticity that underlie short-term memories. While the formation of short-term plasticity, and short-term memory, have been shown to rely on modifications of preexisting proteins at the synapse, the formation of long-term memories differs in that it depends upon new gene expression. This can be thought of in the context of the different effects of extracellular stimulation that were discussed in Chapter 15: stimuli can produce short-term changes by altering the activity of preexisting enzymes and proteins in the cell, or long-term functional changes by altering the
expression of genes in the cell (see Figure 15-1). Studies in many systems and species, including in rodent hippocampus, have demonstrated that LTP and LTD can be divided into transient forms of plasticity that do not require gene expression and Long-lasting forms (L-LTP and L-LTD), that require both mRNA and protein synthesis.

The extreme morphological polarity and compartmentalization of neurons adds significant challenges to stimulus-induced changes in gene expression. First, to turn on transcription, signals must be relayed to the nucleus from the synapse, which in many cases is located at great distances from the cell body. Neurons are specialized for rapid signaling between compartments by electrical signaling, and indeed, action potentials can trigger opening of voltage-gated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels in the cell body, and rapid signaling from the somatic plasma membrane to the nucleus. However, many studies have also shown that signaling molecules, including kinases, phosphatases, and transcriptional regulators, are actively transported from stimulated synapses to the nucleus to regulate transcription. In most cases, this long-distance retrograde transport has been shown to involve dynein motor protein-mediated transport along microtubules (as described in Chapter 18). How signaling is faithfully maintained during this long-distance transport in order to

couple synaptic stimulation with gene expression is an area of active research.

The second great challenge in understanding the mechanism of stimulus-induced gene expression during synaptic plasticity derives from the fact that each neuron has a single nucleus and yet can form thousands of synapses. Long-lasting forms of synaptic plasticity are often "synapse-specific," that is, they involve changes in synaptic strength at some but not all synapses formed by a single neuron. Since long-term plasticity requires transcription, synapse specificity begs the question of how gene expression can be spatially regulated in such a highly compartmentalized cell. One important mechanism involves the localization of mRNAs and their local translation in response to synaptic stimulation, as was discussed in Chapter 10. Indeed, L-LTP of hippocampal synapses has been shown to require the translation of mRNAs that are localized in dendrites and at synapses. Electron micrographic studies have identified polyribosomes, actively translating ribosomes, at the base of spines in hippocampal neurons, and have further shown that the number of spines controlling polyribosomes greatly increases after induction of L-LTP. Together, these studies have focused attention on the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in neurons during synaptic plasticity, and on a host of questions about mRNA localization and regulated translation: What mRNAs are localized to synapses? How are they localized? How is their translation regulated by synaptic activity? What is the specific function of the locally translated protein? Why are some mRNAs translated into protein in the neuronal cell body and then transported to synapses, and others translated directly at synapses?

$\square$Indicative of the importance of post-transcriptional gene regulation in the proper functioning of the nervous system, mutations in an RNA-binding protein, the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, cause a common form of mental retardation, fragile X syndrome (FXS), and also constitute the most common single-gene cause of autism. The most common mutations that lead to FXS are expansions of CGG repeats in the FMRP gene that leads to gene methylation and silencing, as was described for Huntington's disease in Chapter 6. FMRP is a translational repressor that binds target mRNA and prevents its translation. A population of FMRP localizes to the base of dendritic spines, where it is thought to maintain mRNAs in a dormant state until synaptic stimulation triggers their translation. Genetically modified mice that lack FMRP serve as remarkably good models for the human disease. The mice show deficits in learning, reflective of the intellectual disability in FXS patients. Both mice and humans have abnormalities in the structure of their synaptic spines, which are elongated, like immature spines, rather than stubby, like mature spines. Studies in the mouse have revealed excessive basal translation of mRNAs at synapses and have further shown alterations in protein-synthesis-dependent forms of hippocampal LTD. Together, these findings indicate that synaptic
translation of localized mRNAs is critical to the formation and the experience-dependent plasticity of neural circuits, and that alterations in this process are a cause of neurodevelopmental and cognitive disorders.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 22.5

## Forming and Storing Memories

- Experience changes the number and strength of connections between neurons in the brain through a process known as synaptic plasticity. Synaptic plasticity provides a biological basis for the formation and storage of memories.
- Studies of habituation and sensitization of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the marine mollusk Aplysia californica demonstrated that learning produces changes in synaptic connectivity. Habituation involves decreases in the connectivity of the sensory and motor neurons that give rise to the gill-withdrawal reflex, while sensitization involves increases in sensory-motor connectivity (Figure 22-41)
- The hippocampus is a region of the brain that is required for the formation of long-lasting memories (Figure 22-42). Hippocampal synapses undergo activity-dependent forms of synaptic strengthening called long-term potentiation (LTP) and activity-dependent forms of synaptic weakening called long-term depression (LTD).
- Changes in synaptic strength can be mediated by presynaptic, trans-synaptic, or postsynaptic mechanisms.
- Activity generates a constitutively active form of CamKII $\alpha$ in the postsynaptic compartment, which phosphorylates substrates in the postsynaptic density, including glutamate receptors. Mice lacking CamKII $\alpha$ have defects in hippocampal LTP and memory.
- Activity regulates the trafficking of AMPA glutamate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane. LTP is accompanied by an increase in insertion of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic density, while LTD is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic density (Figure 22-43).
- Short-term forms of synaptic plasticity involve changes in preexisting proteins at the synapses, but long-term forms require new mRNA and protein synthesis.
- Synapse-specific forms of plasticity involve the local translation of synaptically localized mRNAs.
- Fragile X syndrome is caused by null mutations in the gene encoding the RNA-binding protein FMRP. FMRP regulates local translation at synapses. Mice lacking FMRP have abnormal synapses and exhibit learning impairments and deficits in hippocampal LTD.

Immunity is a state of protection against the harmful effects of exposure to pathogens. Host defenses can take many different forms, and all pathogens have found ways to disarm the immune system or manipulate it to their own advantage. Host-pathogen interactions are therefore an evolutionary work in progress. This explains why, despite the evolution of remarkably sophisticated immune systems, pathogenic viruses, bacteria, and parasites continue to pose a threat to human populations. The prevalence of infectious diseases illustrates the imperfections of host defenses. Virtually all pathogens have relatively short generation times compared with the hosts they infect and thus can quickly evolve sophisticated countermeasures against their hosts' immune system. Seasonal outbreaks of influenza caused by new strains of influenza virus are just one example.

The portion of the immune system that can make adjustments to these threats over time, called the adaptive immune system, changes in response to changing types and abundances of pathogens. Another portion of the immune

system, called the innate immune system, serves as the rapid deployment force to deal with invaders. Such sophisticated defenses come at a price: an immune system capable of dealing with a massively diverse collection of rapidly evolving pathogens can sometimes mistake the host's own tissues for pathogens and mount an attack against its own cells and tissues, a phenomenon called autoimmunity. Even so, we have learned to exploit the workings of the immune system to create vaccines that protect against a variety of infectious diseases. Vaccines are remarkably cost-effective and have contributed to eliminating the scourge of epidemics, such as outbreaks of smallpox.

Host defenses comprise three layers: (1) mechanical and chemical defenses, (2) the innate immune system, and (3) the adaptive immune system (Figure 23-1). Mechanical and chemical defenses operate continuously. Innate immune responses, which involve cells and molecules that are present at all times, are rapidly activated (in minutes to hours), but their ability to distinguish among different pathogens is

FIGURE 23-1 The three layers of vertebrate immune defenses. Left: Mechanical defenses consist of epithelia and skin. Chemical defenses include the low pH of the gastric environment and antibacterial enzymes in tears. These barriers provide continuous protection against invaders. Pathogens must physically breach these defenses (step $\mathbf{E}$ to infect the host. Middle: Pathogens that have breached the mechanical and chemical defenses (step $\mathbf{E}$ are handled by cells and molecules of the innate immune system (blue), which includes phagocytic cells (neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages), natural killer (NK) cells, complement proteins, and certain interleukins (IL-1, IL-6).
somewhat limited. In contrast, adaptive immune responses take several days to develop fully and are highly specific; that is, they can distinguish between closely related pathogens based on very small molecular differences in their structure.

In this chapter, we deal mainly with the vertebrate immune system, with particular emphasis on those molecules, cell types, and pathways that uniquely distinguish the immune system from other types of cells and tissues. Four remarkable features that characterize the vertebrate immune system are specificity, diversity, memory, and tolerance. Specificity is the immune system's ability to distinguish between closely related substances. Diversity is the system's capacity to specifically recognize an astoundingly large number ( $>10^{6}$ ) of different molecules. Memory is a host's ability to recall previously experienced exposure to a foreign substance and more rapidly and effectively defend itself from that substance the next time it is encountered. Tolerance is the ability to avoid mounting an immune-system attack against the host's own cells and tissues. As we shall see, the immune system achieves

Innate defenses are activated within minutes to hours of infection. Right: Pathogens that are not cleared by the innate immune system are dealt with by the adaptive immune system (step $\mathbf{E}$ ), in particular B and T lymphocytes. Full activation of adaptive immunity requires days. The products of an innate response may potentiate an ensuing adaptive response (step $\mathbf{E}$ ). Likewise, the products of an adaptive immune response, including antibodies ( $Y$-shaped icons), may enhance innate immunity (step $\mathbf{E}$ ). Several cell types and secreted products straddle the fence between the innate and adaptive immune systems and serve to connect these two layers of host defense.
specificity and diversity by generating a large number of distinct proteins, such as antibodies and specific cell-surface receptors, each of which can bind very tightly to a target pathogenic molecule, but not to other, perhaps structurally very similar, molecules. Memory and tolerance depend on complex cellular systems we will describe. They are accomplished through the generation of a massively diverse set of cell-surface receptors that bind specific antigens. These receptors have been "trained" to recognize self molecules and are largely unresponsive to self components (self-tolerant).

From a practical perspective, the powers of the immune system can be exploited therapeutically. Today there is a multibillion-dollar market for monoclonal antibodies, which are used in the successful treatment of inflammatory conditions, autoimmune diseases, and cancer. The molecules that constitute the adaptive immune system—antibodies in particular-are also indispensable tools for the cell biologist, as we saw in Chapters 3 and 4. Antibodies allow the visualization and isolation of the molecules they recognize with

pinpoint precision. Their ability to do so has been invaluable in the accurate description of the components that make up the cell and its organelles and their localization, both in cells and in tissues. The technique of immunofluorescence, for example, is widely used by cell biologists to study cell morphology and behavior, while immunoblotting (Western blotting) has become an indispensable tool in the study of signal transduction.

Any material that can evoke an immune response is referred to as an antigen. The ways in which these foreign materials are recognized and eliminated involve molecular and cell biological principles unique to the immune system. We begin this chapter with a brief sketch of the organization of the mammalian immune system, introducing the essential players in innate and adaptive immune responses and describing inflammation, a localized response to injury or infection that leads to the activation of immune-system cells and their recruitment to the affected site. In the next two sections, we discuss the structure and function of antibody (or immunoglobulin) molecules, which bind to specific molecular features on antigens, and how variability in antibody structure contributes to the recognition of specific antigens. The enormous diversity of antigens that can be recognized by the adaptive immune system finds its explanation in unique rearrangements of the genetic material in B and T lymphocytes, commonly called B cells and T cells, which are the white blood cells that carry out antigen-specific recognition. These gene rearrangements permit adaptation to a wide variety of pathogens by altering the specificity of antigenbinding receptors on lymphocytes; they also determine cell fate in the course of lymphocyte development.

Although the gene rearrangement mechanisms that give rise to antigen-specific receptors on B and T cells are very similar, the manner in which these receptors bind to (recognize) antigens is very different. The receptors on B cells can interact with intact antigens directly, but the receptors on T cells cannot. Instead, as described in Section 23.4, the receptors on T cells recognize processed forms of antigen cleaved into small peptides, then displayed or "presented" on the surfaces of target cells by specialized cell-surface glycoproteins. These glycoproteins are encoded by genes in a region of the genome called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). These MHC-encoded glycoproteins, also called MHC products, help determine the host's ability to mount both T-cell and B-cell responses to antigens.

Understanding these fundamental properties of the immune system has allowed us to answer a number of very practical questions: How can we best make antibodies that afford protection against an infectious agent? How can we raise antibodies to specific proteins we want to study in the laboratory? Knowledge of antigen processing and presentation thus informs both vaccine design to protect against infectious disease and the generation of tools essential for research. MHC-encoded glycoproteins also play a key role in an individual's development of tolerance for his or her own antigens. We conclude the chapter with an integrated view of the immune response to a pathogen, highlighting the
collaboration between different immune-system cells that is required for an effective immune response.

### 23.1 Overview of Host Defenses

Because the immune system evolves in the presence of microbes, some of them pathogens, we begin our overview of host defenses by examining where typical pathogens are found and where they replicate. Then we introduce the basic concepts of innate and adaptive immunity, including some of the key cellular and molecular players.

## Pathogens Enter the Body Through Different Routes and Replicate at Different Sites

Exposure to pathogens occurs via different routes. The human skin itself has a surface area of some 20 square feet; the epithelial surfaces that line the airways, gastrointestinal tract, and genital tract present an even more formidable surface area of about 4000 square feet. All these surfaces are exposed on a daily basis to viruses and bacteria in the environment. Some of these bacteria, called commensal bacteria, do not usually cause disease and in fact can be beneficial, helping to provide key nutrients or to maintain healthy skin. It is thought that at any point in time, an adult human may be carrying as much as 3 pounds of microbes, against which most of us do not develop an overt inflammatory reaction. These commensal microbes are not pathogenic as long as they remain on these outer surfaces of the body. If the normal barrier function of the epithelia that compose these surfaces is compromised, however, and these microbes enter the body, they can be pathogenic. Food-borne pathogens and sexually transmitted agents target the epithelia to which they are exposed. The sneeze of a flu-infected individual releases millions of virus particles in aerosolized form, ready for inhalation by a new host. Rupture of the skin, even if only by minor abrasions, or of the epithelial barriers that protect the underlying tissues provides an easy route of entry for pathogens, which then gain access to a rich source of nutrients (for bacteria) and to the cells required for replication (for viruses).

Replication of viruses is confined strictly to the cytoplasm or nuclei of host cells, where viral protein synthesis and replication of the viral genetic material occur. Viruses can then spread to other cells either as free virus particles (virions) released from the initially infected cell or by direct transfer to an adjacent cell (cell-to-cell spreading). Many bacteria can replicate in the extracellular spaces of the body, but some are specialized to invade host cells and survive and reproduce within those cells. Such intracellular bacteria reside either in the membrane-delimited vesicles through which they enter cells by endocytosis or phagocytosis (see Figure 17-19) or in the cytoplasm if they escape from these vesicles. An effective host defense system, therefore, needs to be capable of eliminating not only extracellular viruses and bacteria, but also host cells that harbor these pathogens.

Parasitic eukaryotes can also cause disease. Some of these parasites, such as the protozoans that cause sleeping sickness (trypanosomes) or malaria (Plasmodium species), have very complex life cycles and have evolved complex countermeasures to avoid destruction by the host's immune system.

## Leukocytes Circulate Throughout the Body and Take Up Residence in Tissues and Lymph Nodes

The circulatory system (Figure 23-2) is responsible for moving blood throughout the body. Blood comprises cells (red and white blood cells, platelets) and liquid (plasma, which contains dissolved substances including proteins, ions, and small molecules). In addition to the hemoglobin-containing, oxygen-carrying erythrocytes (red blood cells) that compose the overwhelming majority of blood cells, the blood also contains leukocytes (white blood cells) and platelets (involved in blood clotting). Leukocytes encompass a variety of cell types, including lymphocytes ( B and T cells), monocytes (precursors to the scavenger cells called macrophages), dendritic cells, neutrophils, and natural killer (NK) cells, all of which have distinct functions in the immune system. In contrast to erythrocytes, which never leave the circulation until they get old and die, leukocytes leave the circulation and enter target tissues to help protect the body from invaders. The circulatory system moves leukocytes from the sites where they are generated (bone marrow, thymus, fetal liver) to the sites where they can be activated (lymph nodes, spleen), and then to the site of infection. Once leukocytes arrive at a given location, they may leave and re-enter the circulation in the course of their tasks.

The immune system, an interconnected system of vessels, organs, and cells, can be divided into primary and secondary lymphoid organs (see Figure 23-2). Primary lymphoid organs-the sites at which lymphocytes (the subset of leukocytes that includes B and T cells) are generated and acquire their functional properties-include the thymus, where T cells are generated, and the bone marrow, where B cells are generated. Adaptive immune responses, which require functionally competent lymphocytes, are initiated in secondary lymphoid organs, which include lymph nodes and the spleen. All of the cells within lymphoid organs are derived from hematopoietic stem cells (see Figure 21-19), generated initially in the fetal liver and subsequently in the bone marrow. The total number of lymphocytes in a young adult male human is estimated to be $500 \times 10^{9}$. Roughly 15 percent of these cells are found in the spleen, 40 percent in the other secondary lymphoid organs (tonsils, lymph nodes), 10 percent in the thymus, and 10 percent in the bone marrow; the remainder circulate in the bloodstream.

In normal circumstances, the pressure exerted by the pumping heart not only drives transport of the blood within blood vessels, but also forces cell-free liquid across blood vessel walls into the underlying tissue. This liquid delivers both nutrients and proteins, some of which carry out defensive functions. Its volume is up to three times the total blood volume. To maintain homeostasis, the fluid that leaves the circulation must ultimately return, and it does so in the form
![li17335345559](li17335345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-2 The circulatory and lymphatic systems. Positive arterial pressure exerted by the pumping heart is responsible for the movement of liquid from the circulatory system (red) into the interstitial spaces of the tissues, so that all cells of the body have access to nutrients and can dispose of waste. This interstitial fluid, whose volume is roughly three times that of all blood in the circulation, is returned to the circulation in the form of lymph, which passes through specialized anatomic structures called lymph nodes. The primary lymphoid organs, where lymphocytes are generated, are the bone marrow ( B cells, T-cell precursors) and the thymus (T cells). The initiation of an immune response involves the secondary lymphoid organs (lymph nodes, spleen).
of $l y m p h$, via lymphatic vessels. At their most distal ends, lymphatic vessels are open to collect the interstitial fluid that bathes the cells in tissues. The lymphatic vessels merge into larger collecting vessels, which deliver lymph to lymph nodes (Figure 23-3). A lymph node consists of a capsule organized into areas that are defined by the cell types that inhabit them. Blood vessels entering a lymph node deliver B and T cells to it. The lymph that arrives in a lymph node carries cells that have encountered ("sampled") antigens, as well as soluble antigens, from the tissue drained by that particular afferent lymphatic vessel. In the lymph node, the cells and molecules required for the adaptive immune response interact, respond to the newly acquired antigenic information, and then execute the necessary steps to rid the body of the pathogen (see Figure 23-3).

![li17435345559](li17435345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-3 Initiation of the adaptive immune response in lymph nodes. Recognition of antigen by B and T cells (lymphocytes) located in lymph nodes initiates an adaptive immune response. Lymphocytes leave the circulation and take up residence in lymph nodes (step 1). Lymph carries antigen in two forms, soluble antigen and antigen-laden dendritic cells; both are delivered to lymph nodes via afferent lymphatic

Lymph nodes can be thought of as filters in which antigenic information gathered from distal sites throughout the body is collected and displayed to the immune system in a form suitable to evoke a response. All the relevant steps that lead to activation of a resting lymphocyte take place in lymphoid organs. Cells that have received proper instructions to become functionally active leave the lymph node via efferent lymphatic vessels that ultimately return lymph to the bloodstream. Such activated cells recirculate through the bloodstream and—now ready for action-may reach a location where they again leave the circulation in response to chemotactic cues, move into tissues, and seek out pathogenic invaders, destroy virus-infected cells, or produce the antibodies that recognize and tag the invaders for destruction.

The exit of lymphocytes and other leukocytes from the circulation, the recruitment of these cells to sites of infection, the processing of antigenic information, and the return of immune-system cells to the circulation are all carefully regulated processes that involve specific cell-adhesion events, chemotactic cues, and the crossing of endothelial barriers, as we will see later in this chapter.
vessels (steps 1 and 2). Soluble antigen is recognized by B cells (step 3), and antigen-laden dendritic cells present antigen to T cells (step 4). Productive interactions between T and B cells (step 5) allow B cells to move into follicles and differentiate into plasma cells, which produce large amounts of secreted immunoglobulins (antibodies). Efferent lymphatic vessels return lymph from the lymph node to the circulation.

## Mechanical and Chemical Boundaries Form a First Layer of Defense Against Pathogens

As noted already, mechanical and chemical defenses form the first line of host defense against pathogens (see Figure 23-1). Mechanical defenses, which operate continuously, include skin, epithelia, and arthropod exoskeletons, all barriers that can be breached only by mechanical damage or through specific enzymatic attack. Chemical defenses include the low pH found in gastric secretions as well as enzymes such as lysozyme, found in tears and in intestinal secretions, that can attack microbes directly.

The essential nature of mechanical defenses is immediately obvious in the case of burn victims. When the integrity of the skin (epidermis and dermis) is compromised, the rich source of nutrients in the underlying tissues is exposed, and airborne bacteria or otherwise harmless commensal bacteria found on the skin can multiply unchecked, ultimately overwhelming the host. Viruses and bacteria have evolved strategies to breach the integrity of these physical barriers. Enveloped viruses such as HIV, rabies virus, and influenza virus possess membrane proteins endowed with fusogenic properties. Following adhesion

of a virion to the surface of the cell to be infected, direct fusion of the viral membrane with the host cell's plasma membrane results in delivery of the viral genetic material into the host cytoplasm, where it is now available for transcription, translation, and replication (see Figures 5-46 and 5-48). Certain pathogenic bacteria (such as "flesh-eating bacteria," which are highly pathogenic strains of Streptococcus) secrete collagenases that compromise the integrity of connective tissue and so facilitate access of the bacteria to underlying tissue.

## Innate Immunity Provides a Second Line of Defense

The innate immune system is activated once the mechanical and chemical defenses have failed and the presence of an invader is sensed (see Figure 23-1). The innate immune system comprises cells and molecules that are immediately available for responding to pathogens. Phagocytes, cells that ingest and destroy pathogens (see Figure 17-19), are widespread throughout tissues and epithelia and can be recruited to sites of infection. Several soluble proteins that are constitutively present in the blood or produced in response to infection or inflammation also contribute to innate defenses. Animals that lack an adaptive immune system, such as insects, rely exclusively on innate defenses to combat infections. Likewise, plants rely exclusively on innate defenses and lack adaptive immunity altogether.

Phagocytes and Antigen-Presenting Cells The innate immune system includes macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. All of these cells are phagocytic and come equipped with pathogen recognition receptors such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs; see Figure 23-35 below for their molecular structure) and scavenger receptors on their cell surface. These receptors detect broad patterns of pathogen-specific markers, such as bacterial cell-wall constituents or nucleic acids that contain unmethylated CpG or double-stranded RNA, and are thus key sensors for detecting the presence of bacteria or viruses. When these markers bind to TLRs, the cells produce effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides. Dendritic cells and macrophages whose TLRs have detected pathogens also function as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by processing and displaying foreign materials to antigen-specific T cells, thus bridging the innate and adaptive immune systems. The structure and function of TLRs and their role in activating dendritic cells are described in detail in Section 23.6.

Inflammasomes and Non-TLR Nucleic Acid Sensors Mammalian cells possess a family of proteins, endowed with leucine-rich repeats, that are capable of recognizing all manner of nonself components and of perceiving "danger" signals. The molecules recognized by these proteins span a range from components of the bacterial cell wall to uric acid crystals, to heme degradation products, and even to asbestos and silica (Figure 23-4).
![li17535345559](li17535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-4 The NLRP3 inflammasome. The NLRP3 inflammasome activates caspase-1 only after receiving two signals. Signal 1 is provided by microbial antigens recognized via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or by binding of endogenous cytokines such as TNF to the TNF receptor (TNFR). Signal 1 causes the up-regulation of NLRP3 and pro-IL-1 $\beta$. Signal 2, which
activates the NLRP3 inflammasome, can be provided by bacterial poreforming toxins, by influenza virus M2 protein, by fungal particles via the kinase Syk (as shown for Candida albicans), or by cholera toxin (CT). Cytosolic bacterial DNA can also activate the NLRP3 inflammasome, although the molecular details of this mechanism are not yet understood.

Once recognized, these "danger" signals activate the assembly of a multiprotein complex called the inflammasome, which activates the effector proteins involved in inflammation. Proteins that make up the inflammasome contain modules that mediate interactions with adapter proteins that ultimately allow a physical connection with and activation of caspase-1, an enzyme that is critical in the production of cytokines that cause inflammation (a process described below). As we will see in Section 23.6, the inflammasome plays an important role in bridging the innate and adaptive immune response.

Some mammalian TLRs that can recognize bacterial or viral nucleic acids have their ligand-binding domains in the lumen of endosomes. Mammalian cells also possess other sensors capable of detecting the presence of cytosolic nucleic acids. RIG-I and MDA5 are proteins specialized in recognition of viral RNA. Mammalian cells also possess an enzyme, cGAS, that is capable of generating cyclic dinucleotides from bacterial or viral DNA. These cyclic dinucleotides are then recognized by the ER-localized STING protein. Activation of these classes of receptors triggers inflammation and helps initiate an adaptive immune response.

The Complement System Another important component of the innate immune system is the complement system, a collection of serum proteins that can bind directly to microbial or fungal surfaces. This binding activates a proteolytic cascade that culminates in, among other things, the formation of a membrane attack complex, which is capable of forming pores in the pathogen's protective membrane (Figure 23-5). The cascade of complement activation is conceptually similar to the blood-clotting cascade, with amplification of the reaction at each successive stage of activation. At least three distinct pathways can activate the complement system. The classical pathway requires the presence of antibodies produced in the course of an adaptive immune response and bound to their antigens on the surface of the target microbe. How such antibodies are produced will be described below. This complement pathway represents an example of components of the innate immune system acting together with the antibodies produced by adaptive immune system.

In addition to the classical pathway of complement activation, pathogens that contain mannose-rich cell walls activate the complement cascade through the mannose-binding lectin pathway. Mannose-binding lectin binds to distinctive groups of mannose sugars on the surface of the pathogen and then triggers activation of two mannose-binding lectinassociated proteases, MASP-1 and MASP-2, which allow activation of the downstream components of the complement cascade as shown in Figure 23-5. Finally, many microbial surfaces have physical and chemical properties, incompletely understood, that result in activation of complement via the alternative pathway, an activation cascade that includes factors B, D, and P, all proteins found in plasma.

The three pathways converge at the activation of complement protein C3. This protein is synthesized as a precursor that contains an internal, strained thioester linkage between
![li17635345559](li17635345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-5 Three pathways of complement activation.
The classical pathway involves the formation of antibody-antigen complexes. In the mannose-binding lectin pathway, mannose-rich structures found on the surfaces of many pathogens are recognized by mannose-binding lectin. The alternative pathway requires deposition of a special form of the serum protein C3, a major complement component, onto a microbial surface, upstream of which are factors B, D and P. Each of the activation pathways is organized as a cascade of proteases in which the downstream component is itself a protease. Amplification of activity occurs with each successive step. All three pathways converge on C3, which cleaves C5 and thus triggers formation of the membrane attack complex, leading to destruction of target cells. The small fragments of C3 and C5 generated in the course of complement activation initiate inflammation by attracting neutrophils, phagocytic cells that can kill bacteria at short range or upon ingestion.

a cysteine and a glutamate residue in close proximity, requiring a proteolytic conversion to become fully reactive. C 3 is covalently deposited only on antigen-antibody complexes in close proximity to itself. Surfaces that are properly decorated with mannose-binding lectin or that receive C3 deposits via the alternative pathway are similarly targeted. This proximity restriction limits the effects of complement to nearby surfaces, avoiding an inappropriate attack on cells that do not display the antigens targeted.

Regardless of the activation pathway, activated C3 unleashes the terminal components of the complement cascade, complement proteins C5 through C9, culminating in formation of the membrane attack complex, which inserts itself into almost any adjacent biological membrane and renders it permeable by forming a pore. The resulting loss of electrolytes and small solutes leads to lysis and death of the target cell. Whenever complement is activated, the membrane attack complex is formed and results in death of the cell onto which it is deposited. The direct microbe-killing (microbicidal) effect of a fully activated complement cascade is an important mechanism of host defense.

All three complement activation pathways also generate C3a and C5a cleavage fragments, which bind to G proteincoupled receptors and function to attract neutrophils and other cells involved in inflammation. In addition, phagocytic cells, such as macrophages, which recognize cells whose surfaces are covalently labeled with fragments from C3, ingest and destroy those cells.

The complement cascade thus fulfills multiple roles in host defense: it can destroy the membranes that envelope a pathogen (bacteria, viruses); it covalently "paints" the targeted pathogen so that it may be more readily ingested by phagocytic cells capable of killing the pathogen and presenting its contents to cells that will initiate an adaptive immune response; and finally, the act of complement activation yields signals to attract cells of the innate (neutrophils, macrophages, dendritic cells) and adaptive (lymphocytes) immune systems to the site of infection. These cues are called chemotactic signals.

Natural Killer Cells In addition to bacterial and eukaryotic parasitic invaders, the innate immune system also defends against viruses. When the presence of a virus-infected cell is detected, still other cell types of the innate immune system become active, seeking out virus-infected target cells and killing them. For instance, when many types of cells (not just immune-system cells) are infected, they synthesize and secrete a class of proteins called type I interferons that act as intercellular signals, warning the immune system that an infection is present. The interferons are classified as cytokines, small, secreted proteins that help regulate immune responses in a variety of ways. We will encounter other cytokines and discuss some of their receptors as the chapter progresses.

Interferons activate natural killer (NK) cells. Activated NK cells help protect the body in several ways. First, they can kill host cells infected by a virus (hence the name "natural killer"), preventing those infected cells from making additional virus particles that would spread the infection.

Second, NK cells secrete type II interferon $\gamma$, which is essential for orchestrating many other aspects of antiviral defenses (Figure 23-6). Third, NK cells can kill target cells that have been decorated by antibodies. NK cells recognize their targets by means of several classes of surface receptors capable of yielding stimulatory (promoting cell killing) or inhibitory signals.

## Inflammation Is a Complex Response to Injury That Encompasses Both Innate and Adaptive Immunity

When a vascularized tissue (one that is supplied with blood vessels) is injured, the stereotypical response that follows is inflammation. The injury may be a consequence of physical or chemical processes, such as torn muscles, a simple paper cut, or infection with a pathogen. Inflammation, also called the inflammatory response, is characterized by four classic signs: redness, swelling, heat, and pain. These signs are caused by increased leakiness of blood vessels (vasodilation), attraction of immune-system cells to the site of damage, and the production of soluble mediators of inflammation, which are responsible for the sensation of heat and pain. Inflammation provides immediate protection through the activation of the cell types and soluble products that together mount the innate immune response and create a local environment conducive to the initiation of the adaptive immune response. If it is not properly controlled, however, inflammation can also be a major cause of tissue damage.
![li17735345559](li17735345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-6 Natural killer cells. Natural killer (NK) cells are an important source of the cytokine interferon $\gamma$ (IFN- $\gamma$ ), which is involved in antiviral defenses, and can kill virus-infected and cancerous cells directly by means of perforins. These pore-forming proteins allow access to the cytoplasm of the target cell by serine proteases called granzymes. Granzymes can also initiate apoptosis through activation of caspases (see Chapter 21). Receptors on NK cells identify infected or stressed cells and stimulate the NK cell to kill them. Other receptors identify normal cells and inhibit NK cell activation.

Figure 23-7 depicts the key players in the inflammatory response to bacterial pathogens and the subsequent initiation of an adaptive immune response. Tissue-resident dendritic cells sense the presence of pathogens via their TLRs
![li17835345559](li17835345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-7 Interplay of innate and adaptive immune responses to a bacterial pathogen. Once a bacterium breaches the host's mechanical and chemical defenses, the bacterium is exposed to components of the complement cascade, as well as to innate immune-system cells that confer immediate protection (step 1). Various inflammatory proteins induced by tissue damage contribute to a localized inflammatory response. Local destruction of the bacterium results in the release of bacterial antigens, which are delivered, via the afferent lymphatic vessels that drain the tissue, to the lymph nodes (step 2). Dendritic cells acquire antigen at the site of infection, become migratory, and move to the lymph nodes, where they activate T cells (step 3). In the lymph nodes, antigen-stimulated T cells proliferate and acquire effector functions, including the ability to help B cells (step 4), some of which may move to the bone marrow and complete their differentiation into plasma cells there (step 5). In later stages of the immune response, activated T cells provide additional assistance to antigen-experienced B cells to yield plasma cells that secrete antigen-specific antibodies at a high rate (step 6). Antibodies produced as a consequence of the initial exposure to the bacterium act in synergy with complement to eliminate the infection (step 7), should it persist, or afford rapid protection in the case of re-exposure to the same pathogen.
and respond by releasing small soluble proteins such as cytokines and chemokines; the latter act as chemoattractants for immune-system cells. Neutrophils leave the circulation and migrate to the site of injury or infection in response to the cytokines and chemokines produced there (see Figure 20-40). Neutrophils, which constitute almost half of all circulating leukocytes, are phagocytic (see Figure 17-19), directly ingesting and destroying pathogenic bacteria and fungi. Neutrophils can interact with a wide variety of pathogen-derived macromolecules via their TLRs. Engagement of these receptors, described in detail below, activates the neutrophils, which produce more cytokines and chemokines; the latter can attract more leukocytes-neutrophils, macrophages, and ultimately lymphocytes ( T and B cells)to the area to fight the infection. Activated neutrophils can release bacteria-destroying enzymes (e.g., lysozyme and proteases) as well as small peptides with microbicidal activity, collectively called defensins. Activated neutrophils also turn on enzymes that generate the superoxide anion radical and other reactive oxygen species (see Chapter 12, pages 547-548), which can kill microbes at short range. Another cell type that contributes to the inflammatory response is tissue-resident mast cells. When activated by a variety of physical or chemical stimuli, mast cells release histamine, a small molecule that binds to G protein-coupled receptors. This binding leads to increased vascular permeability and thereby facilitates access to the tissue by plasma proteins (such as complement) that can act against the invading pathogen.

A very important early response to infection or injury is the activation of a variety of plasma proteases, including the proteins of the complement cascade discussed above. As we have seen, the cleavage fragments produced during activation of these proteases attract neutrophils to the site of tissue damage (see Figure 23-5). They further induce production of cytokines such as interleukins 1 and 6 (IL-1 and IL-6), which cause inflammation. The recruitment of neutrophils also depends on an increase in vascular permeability, which is controlled in part by lipid signaling molecules (e.g., prostaglandins and leukotrienes) that are derived from phospholipids and fatty acids. All of these events occur rapidly, starting within minutes of injury. A failure to resolve the cause of this immediate response may result in chronic inflammation with ensuing tissue damage, in which cells of the adaptive immune system play an important role.

When the pathogen burden at the site of tissue damage is high, it may exceed the capacity of innate defense mechanisms to deal with the infection. Moreover, some pathogens have acquired, in the course of evolution, tools to disable or bypass innate immune defenses. In such situations, the adaptive immune response is required to help control the infection. This response depends on specialized cells that straddle the interface between adaptive and innate immunity, including macrophages and dendritic cells, which are capable of ingesting and killing pathogens as well as presenting antigens to the adaptive immune system. Dendritic cells, in particular, can initiate an adaptive immune response by delivering newly acquired pathogen-derived antigens to secondary lymphoid organs (see Figure 23-7).

## Adaptive Immunity, the Third Line of Defense, Exhibits Specificity

Adaptive immunity is the term reserved for the highly specific recognition of foreign substances by antigen-specific receptors, the full elaboration of which requires days or weeks after occurrence of the initial exposure. Lymphocytes bearing antigen-specific receptors are the key cells responsible for adaptive immunity. An early indication of the specific nature of adaptive immune responses came with the discovery of antibodies, the key effector molecules of adaptive immunity, by Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato in 1905. They began by transferring serum (the straw-colored liquid that separates from cellular debris upon completion of the blood-clotting process) from guinea pigs exposed to a sublethal dose of the deadly diphtheria toxin to animals never before exposed to the bacterium that produces it. The recipient animals were thus protected against a lethal dose of the same bacterium (Figure 23-8, left). Transfer of serum from animals never exposed to diphtheria toxin failed to protect, and protection was limited to the microbe that produced the
diphtheria toxin and did not extend to other toxins. This experiment demonstrates specificity-that is, the ability to distinguish between two related substances of the same class. Such specificity is a hallmark of the adaptive immune system. Even proteins that differ by a single amino acid may be distinguished by immunological means.

From these experiments, von Behring inferred the existence of transferable factors responsible for protection, which he called "corpuscles" (Antikörper), or antibodies. The antibody-containing sera not only afforded protection in vivo, but also killed microbes in the test tube (Figure 23-8, right). Heating the antibody-containing sera to $56^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ destroyed this killing activity, but it was restored by the addition of unheated fresh serum from naive animals (i.e., animals never exposed to the bacterium). This finding suggested that a second factor (which turned out to be complement) acts in synergy with antibodies to kill bacteria.

We now know that von Behring's antibodies are serum proteins referred to as immunoglobulins and that complement is actually the series of proteases described above, which carry out the destruction of pathogens tagged by
![li17935345559](li17935345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 23-8 The existence of antibody in serum from infected animals was demonstrated by von Behring and Kitasato. Exposure of animals to a sublethal dose of diphtheria toxin (or the bacteria that produce it) elicits in their serum a substance that protects against a subsequent challenge with a lethal dose of the toxin (or the bacteria that produce it). The protective effect of this serum substance can be transferred from an animal that has been exposed to the pathogen to a naive (unexposed) animal. When the serum recipient is subsequently exposed to a lethal dose
of the bacteria, the animal survives. This effect is specific for the pathogen used to elicit the response. Serum thus contains a transferable substance (antibody) that protects against the harmful effects of a virulent pathogen. Serum harvested from these animals, said to be immune, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Heating of immune serum destroys its bactericidal activity. Addition of fresh unheated serum from a naive animal restores the bactericidal activity of heated immune serum. Serum thus contains another substance that complements the activity of antibodies.

antibodies (see the classical pathway in Figure 23-5). Immunoglobulins can neutralize (render inactive) not only bacterial toxins but also harmful agents such as viruses by binding directly to them in a manner that prevents the virus from attaching itself to host cells. Generation of neutralizing antibodies is the rationale underlying virtually all vaccination strategies. Vaccination is a form of active immunization that consists of deliberately exposing an individual to a foreign antigen to elicit protective immunity by generating an adaptive immune response (described below) and antibodies. In the same vein, antibodies raised against snake venoms can be administered to the victims of snake bites to protect them from intoxication, provided the administration occurs relatively soon after the bite: the antibodies bind to the toxic proteins in the venom, keeping them from binding to their targets in the host, and in so doing neutralize them. This procedure, called passive immunization, can save lives by instant neutralization of a noxious substance such as a toxin. Passive immunization is also used prophylactically to protect those who travel to areas where a disease such as viral hepatitis is endemic: administration of serum from immune individuals provides temporary protection against infection. Antibodies can thus have immediate protective effects. Given that today's medical advances allow the survival of individuals whose immune systems are severely compromised (cancer patients receiving chemotherapy or radiation, transplant patients with a pharmacologically suppressed immune system, patients who suffer from AIDS, individuals with inborn deficiencies of the immune system), passive immunization can be of immediate practical importance. The deliberate exposure of an animal such as a mouse or rabbit to a foreign substance (immunization) allows the production of antisera that specifically recognize that substance (the antigen). These antisera have become standard components of the cell biologist's toolbox.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.1

## Overview of Host Defenses

- Mechanical and chemical defenses provide protection against most pathogens. This protection is immediate and continuous, yet possesses little specificity. Innate and adaptive immunity provide defenses against pathogens that breach the body's mechanical or chemical boundaries (see Figure 23-1).
- The circulatory and lymphatic systems distribute the molecular and cellular players in innate and adaptive immunity throughout the body (see Figure 23-2).
- Innate immunity is mediated by the complement system (see Figure 23-5) and several types of leukocytes, the most important of which are neutrophils and other phagocytic cells such as macrophages and dendritic cells. The cells and molecules of the innate immune system are deployed rapidly (minutes to hours). Molecular patterns diagnostic of the
presence of pathogens can be recognized by Toll-like and other receptors, but the specificity of recognition is modest, as these receptors are capable of recognizing rather broad sets of related molecules.
- Adaptive immunity is mediated by T and B lymphocytes. These cells require days for full activation and deployment, but they can distinguish between closely related antigens. This specificity of antigen recognition is the key distinguishing feature of adaptive immunity.
- Innate and adaptive immunity act in a mutually synergistic fashion. Inflammation, an early response to tissue injury or infection, involves a series of events that combines elements of innate and adaptive immunity (see Figure 23-7).


### 23.2 Immunoglobulins: Structure and Function

Immunoglobulins (also called antibodies), produced by B cells, are the best-understood of the molecules that confer adaptive immunity. An individual human has the capacity to make a limitless number of different antibodies, but any given specific antibody is typically made only when the individual has been exposed to the antigen (immunized) to which the antibody will bind specifically-hence antibody production is an adaptive immune response. In this section, we describe the structural organization of immunoglobulins, their diversity, and how they bind to antigens. The mechanisms that generate diverse antibodies are described in Section 23.3.

## Immunoglobulins Have a Conserved Structure Consisting of Heavy and Light Chains

Immunoglobulins are abundant serum proteins that fall into several classes with distinct structural and functional properties. Immunoglobulins were identified as the class of serum proteins responsible for antibody activity when they were biochemically purified from serum isolated from immunized animals (called antiserum). They were purified based on their abilities to mediate the killing of microbes and to bind directly to their corresponding, or cognate, antigens. Immunoglobulins of the most common class are composed of two identical heavy (H) chains, covalently attached to two identical light (L) chains (Figure 23-9; other classes are described below). The typical immunoglobulin (sometimes abbreviated Ig ) therefore has a twofold-symmetric structure, described as $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$. One $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ antibody molecule can usually bind to two antigen molecules (bivalent binding; see below). An exception to this basic $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ architecture occurs in the immunoglobulins made by camelids (camels, llamas, vicunas). These animals can make some immunoglobulins that are heavy-chain dimers $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}\right)$ and lack light chains.

A biochemical approach was used to answer the question of how antibodies manage to distinguish among related molecules-that is, how one antibody can bind to its specific

antigen but not to another, structurally very similar, molecule. Proteolytic enzymes were used to fragment immunoglobulins, which are rather large proteins ( $\sim 150 \mathrm{kDa}$ ), to identify the regions in the protein that are directly involved in antigen binding (see Figure 23-9). The protease papain yields fragments, called $F(a b)$ for antigen binding fragment, that can bind a single antigen molecule (monovalent fragments), whereas the protease pepsin yields bivalent fragments, referred to as $F\left(a b^{\prime}\right)_{2}\left(\mathrm{~F}=\right.$ fragment; $\mathrm{ab}=$ antibody) that exhibit bivalent binding. These enzymes are commonly used to convert intact immunoglobulin molecules into monovalent or bivalent reagents. Although $\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{ab})$ fragments are incapable of cross-linking antigen, $\mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{ab}^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragments can do so. Researchers frequently take advantage of this property to cross-link and thus activate surface receptors. Many receptors, such as the EGF receptor, dimerize upon engagement of ligand (ligand-induced dimerization), a prerequisite for full activation of downstream signaling cascades. Many receptors on immune-system cells behave in similar fashion.
![li18035345559](li18035345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-9 The basic structure of an immunoglobulin molecule. Antibodies are serum proteins also known as immunoglobulins. They are twofold-symmetric structures composed of two identical heavy chains and two identical light chains. Fragmentation of antibodies with proteases yields fragments that retain antigen-binding capacity. The protease papain yields monovalent $F(a b)$ fragments, and the protease pepsin yields bivalent $\mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{ab}^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragments. The Fc fragment is unable to bind antigen, but this portion of the intact molecule has other functional properties.

The portion released upon papain digestion and incapable of antigen binding is called Fc because of its ease of crystallization ( $\mathrm{F}=$ fragment; $\mathrm{c}=$ crystallizable).

## Multiple Immunoglobulin Isotypes Exist, Each with Different Functions

Immunoglobulins can be divided into different classes, or isotypes, based on their distinct biochemical properties. There are two light-chain isotypes, $\kappa$ and $\lambda$. The heavy chains show more variation: in mammals, the major heavychain isotypes are $\mu, \delta, \gamma, \alpha$, and $\varepsilon$. These heavy chains can associate with either $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ light chains. Depending on the vertebrate species, further subdivisions occur within the $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ isotypes, and fish possess an isotype that is not found in mammals. The fully assembled immunoglobulin (Ig) derives its name from the heavy chain: $\mu$ chains yield IgM; $\alpha$ chains, IgA; $\gamma$ chains, IgG; $\delta$ chains, IgD; and $\varepsilon$ chains, IgE. The general structures of the major Ig isotypes are depicted in Figure 23-10. By means of the unique structural features of the Fc portions of their heavy chains, each of the different Ig isotypes carries out specialized functions.

The IgM molecule is secreted as a pentamer of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ chains, stabilized by disulfide bonds between the ends of the heavy chains and an additional chain, the J chain. In its pentameric form, IgM possesses ten identical antigen-binding sites (two for each $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ ), which allow high-avidity interactions with surfaces that display the cognate antigen. Avidity is defined as the product of the strength of interactions (affinity) of the available individual binding sites and the number of such binding sites. Many low-affinity interactions can lead to a high-avidity interaction (as in Velcro). Upon its deposition on a surface that carries the cognate antigen, the pentameric IgM molecule assumes a conformation that is highly conducive to activation of the complement cascade, and is thus an effective means of damaging the membrane onto which it is adsorbed and onto which complement proteins are deposited as a consequence.

The IgA molecule also interacts with the J chain, forming a dimer of $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ molecules. Dimeric IgA can bind to the polymeric IgA receptor found on the basolateral side of epithelial cells, where its binding triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis. Subsequently, the IgA receptor is cleaved, and the dimeric IgA, with a fragment of the receptor (the secretory piece) still attached, is released from the apical side of the epithelial cell. This process, called transcytosis, is an effective means of delivering immunoglobulins from the basolateral side of an epithelium to the apical side (Figure 23-11a). Tears and other secretions, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, are rich in IgA—grams of immunoglobulin are secreted each day!-and so provide protection against environmental pathogens.

The IgG isotype is important for neutralization of virus particles. This isotype also helps prepare particulate antigens, such as viruses or larger fragments of bacteria, for acquisition by cells equipped with receptors specific for the Fc portion of the IgG molecule (see below).

![li18135345559](li18135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-10 Immunoglobulin isotypes. The different classes of immunoglobulins, called isotypes, may be distinguished biochemically and by immunological techniques. In mice and humans, there are two light-chain isotypes ( $\kappa$ and $\lambda$ ) and five heavy-chain isotypes ( $\mu, \delta$, $\gamma, \varepsilon, \alpha$ ). Each isotype defines a class of immunoglobulin based on the identity of the heavy chain. $\lg G, \lg E$, and $\lg D$ (not shown) are monomers
with generally similar overall structures. $\lg M$ and $\lg A$ can occur in serum as pentamers and dimers, respectively, accompanied by an accessory subunit, the J chain, in covalent disulfide linkage. This volume-rendered depiction of the immunoglobulins highlights their modular design, with each barrel representing an individual Ig domain. Different isotypes have different functions. See Figure 23-13 for definitions of abbreviations.

The immune system of the newborn mammal is immature, but protective antibodies are transferred from the mother to the newborn via the mother's milk. The receptor responsible for capturing maternal $\operatorname{IgG}$ is the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), which is present on intestinal epithelial cells in rodents. By transcytosis, maternal IgG captured on the luminal side of the newborn's intestinal tract is delivered across the gut epithelium and made available for passive protection of the infant rodent (Figure 23-11b). In humans, FcRn is found on fetal cells that contact the maternal circulation in the placenta. Transcytosis of IgG antibodies from the maternal circulation across the placenta delivers maternal antibodies to the fetus. These maternal antibodies will protect the newborn until its immune system is sufficiently mature to produce antibodies on its own. In adults, FcRn is also expressed on endothelial cells and helps control the turnover of IgG in the circulation as well as the delivery of IgG across the endothelial barrier and into underlying tissue.

As we will see in Section 23.3, the IgM and IgD isotypes are expressed as membrane-bound receptors on newly generated B cells. Here the $\mu$ chains have an important role in B-cell development and activation.

## Each Naive B Cell Produces a Unique Immunoglobulin

The clonal selection theory stipulates that each naive lymphocyte (not yet having seen its specific antigen) carries an antigen-binding receptor of unique specificity. When a lymphocyte encounters the antigen for which it is specific, clonal expansion (rapid cell division to form a group of cells-a clone-all of which originated from a single precursor cell) occurs and so allows an amplification of the response, culminating in secretion of large amounts of specific antibody (the same one made by the original precursor cell) (Figure 23-12). The antigen-specific antibody is responsible for binding to the antigen and subsequently mediating the clearing of the antigen out of the body. In a typical immune response, the antigen that elicits the response is of complex composition: even the simplest virus contains several distinct proteins, and each protein may present to the immune system several molecularly distinct features that can be recognized independently of one another. Thus many individual lymphocytes respond to a given antigen and expand into independent clones in response to it, each producing its own antigen-specific receptor and antibody of unique structure and therefore with unique binding characteristics (affinity). Because each lymphocyte is endowed with a unique receptor and clonally expands in response to antigen, this response of multiple, independent precursors is characterized as polyclonal.

B-cell tumors, which represent malignant clonal expansions of individual lymphocytes, enabled the first molecular analysis of the processes that underlie the generation of antibody diversity. A key observation was that tumors derived from lymphocytes may produce large quantities of secreted immunoglobulins. Some of the light chains of these immunoglobulins are secreted in the urine of patients

FIGURE 23-11 Transcytosis of IgA and IgG. (a) IgA, found in tears and in the secretions of various mucous membranes, must be transported across the epithelium. IgA binds to the polymeric IgA receptor and is endocytosed. As the resulting complex is transported across the epithelial monolayer, a portion of the receptor is cleaved, and the IgA, still bound to a portion of the receptor, the secretory piece, is released at the apical side. (b) Suckling rodents acquire Ig from their mother's milk. At the apical surface of its intestinal epithelium, the newborn possesses the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn), whose structure resembles that of class I MHC molecules (see Figure 23-23). After this receptor binds to the Fc portion of IgG, transcytosis moves the acquired IgG to the basolateral side of the epithelium. In humans, the syncytial trophoblast in the placenta expresses FcRn and so mediates acquisition of IgG from the maternal circulation and its delivery to the fetus (transplacental transport).

Activation of B cell
![li18435345559](li18435345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-12 Clonal selection. The clonal selection theory proposes the existence of a large set of lymphocytes, each equipped with its own unique antigen-specific receptor (indicated by different colors). The antigen that fits with the receptor carried by a particular lymphocyte binds to it and stimulates that lymphocyte to expand clonally. From a modest number of antigen-specific cells, a large number of cells of the desired specificity (and large amounts of their secreted products) may be generated.
with such tumors. These light chains, called Bence-Jones proteins after their discoverers, can be readily purified and afforded the first target for a protein chemical analysis of immunoglobulins.

Two key observations emerged from this work. First, no two independent tumors produced light chains with identical biochemical properties, suggesting that they were all unique in sequence. Second, the differences in amino acid sequence that distinguished one light chain from another were not randomly distributed, but were clustered in a domain referred to as the variable region of the light chain, or $V_{L}$. This domain comprises the N-terminal $\sim 110$ amino acids of the light chain. The remainder of the sequence is identical for the different light chains (provided they derive from the same isotype, either $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ ) and is therefore referred to as the constant region, or $C_{L}$. Immunoglobulins unique to each individual patient were subsequently purified from the patients' serum. Sequencing of the heavy chains from these preparations revealed that the variable residues that distinguished one heavy chain from another were again concentrated in a well-demarcated domain, referred to as the variable region of the heavy chain, or $V_{H}$.

An alignment of variable-region sequences obtained from different light chains showed a nonrandom pattern of regions of variability, revealing three hypervariable regions-HV1, HV2, and HV3-which are sandwiched between what are called framework regions (Figure 23-13a).

![li18535345559](li18535345559.jpg)
(Similar alignments for the immunoglobulin heavy-chain sequences also yielded hypervariable regions.) In the properly folded three-dimensional structure of immunoglobulins, these hypervariable regions are in close proximity (Figures 23-13b and 23-14) and make contact with antigen. Thus that portion of an Ig molecule containing the hypervariable regions constitutes the antigen-binding site. For this reason, hypervariable regions are also referred to as complementarity-determining regions (CDRs).

The difficulty of encoding directly in the inherited genome (germ line) all the information necessary to generate the enormously diverse antibody repertoire (more than a million different antibody molecules in what we now know is a genome encoding about 20,000 independent genes) led to suggestions of unique genetic mechanisms to account for this diversity. Given the size of a typical antibody heavy chain and light chain (each heavy chain-light chain combination, if encoded as such, would require $2.5-3.5 \mathrm{~kb}$ of DNA, depending on the isotype), it is immediately obvious that encoding a set of antibody molecules of sufficient diversity to provide adequate protection against the wide array of pathogens and other foreign substances to which an organism is exposed would rapidly exhaust its DNA coding capacity. We shall see that, indeed, unique mechanisms are at work to create an adequately diverse set of antibodies.

FIGURE 23-13 Hypervariable regions and the immunoglobulin fold. (a) Amino acid variability varies with residue position in Ig light chains. Here the percentage of variable-region sequences with variant amino acids is plotted for each position in the sequence. Positions for which many different amino acid side chains are present are assigned a high variability index; those that are invariant among the sequences compared are assigned a value of 0 . This analysis reveals three regions of increased variability: hypervariability (HV) regions 1, 2, and 3; these regions are also called complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). (b) Volume-rendered depiction of $\mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{ab}^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragment (right) and ribbon diagram of a typical Ig light-chain variable region $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$ with the positions of the hypervariable regions indicated in red (left). The hypervariable regions are found in the loops that connect the $\beta$ strands and make contact with antigen. The $\beta$ strands (rendered as arrows) make up two $\beta$ sheets and constitute the framework region. Each variable and constant domain has this characteristic three-dimensional structure, called the immunoglobulin fold. $\mathrm{L}=$ light chain; $\mathrm{H}=$ heavy chain; $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}=$ heavy-chain variable region; $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}=$ light-chain variable region; $C_{\mathrm{H}} 1, C_{\mathrm{H}} 2, C_{\mathrm{H}} 3=$ heavy-chain constant domains; $C_{\mathrm{L}}=$ light-chain constant region.

## Immunoglobulin Domains Have a Characteristic Fold Composed of Two $\beta$ Sheets Stabilized by a Disulfide Bond

Both the variable and constant domains of immunoglobulins fold into a compact three-dimensional structure composed exclusively of $\beta$ sheets (see Figure 23-13b). A typical Ig domain contains two $\beta$ sheets (one with three strands and one with four strands) held together like a sandwich by a disulfide bond. The residues that point inward are mostly hydrophobic and help stabilize this sandwich structure. The residues exposed to the aqueous environment show a greater frequency of polar and charged side chains. The spacing of the cysteine residues that make up the disulfide bond and a small number of strongly conserved residues characterize this evolutionarily ancient structural motif, termed the immunoglobulin fold. The basic immunoglobulin fold is also found in numerous eukaryotic proteins that are not directly involved in antigen-specific recognition, including the Ig superfamily of cell-adhesion molecules, or IgCAMs (see Chapter 20).

The region on an antigen that makes contact with the corresponding antibody is called an epitope. A protein antigen usually contains multiple epitopes, which are often exposed loops or surfaces on the protein and are thus accessible to antibody molecules. Each homogeneous antibody preparation derived from a clonal population of B cells recognizes a single molecularly defined epitope on the corresponding antigen.

In order to solve the structure of an antibody complexed to its cognate epitope on an antigen, it is important to have a source of homogeneous immunoglobulin and of antigen in pure form (see Chapter 3). As we have seen, homogeneous immunoglobulins can be obtained from B-cell tumors, but in that case, the antigen for which the antibody is specific is usually not known. The breakthrough essential for generating homogeneous antibody preparations suitable for structural

analysis was the development of techniques to obtain antibodies from hybridomas by use of a special selection medium (see Chapter 4, pages 135-136). The creation of immortalized cell lines that produce antibodies of defined specificity, called monoclonal antibodies, has yielded essential tools for the cell biologist: monoclonal antibodies are widely used not only for the specific detection of macromolecules, but also for detection and quantitation of drugs, drug metabolites, and even signaling molecules such as cAMP. Monoclonal antibodies can detect proteins and their modifications (phosphorylation, nitrosylation, methylation, acetylation, etc.) as well as complex carbohydrates, (glyco)lipids, and nucleic acids and their modifications, and they have therefore found widespread use in the laboratory as well as for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.

We now have detailed insights into the structure of a large number of monoclonal antibodies, each in a complex with the antigen for which it is specific. There are no hard-and-fast rules that describe these interactions, other than the usual rules of molecular complementarity of proteins with other (macro)molecules (see Chapter 3). The CDRs make the most important contributions to the antigen-antibody interface. The CDR3 of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}$ region of the Ig heavy chain plays a particularly prominent role, as does the CDR3 of the $\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}$ region of the Ig light chain.

## An Immunoglobulin's Constant Region Determines Its Functional Properties

As we have seen, antibodies recognize antigen via their variable regions. Their constant regions determine which effector molecules they recruit to neutralize the pathogen.

Antibodies attached to a viral or microbial surface can be recognized directly by cells that express receptors specific for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins. These Fc receptors (FcRs), which are specific for individual classes and subclasses of immunoglobulins, display considerable structural and functional heterogeneity. By means of FcR-dependent events, specialized phagocytic cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages can engage antibody-decorated particles, then ingest and destroy them. The noncovalent decoration of an antigenic target with antibodies, or its covalent modification with complement components, is called opsonization. FcR-dependent events also allow some immune-system cells (e.g., monocytes and natural killer cells) to directly engage target cells that display viral or other antigens to which antibodies are attached. This engagement may induce the immune-system cells to release toxic small molecules (e.g., reactive oxygen species) or the contents of cytotoxic granules, including perforins and granzymes. Perforins are proteins that can attach themselves to the surface of the engaged target cell and form pores in its membrane. These newly formed pores allow access by granzymes, proteases that initiate a sequence of events that will ultimately kill the target cell (see Figure 23-6). This process, called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), illustrates how cells of the innate immune system interact with, and benefit from, the products of the adaptive immune response.

Antigen-antibody (immune) complexes of some immunoglobulin isotypes can initiate the classical pathway of complement activation (see Figure 23-5). IgM and IgG3 are particularly good at complement activation, but all IgG classes can, in principle, activate complement, whereas IgA

and IgE are unable to do so. The large amounts of IgA found in the gut contribute to its barrier function by neutralizing gut-resident microbes.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.2

## Immunoglobulins: Structure and Function

- Most immunoglobulins (antibodies) are composed of two identical heavy $(\mathrm{H})$ chains and two identical light (L) chains $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}\right)$. Each chain contains a variable (V) region and a constant (C) region. Proteolytic fragmentation yields monovalent $\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{ab})$ and bivalent $\mathrm{F}\left(\mathrm{ab}^{\prime}\right)_{2}$ fragments, which contain variable-region domains that retain antigen-binding capability (see Figure 23-9). The Fc fragment contains constant-region domains and determines their ability to activate complement components or bind to receptors specific for Fc regions expressed on leukocytes.
- Immunoglobulins are divided into classes based on the constant regions of their heavy chains (see Figure 23-10). In mammals, there are five major classes: $\operatorname{IgM}, \operatorname{IgD}, \operatorname{IgG}, \operatorname{IgA}$, and IgE; the corresponding heavy chains are referred to as $\mu$, $\delta, \gamma, \alpha$, and $\varepsilon$. There are two major classes of light chains, $\kappa$ and $\lambda$, again characterized by the attributes of their constant regions.
- IgM and IgA can form higher-order structures: IgM can form pentamers (five identical $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ copies), and $\operatorname{IgA}$ can form dimers (two identical $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{~L}_{2}$ copies)
- Each individual B lymphocyte expresses an immunoglobulin of unique sequence and is therefore uniquely specific for a particular antigen. Upon recognition of antigen, only a B lymphocyte that bears a receptor specific for it will be activated and expand clonally (clonal selection) (see Figure 23-12).
- The antigen specificity of antibodies is conferred by their variable regions, which contain regions of high sequence variability, called hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions (see Figure 23-13a). These hypervariable regions are positioned at the tip of the variable region, where they can make specific contacts with the antigen for which a particular antibody is specific.
- The repeating immunoglobulin domains that make up immunoglobulin molecules have a characteristic three-dimensional structure, the immunoglobulin fold, which consists of two $\beta$ sheets held together in a sandwich by a disulfide bond (see Figure 23-13b).
- The constant regions of the heavy chains endow antibodies with unique effector functions, such as the capacity to bind complement, the ability to be transported across epithelia, or the ability to interact with receptors specific for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins.


### 23.3 Generation of Antibody Diversity and B-Cell Development

Pathogens have short replication times, are quite diverse in their genetic makeup, and evolve quickly, generating enormous antigenic variation. An adequate defense must therefore be capable of mounting an equally diverse response. Antibodies provide the diversity required for successful host defense. The timing of the antibody response and its necessary adjustment to changes in the antigenic makeup of the pathogen pose unique demands on the organization and regulation of the adaptive immune system. A unique mechanism has evolved that allows not only virtually limitless variation in the set of antibodies that can be produced (called the repertoire), but also rapid improvement in the quality of those antibodies, to meet the demands posed by an ongoing viral or bacterial infection. Because optimal antibody production by B cells requires assistance from T cells, we will see below that the molecular mechanisms underlying lymphocyte diversity are fundamentally similar for B and T cells.

B cells, which are responsible for antibody production, make use of a unique mechanism by which the genetic information required for synthesis of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains is stitched together from separate DNA sequences, or Ig gene segments, to create a functional transcription unit. The recombination mechanism that combines Ig gene segments itself dramatically expands the variability in sequence precisely where these genetic elements are joined together. This mechanism for generating a diverse array of antibodies is fundamentally different from meiotic recombination, which occurs only in germ cells, and from alternative splicing of exons (see Chapter 8). Because this recombination mechanism occurs in somatic cells but not in germ cells, it is known as somatic gene rearrangement or somatic recombination. This unusual recombination mechanism, unique to antigen-specific receptors on B and T lymphocytes, makes it possible to specify an enormously diverse set of receptors with minimal expenditure of DNA coding space. The discovery of somatic recombination is detailed in Classic Experiment 23-1.

The ability to combine discrete genetic elements at will (combinatorial diversity), in addition to the generation of yet more sequence diversity in the encoded receptors by the underlying recombination mechanisms themselves, allows adaptive immune responses against a virtually limitless array of antigens, including molecules encoded by the host. Thus there are mechanisms at work not only to create this enormous diversity, but also to impose tolerance to curtail unwanted reactivity against "self" components; the result of such reactivity is autoimmunity. Neither mechanism is perfect: the adaptive immune system cannot generate receptors for all foreign substances. Furthermore, the unavoidable price we pay for how we generate B- and T-cell receptors is the likelihood of self-reactive receptors (autoimmunity).

## A Functional Light-Chain Gene Requires Assembly of V and J Gene Segments

Genes encoding intact immunoglobulins do not exist already assembled in the genome, ready for expression. Instead, the required gene segments are brought together and assembled in the course of B-cell development. The organization of the region of the genome containing the immunoglobulin genes is shown in Figure 23-15. In B cells, the DNA in this region is rearranged as described below to generate assembled and fully functional immunoglobulin-encoding genes in each B cell and its descendants. Although the rearrangement of heavy-chain genes occurs before the rearrangement of lightchain genes, we discuss light-chain genes first because of their less complex organization.

The immunoglobulin light-chain genes consist of clusters of V gene segments, followed downstream by a single C segment. Each V gene segment carries its own promoter sequence and encodes the bulk of the light-chain variable region, although a small piece of the nucleotide sequence encoding the light-chain variable region is missing from the V gene segment. This missing portion is provided by one of the multiple J segments located between the V segments and the single C segment in the unrearranged $\kappa$ light-chain locus (see Figure 23-15a). (This J segment is a genetic element, not to be confused with the J chain, a polypeptide subunit of the pentameric IgM molecule and found also in association with IgA; see Figure 23-10.) In the course of B-cell development, commitment of a B-cell precursor to use a particular V gene segment-a random process-results in its physical juxtaposition with one of the J segments, again a random choice, to form an exon encoding the entire light-chain variable region $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{L}}\right)$. This DNA rearrangement not only generates an intact and functional light-chain gene, but also places the promoter sequence of the rearranged gene within controlling distance of enhancer elements, located downstream of the light-chain constant-region exon, that are required for its transcription. Only a fully rearranged light-chain gene is transcribed and subsequently translated into protein.

FIGURE 23-15 Overview of somatic gene
rearrangement in immunoglobulin DNA. The stem cells that give rise to $B$ cells contain multiple gene segments encoding portions of immunoglobulin heavy and light chains. During development of a B cell, somatic recombination of these gene segments yields functional light-chain genes (a) and heavy-chain genes (b). Each V gene segment carries its own promoter. Rearrangement brings an enhancer close enough to the combined sequence to activate transcription. The light-chain variable region $\left(V_{L}\right)$ is encoded by two joined gene segments, and the heavy-chain variable region $\left(V_{H}\right)$ is encoded by three joined segments. Note that the chromosomal regions encoding immunoglobulins contain many more V, D, and J segments than shown. In addition, the $\kappa$ light-chain locus contains a single constant (C) segment, as shown, but the heavy-chain locus contains several distinct $C$ segments (not shown) corresponding to the immunoglobulin isotypes.

FIGURE 23-16 (Opposite page) Mechanism of rearrangement of immunoglobulin gene segments via deletional joining.
(a) Location of the DNA elements involved in somatic recombination of immunoglobulin gene segments at the light-chain locus (top) and at the heavy-chain locus (bottom). D segments are present in the heavy-chain, but not the light-chain, locus. At the $3^{\prime}$ end of all V gene segments is a conserved recombination signal sequence (RSS) composed of a heptamer, a 12-bp spacer, and a nonamer. Each of the J or D segments with which a V can recombine possesses at its $5^{\prime}$ end a similar RSS with a 23-bp spacer. The nonamer and heptamer sequences at the $5^{\prime}$ end of J or D are complementary and antiparallel to those found at the $3^{\prime}$ end of each V when read on the same (top) strand. The RSSs that flank the D segments have spacers of identical length, preventing the formation of D to D rearrangements. (b) Hypothetical model of how two coding regions to be joined may be arranged spatially, stabilized by the RAG1 and RAG2 recombinase complex. Both strands of the DNA are shown. (c) Events in the joining of V to J (light chain) or to DJ (heavy chain) coding regions. The germline DNA (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ) is folded, bringing the segments to be joined close together, and the RAG1/RAG2 complex makes single-stranded cuts at the boundaries between the coding sequences and RSSs (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The free $3^{\prime}-\mathrm{OH}$ groups attack the complementary strands, creating a covalently closed hairpin at each coding end and a clean doublestranded break at each boundary with an RSS (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The hairpins are opened, either symmetrically (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ), as shown for the J (light chain) or DJ (heavy chain) segment, or asymmetrically (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ), as shown for the V segment. For D to J and V to DJ rearrangements in the heavy-chain locus, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase adds nucleotides in a template-independent manner to opened hairpins (step $\mathbf{\square}$, right), generating an overhang (yellow) of unpaired nucleotides of random sequence ( N -region); asymmetric opening automatically creates a palindromic overhang (step $\mathbf{\square}$, left). The unpaired overhangs at the ends of both the V and J (light chain) or DJ (heavy chain) coding regions are filled in by DNA polymerase (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ) or may be excised by an exonuclease. DNA ligase IV joins the two segments generated from the V and J coding regions (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). N -region addition does not take place for V to J (light chain) rearrangements. See text for additional discussion.

Recombination Signal Sequences Detailed DNA sequence analysis of the light-chain and heavy-chain regions revealed a conserved sequence element at the $3^{\prime}$ end of each V gene segment. This conserved element, called a recombination signal sequence (RSS), is composed of heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by a 23-bp spacer. At the $5^{\prime}$ end of each J segment, there is a similarly conserved RSS that contains a 12-bp spacer (Figure 23-16a). The 12- and 23-bp spacers separate the conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences by one and two turns of the DNA helix, respectively.

Somatic recombination is catalyzed by two enzymes, the RAG1 and RAG2 recombinases, which are expressed only in lymphocytes (Figure 23-17). Thus these rearrangements do not occur in any other cells of the body. Juxtaposition of the two gene segments to be joined is stabilized by the RAG1/ RAG2 complex (Figure 23-16b). The recombinases then make a single-stranded cut at the exact boundary of each coding sequence and its adjacent RSS. Only gene segments that possess heptamer-nonamer RSSs with spacers of different lengths can engage in this type of rearrangement (the so-called 12/23-bp spacer rule). Each newly created -OH group at the site of cleavage then executes a nucleophilic attack on the complementary strand, creating a covalently closed hairpin for each of the two coding ends and doublestrand breaks at the ends of the RSSs. Protein complexes that include the Ku70 and Ku80 proteins hold this complex together so that the ends about to be joined remain in close proximity: double-strand breaks in chromosomes need to be repaired, and thus the ends need to be held together for resolution and repair of these breaks to proceed. The RSS ends

FIGURE 23-17 RAG1/RAG2 structure. (a) RAG1/RAG2 is shown in complex with the recombination signal sequences, positioning the 12 - and 23 -bp spacer sequences to enable cleavage at the boundary of the coding sequence and the heptamer of the RSS. (b) DNA can be cleaved by hairpin-forming bacterial and eukaryotic transposases, the evolutionary precursors of the RAG1/RAG2 complex. Shown here
are then covalently joined without loss or addition of nucleotides, creating a circular reaction product (deletion circle) containing the intervening DNA, which is lost altogether. The hairpin ends of the coding segments undergoing recombination are then opened and finally joined as depicted in Figure 23-16c, completing the recombination process.

The recombination mechanism just described, called deletional joining, occurs when the V gene segment involved has the same transcriptional orientation as the other gene segments at the light-chain locus. Some V gene segments, however, have the opposite transcriptional orientation. These segments are joined to J segments by a mechanism, termed inversional joining, in which the V segment is inverted and the intervening DNA and RSSs are not lost from the locus.

Defects in the synthesis of RAG proteins obliterate the possibility of somatic gene rearrangements. As described below, the rearrangement process is essential for B-cell development; consequently, RAG deficiency leads to the complete absence of B cells. People with defects in RAG gene function suffer from severe immunodeficiency. Targeted deletion of RAG genes in mice likewise leads to a complete defect in immunoglobulin (and T-cell receptor) gene rearrangement, resulting in a developmental block in the generation of B and T lymphocytes.

Junctional Imprecision In addition to the random selection of V and J gene segments, processing of the intermediates created in the course of somatic recombination provides an additional means for expanding the variability of immunoglobulin sequences. This additional variability is created at the junction of the segments to be joined. The opening of
![li19135345559](li19135345559.jpg)
is the generation of a single-strand break, followed by an attack by the newly generated $3^{\prime}$ hydroxyl on the complementary strand to form a hairpin and a double-strand break. [Data from M. S. Kim et al., 2015, Nature 518:507-511, PDB ID 4www; A. B. Hickman et al., 2014, Cell 158:353-367, PDB ID 4d1q; and F. F. Yin et al., 2009, Nat. Struct. Biol. 16:499-508, PDB ID 3gna.]

the hairpins at the coding ends is a key step in this process: this opening may occur symmetrically or asymmetrically (see Figure 23-16c, steps $\mathbf{\square}$ and $\mathbf{\square}$ ). The protein Artemis, whose function requires the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, carries out the opening of the hairpins.

If the opening of a hairpin is asymmetric, a short, singlestranded palindromic sequence is generated. Filling in of this overhang by DNA polymerase results in the addition of several nucleotides, called $P$-nucleotides, that were not part of the original coding region of the gene segment in question. Alternatively, the overhang may be removed by an exonuclease, resulting in the removal of nucleotides from the original coding region. These possibilities apply equally to the V and the J coding regions. Symmetric opening of a hairpin retains all the original coding information. However, even if the hairpin is opened symmetrically, the ends of the DNA molecule tend to breathe, creating short single-stranded sequences, which may also be attacked by nucleases. Once the hairpins have been opened and the coding ends processed, the ends are ligated by two proteins, DNA ligase IV and XRCC4, generating a functional light-chain gene.

Inherent in this rearrangement process is junctional imprecision resulting in part from the addition and loss of nucleotides at the coding-region joints. When a V and a J segment recombine, the sequence and reading frame of the VJ product cannot be predicted. Only one in three recombination reactions results in a reading frame that is compatible with light-chain synthesis. The others produce frameshifts that do not encode functional proteins.

Light-chain diversity therefore arises not only from the combinatorial use of V and J gene segments, but also from junctional imprecision. Inspection of the three-dimensional structure of the light chain shows that the highly diverse joint generated as a consequence of junctional imprecision forms part of a loop-hypervariable region 3 (HV3)—that projects into the antigen-binding site and makes contact with antigen (see Figure 23-13b).

## Rearrangement of the Heavy-Chain Locus Involves V, D, and J Gene Segments

The organization of the heavy-chain locus is more complex than that of the $\kappa$ light-chain locus. The heavy-chain locus contains not only a large tandem array of V segments (each equipped with its own promoter) and multiple J segments, but also multiple D (diversity) segments (see Figure 23-15b). Somatic recombination of a V, a D, and a J segment generates a rearranged sequence encoding the heavy-chain variable region $\left(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{H}}\right)$.

At the $3^{\prime}$ end of each V segment in heavy-chain DNA, there are conserved heptamer and nonamer sequences separated by spacer DNA, similar to the recombination signal sequences (RSSs) in light-chain DNA. These RSSs are also found in complementary and antiparallel configuration at the $5^{\prime}$ end and the $3^{\prime}$ end of each D segment (see Figure 23-16a). The J segments are similarly equipped at their $5^{\prime}$ end with the requisite RSS. The spacer lengths in these RSSs are such
that D segments can join to J segments, and V segments to already rearranged DJ segments. However, neither direct V-to-J nor D-to-D joining is allowed, in compliance with the 12/23-bp spacer rule. Heavy-chain rearrangements proceed via the same mechanisms described above for light-chain rearrangements.

In the course of B-cell development, the heavy-chain locus is always rearranged first, starting with D-J rearrangement. D-J rearrangement is followed by V-D-J rearrangement. In the course of the D-J and V-D-J rearrangements, an enzyme called terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) may add nucleotides to free $3^{\prime} \mathrm{OH}$ ends of DNA in a template-independent fashion. Up to a dozen or so nucleotides, called the N -region or N-nucleotides, may be added, generating additional sequence diversity at the junctions whenever D-J and V-D-J rearrangements occur (see Figure 23-16c, step ). Only one in three rearrangements yields the proper reading frame for the rearranged VDJ sequence. If the rearrangement yields a sequence encoding a functional protein, it is called productive. Although the heavy-chain locus is present on each of two homologous chromosomes, only one productive rearrangement is permitted, as we will see below.

An enhancer located downstream of the cluster of J segments and upstream of the constant-region segment activates transcription from the promoter at the $5^{\prime}$ end of the rearranged VDJ sequence (see Figure 23-15). Splicing of the primary transcript produced from the rearranged heavychain gene generates a functional mRNA encoding the $\mu$ heavy chain. For both heavy-chain and light-chain genes, somatic recombination places the promoters upstream of the V segments within functional reach of the enhancers necessary to allow transcription, so that only rearranged VJ and VDJ sequences, and not the V segments that remain in the germ-line configuration, are transcribed.

## Somatic Hypermutation Allows the Generation and Selection of Antibodies with Improved Affinities

In addition to somatic recombination and junctional imprecision, antigen-activated B cells can undergo an additional diversity-generating process called somatic hypermutation. Upon exposure to antigen and receipt of the proper additional signals, most of which are provided by T cells, expression of activation-induced deaminase (AID) is turned on. This enzyme deaminates cytosine residues, converting them to uracil. When a B cell that carries this lesion replicates, it may place an adenine on the complementary strand, thus generating a G-to-A transition (see Figure 5-34). Alternatively, the uracil may be excised by DNA glycosylase to yield an abasic site. Such abasic sites, when copied, give rise to possible transitions as well as a transversion, unless the nucleotide opposite the gap is the original $G$ that paired with the cytosine target. Mutations thus accumulate with every successive round of B-cell division, yielding numerous mutations in the rearranged VJ and VDJ segments. Error-prone

filling by DNA polymerase of gaps created by nucleotide excision repair also contributes to somatic hypermutation.

The process of somatic hypermutation occurs when lymphocytes reside in specialized microanatomic structures known as germinal centers. These structures, which arise within the follicles of secondary lymphoid organs upon immunization, consist of foci of thousands of rapidly proliferating and hypermutating B cells. In addition to B cells, germinal centers contain follicular dendritic cells, a cell type that serves as a depot for antigen that can be retrieved by B cells, and a small number of helper T cells specialized in providing selective signals that control B cells. Many of the somatic mutations induced by AID are deleterious in that they reduce the affinity of the encoded antibody for an antigen, but some improve the encoded antibody's affinity for an antigen. In a process analogous to Darwinian evolution, B cells carrying affinity-increasing mutations have a selective advantage in picking up antigen from follicular dendritic cells, which allows them to successfully compete for signals from the limiting number of helper T cells residing in the germinal center, as described in Section 23.6. These signals thus trigger the clonal selection of higher-affinity B cells for further proliferation and additional mutations, as well as for differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells or memory B cells. The net result is generation of a B-cell population whose antibodies, as a rule, show a higher affinity for the antigen.

In the course of an immune response, or upon repeated immunization, the adaptive immune response exhibits affinity maturation-an increase in the average affinity of antibodies for an antigen as a function of time after antigen exposure-as the result of somatic hypermutation and selection. Antibodies produced following this phase of the adaptive immune response display affinities for antigen in the nanomolar (or better) range. For reasons that are not understood, the activity of AID is focused mainly on rearranged VJ and VDJ segments, and this targeting may therefore require active transcription. The entire process of somatic hypermutation is strictly antigen-dependent and shows an absolute requirement for interactions between the B cells and certain T-cell types.

## B-Cell Development Requires Input from a Pre-B-Cell Receptor

As we have seen, B cells destined to make immunoglobulins must rearrange the necessary gene segments to assemble functional heavy-chain and light-chain genes. These rearrangements occur in a carefully ordered sequence during the development of a B cell, starting with heavy-chain rearrangements. Moreover, the rearranged heavy chain is first used to build a membrane-bound receptor that executes a cell fate decision necessary to drive further B-cell development (and antibody synthesis) by permitting subsequent rearrangement of the light-chain genes. Only a productive rearrangement that yields an in-frame VDJ combination can generate a complete $\mu$ heavy chain. The production of that $\mu$ chain serves
as a signal to the B cell that it has successfully accomplished rearrangement, and that no further rearrangements of the heavy-chain locus on the remaining gene copy are required. Recall that each lymphocyte precursor starts out with two immunoglobulin locus-bearing, homologous chromosomes in the germ-line (unrearranged) configuration. In accordance with clonal selection theory, which stipulates that each lymphocyte ought to come equipped with a single antigen-specific receptor, continued rearrangement would entail the risk of producing B cells with two different heavy chains, each with different specificity-an undesirable outcome.

Successful rearrangement of V, D, and J segments in the heavy-chain locus thus allows the synthesis of a complete $\mu$ chain. B cells at this stage of development are called pre-B cells, as they have not yet completed assembly of a functional light-chain gene and therefore cannot engage in antigen recognition. The $\mu$ chain is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and becomes part of a membrane-bound signaling receptor whose expression is essential for B-cell development to proceed in orderly fashion.

In pre-B cells, newly made $\mu$ chains form a complex with two so-called surrogate light chains, $\lambda 5$ and VpreB (Figure 23-18). The $\mu$ chain itself possesses no cytoplasmic tail and is therefore incapable of recruiting cytoplasmic components for the purpose of signal transduction. Instead, pre-B cells express two auxiliary transmembrane proteins, called Ig $\alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$, each of which carries in its cytoplasmic tail an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif, or ITAM. The entire complex, including $\mu$ chain, $\lambda 5$, VpreB, $\operatorname{Ig} \alpha$, and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$, constitutes the pre-B-cell receptor (pre-BCR). Engagement of this receptor by (unknown) suitable signals results in recruitment and activation of an Src-family tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates tyrosine residues in the ITAMs. In their phosphorylated form, ITAMs recruit other molecules essential for signal transduction (see below). Because no functional light chains are yet part of this receptor, it is presumed to be incapable of antigen recognition, as the antigen-binding site has contributions from both the heavy and light chains (see Figure 23-14) (except in camelids).

The pre-B-cell receptor has several important functions. First, it shuts off expression of the RAG recombinases, so that rearrangement of the other (allelic) heavy-chain locus cannot proceed. This phenomenon, called allelic exclusion, ensures that only one of the two available copies of the heavy-chain locus will be rearranged and thus expressed as a complete $\mu$ chain. Second, because of the association of the pre-B-cell receptor with $\operatorname{Ig} \alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$, the receptor becomes a functional signal-transduction unit. Signals that emanate from the pre-BCR initiate proliferation of the pre-B-cell to expand the numbers of those B cells that have undergone productive D-J and V-D-J recombination.

In the course of this expansion, expression of the surrogate light chains, VpreB and $\lambda 5$, subsides. The progressive dilution of VpreB and $\lambda 5$ with every successive cell division results in insufficient fully assembled pre-BCR in the endoplasmic reticulum. As a consequence, the heavy chains

![li19235345559](li19235345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-18 Structure of the pre-B-cell receptor and its role in B-cell development. Successful rearrangement of V, D, and J heavy-chain gene segments allows synthesis of membrane-bound $\mu$ heavy chains in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of a pre-B cell. At this stage, no light-chain gene rearrangement has occurred. Newly made $\mu$ chains assemble with surrogate light chains, composed of $\lambda 5$ and VpreB, and $\operatorname{Ig} \alpha / \operatorname{Ig} \beta$ to yield the pre-B-cell receptor, pre-BCR (step 1). This receptor drives proliferation of those B cells that carry it. It also suppresses rearrangement of the
are degraded (see Chapters 13 and 14) and the amount of pre-BCR signaling decreases. This reduction in signaling allows re-initiation of expression of the RAG recombinases, which now target the $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ light-chain locus. A productive light-chain V-J rearrangement also shuts off rearrangement of the allelic locus (allelic exclusion). Upon completion of a successful V-J light-chain rearrangement, the B cell can make both $\mu$ heavy chains and $\kappa$ or $\lambda$ light chains and assemble them into a functional B-cell receptor (BCR), which can recognize antigen (see Figure 23-18).

Once a B cell expresses a complete BCR on its cell surface, it can recognize antigen, and all subsequent steps in B-cell activation and differentiation require engagement with the antigen for which that BCR is specific. The BCR not only plays a role in driving B-cell proliferation upon a successful encounter with antigen, but also functions as a device for receptor-mediated endocytosis, an essential step that allows the B cell to process the acquired antigen and convert it into a signal that sends out a call for assistance by T lymphocytes. This antigen-presentation function of B cells is described in later sections.
heavy-chain locus on the other chromosome and so mediates allelic exclusion. In the course of proliferation, the synthesis of $\lambda 5$ and VpreB is shut off (step 2), resulting in "dilution" of the available surrogate light chains and reduced expression of the pre-BCR. As a result, rearrangement of the light-chain loci can proceed (step 3). If this rearrangement is productive, the B cell can synthesize light chains and complete assembly of the B-cell receptor (BCR), which consists of a membrane-bound IgM and associated $\operatorname{Ig} \alpha$ and $\operatorname{Ig} \beta$. The B cell is now responsive to antigen-specific stimulation.

## During an Adaptive Response, B Cells Switch from Making Membrane-Bound Ig to Making Secreted Ig

As just described, the B-cell receptor, a membrane-bound IgM, provides a B cell with the ability to recognize a particular antigen, an event that triggers clonal selection and proliferation of that B cell, thus increasing the number of B cells specific for that antigen (see Figure 23-12). However, key functions of immunoglobulins, such as neutralization of antigens or killing of bacteria, require that those products be released by the B cell, so that they can accumulate in the extracellular environment and act at a distance from the site where they were produced.

Whether to synthesize membrane-bound or secreted immunoglobulin is a choice made by the B cell during processing of the heavy-chain primary transcript. As shown in Figure 23-19, the $\mu$ locus contains two exons (TM1 and TM2) that together encode a C-terminal domain that anchors IgM in the plasma membrane. One polyadenylation site is found upstream of these exons; a second polyadenylation site is

![li19335345559](li19335345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-19 Synthesis of secreted and membrane IgM. The organization of the $\mu$ heavy-chain primary transcript is shown at the top: $C \mu 4$ is the exon encoding the fourth $\mu$ constant-region domain; $\mu_{r}$ is a coding sequence unique for secreted $\operatorname{IgM}$; TM1 and TM2 are exons that specify the transmembrane domain of the $\mu$ chain. Whether secreted or membrane-bound $\operatorname{IgM}$ is made depends on which poly $(\mathrm{A})$ site is selected during processing of the primary transcript. (a) If the upstream
poly(A) site is used, the resulting mRNA includes the entire $C \mu 4$ exon and specifies the secreted form of the $\mu$ chain. (b) If the downstream poly(A) site is used, a splice donor site in the $C \mu 4$ exon allows splicing to the transmembrane exons, yielding a mRNA that encodes the membrane-bound form of the $\mu$ chain. Similar mechanisms generate secreted and membrane-bound forms of other Ig isotypes. $S S=$ signal sequence.
present downstream. If the downstream poly(A) site is chosen, then further processing yields an mRNA that encodes the membrane-bound form of $\mu$. (As described above, this choice is necessary for formation of the B-cell receptor, which includes membrane-bound IgM.) If the upstream $\operatorname{poly}(\mathrm{A})$ site is chosen, processing yields the secreted version of the $\mu$ chain. Similar arrangements are found for the other Ig constant-region gene segments ( $\gamma, \alpha, \varepsilon$ ), each of which can specify either a membrane-bound or a secreted heavy chain. The ability to switch between the membrane-anchored and the secreted form of immunoglobulin heavy chains by alternative use of polyadenylation sites (not by alternative splicing) is so far unique to this family of gene products.

The capacity to switch from the synthesis of exclusively membrane-bound immunoglobulin to the synthesis of secreted immunoglobulin is acquired by B cells in the course of their differentiation. Terminally differentiated B cells, called plasma cells, are devoted almost exclusively to the synthesis of secreted antibodies (see Figure 23-7). Each plasma cell synthesizes and secretes several thousand antibody molecules per second. It is this ramped-up production of secreted antibodies that underlies the effectiveness of the adaptive immune response in eliminating a pathogen and protecting against subsequent infection with the same pathogen. The protective value of antibodies is proportional to the concentration at which they are present in the circulation. Indeed, circulating antibody levels are often used as the key parameter to determine whether vaccination against a particular pathogen has been successful. The ability of plasma cells to secrete large amounts of immunoglobulins requires a massive expansion of the endoplasmic reticulum, a hallmark of plasma cells. The unfolded-protein response (see Chapter 13)
is initiated in B cells as an essential physiological mechanism to expand the ER and prepare the differentiating B cell for its future task as a highly active secretory cell. Interference with the unfolded-protein response abolishes the ability of B cells to turn into plasma cells.

## B Cells Can Switch the Isotype of Immunoglobulin They Make

In the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus, the exons that encode the $\mu$ chain lie immediately downstream of the rearranged VDJ exon (Figure 23-20, top). They are followed by exons that specify the $\delta$ chain. Transcription of a newly rearranged immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus yields a single primary transcript that includes the $\mu$ and $\delta$ constant regions. The splicing of this large transcript determines whether a $\mu$ chain or a $\delta$ chain will be produced. Downstream of the $\mu$ and $\delta$ exons are the exons that encode all the other heavy-chain isotypes. Upstream of each cluster of exons (with the exception of the $\delta$ locus) encoding one of the different isotypes is a repetitive sequence (switch region) that is recombination-prone, presumably because of its repetitive nature. Because each B cell necessarily starts out with surface IgM, recombination involving these sites, if it occurs, results in class switching from IgM to one of the other isotypes encoded downstream in the array of constant-region genes (see Figure 23-20). The intervening DNA is deleted.

In the course of its differentiation, a B cell can switch Ig classes sequentially. Importantly, the light chain is not affected by this process, nor is the rearranged VDJ segment with which the B cell started out on this pathway. Class-switch recombination thus generates antibodies with

![li19435345559](li19435345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-20 Class-switch recombination in the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus. Class-switch recombination involves switch sites, which are repetitive sequences (colored circles) upstream of each of the heavy-chain constant-region genes. Recombination requires activation-induced deaminase (AID) as well as cytokines (e.g., IL-4) produced by certain helper T cells. Recombination eliminates
the segment of DNA between the switch site upstream of $\mu$ exons and the constant region to which switching occurs. Class switching generates antibody molecules with the same specificity for antigen as that of the IgM-bearing B cell that mounted the original response, but with different heavy-chain constant regions and therefore different effector functions.
different constant regions, but identical antigenic specificity because the variable region has not changed. Each immunoglobulin isotype is characterized by its own unique constant region. As discussed previously, these constant regions determine the functional properties of the various isotypes. Class-switch recombination is dependent on the activity of activation-induced deaminase (AID) and on the presence of antigen as well as on helper T cells. Somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination occur concurrently, and their combined effect allows fine-tuning of the adaptive immune response with respect to the affinity of the antibodies produced and the effector functions employed.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.3

## Generation of Antibody Diversity and B-Cell Development

- Functional antibody-encoding genes are generated by somatic rearrangement of multiple DNA segments at the heavy-chain and light-chain loci. These rearrangements involve V and J segments for immunoglobulin light chains and V, D, and J segments for immunoglobulin heavy chains (see Figure 23-15).
- Rearrangement of immunoglobulin gene segments is controlled by conserved recombination signal sequences (RSSs) composed of heptamers and nonamers separated by 12- or 23-bp spacers (see Figure 23-16). Only those segments that have spacers of different lengths can rearrange successfully: two segments to be joined must possess a 12- and a 23-bp spacer, not two of identical length.
- The molecular machinery that carries out the rearrangement process includes proteins made only in lymphocytes
(recombinases RAG1 and RAG2), but other proteins that are used in other types of cells participate in nonhomologous end joining of DNA molecules.
- Antibody diversity is created by the random selection of Ig gene segments to be recombined and by the ability of the heavy and light chains produced from rearranged Ig genes to associate with many different light chains and heavy chains, respectively.
- Junctional imprecision generates additional antibody diversity at the joints of the gene segments brought together by somatic gene rearrangements.
- Further antibody diversity arises after B cells encounter antigen as a consequence of somatic hypermutation, which can lead to the selection and proliferation of B cells producing the highest-affinity antibodies, a process termed affinity maturation.
- During B-cell development, heavy-chain genes are rearranged first, leading to expression of the pre-B-cell receptor. Subsequent rearrangement of light-chain genes results in assembly of an IgM membrane-bound B-cell receptor (see Figure 23-18).
- Only one of the allelic copies of the heavy-chain locus and of the light-chain locus is rearranged (allelic exclusion), ensuring that a B cell expresses Ig with a single antigenic specificity.
- Polyadenylation at different poly(A) sites in an Ig primary transcript determines whether the membrane-bound or secreted form of an antibody is produced (see Figure 23-19).
- During an immune response, class switching allows B cells to adjust the class of antibody made, and thus the effector functions of the immunoglobulins produced, while retaining the antibody's specificity for antigen (see Figure 23-20).

### 23.4 The MHC and Antigen Presentation

Antibodies can recognize antigen without the involvement of other molecules; the presence of antigen and antibody is sufficient for their interaction. In the course of their differentiation, B cells receive assistance from T cells by a process that will be described in some detail below. This process, literally called T-cell help, is antigen-specific, and the T cells responsible for providing it are helper T cells. Although antibodies contribute to the elimination of bacterial and viral pathogens, it may also be necessary to destroy infected host cells, which might serve as a source of new virus particles. This task is carried out by cytotoxic T cells. Both helper T cells and cytotoxic T cells make use of antigen-specific receptors encoded by genes that are generated by mechanisms analogous to those used by B cells to generate immunoglobulin genes-including gene rearrangements. However, T cells recognize their cognate antigens in a manner very different from that used by B cells. The antigen-specific receptors on T cells recognize short snippets of protein antigens, but can do so only when the snippets are part of a glycoprotein complex present on the external surface of an "antigenpresenting" cell. The genes that encode the membrane glycoprotein complex that presents the antigen snippets are present in a region of genomic DNA called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Various antigen-presenting cells, in the course of their normal activity, digest pathogenderived proteins (as well as their own proteins) and then "present" physical complexes consisting of an MHC protein bound to a protein snippet (peptide) on their cell surface. T cells can scrutinize these complexes, and if they detect a pathogen-derived peptide bound to the MHC molecule, the T cells take appropriate action, which may include killing the cell that carries the MHC-peptide complex. In this section, we describe the MHC and the proteins it encodes, then examine how MHC molecules are involved in antigen presentation and antigen recognition by T cells.

## The MHC Determines the Ability of Two Unrelated Individuals of the Same Species to Accept or Reject Grafts

The major histocompatibility complex was discovered, as its name implies, as the genetic locus that controls acceptance or rejection of tissue grafts. At a time when tissue culture had not yet been developed to the stage where tumor-derived cell lines could be propagated in the laboratory, investigators relied on serial passage of tumor tissue in vivo (that is, transplanting a tumor from one mouse to another). It was quickly observed that a tumor that arose spontaneously in one inbred strain of mice could be propagated successfully in the strain in which it arose, but not in a genetically distinct strain of mice. Genetic analysis soon showed that a single major genetic locus was responsible for this behavior. Similarly, transplantation of healthy skin was feasible within the same strain of mice, but not when the recipient was of a
genetically distinct background. Genetic analysis of transplant rejection likewise identified a single major locus-the same one responsible for tumor rejection-that controlled acceptance or rejection, which is an immune reaction. As we now know, all vertebrates that possess an adaptive immune system have a genetic region that corresponds to the major histocompatibility complex as originally defined in the mouse.

In mice, the genetic region responsible for graft rejection is called the H-2 complex (Figure 23-21a). In humans, the genetic region encoding the MHC was uncovered during the study of patients who underwent multiple blood transfusions that provoked an immune response. The human MHC region is called the HLA complex (Figure 23-21b). The typical mammalian MHC contains dozens of genes, many encoding proteins of immunological relevance. All vertebrate MHCs encode a highly homologous set of proteins, although the details of organization and gene content show considerable variation between species, as seen for domestic chickens, mice, and humans. Most cells in vertebrates express MHC proteins and thus have the potential to present antigenic peptides for recognition by the immune system.

FIGURE 23-21 Organization of the major histocompatibility complex in mice and in humans. The major loci are depicted with schematic diagrams of their encoded proteins below. Class I MHC proteins are composed of an MHC-encoded single-pass transmembrane glycoprotein in noncovalent association with a small subunit, called $\beta 2$-microglobulin, which is not encoded in the MHC and is not membrane bound. Class II MHC proteins consist of two nonidentical single-pass transmembrane glycoproteins, both of which are encoded by the MHC.

Interestingly, the human fetus may be considered a tissue graft in the mother: the fetus shares only half of its genetic material with the mother, the other half being contributed by the father. Antigens encoded by the paternal alleles may differ sufficiently from their maternal counterparts to elicit an immune response in the mother. Such a response can occur because in the course of pregnancy, fetal cells that slough off into the maternal circulation can stimulate the maternal immune system to mount an antibody response against the paternal antigens. We now know that these antibodies recognize proteins encoded by the human MHC. The fetus itself is spared rejection because of the specialized organization of the placenta, which prevents initiation of an immune response by the mother against fetal tissue.

## The Killing Activity of Cytotoxic T Cells Is Antigen Specific and MHC Restricted

Clearly MHC molecules did not evolve to prevent the exchange of surgical grafts. MHC molecules play an essential role in the recognition of virus-infected cells by cytotoxic T cells, which are also called cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs). In virus-infected cells, MHC molecules interact with protein fragments derived from the virus and display these fragments on the cell surface, where CTLs, charged with eliminating the infection, can recognize them. How such fragments of antigen are generated and displayed will be described below. CTLs that have receptors capable of recognizing a particular peptide-MHC complex unleash a payload of lethal molecules onto the infected target cells, destroying the target-cell membranes. The destruction of these target cells can be readily measured by the release of their cytoplasmic contents when they physically disintegrate. Thus CTL killing of infected host cells requires (1) MHC presentation of antigenic peptides from the pathogen on the host cell surface, (2) CTLs expressing antigen-MHC-specific T-cell receptors on their surface that can recognize the MHC-antigen complex, and (3) the activation of the CTL killing machinery once the T-cell receptors have bound to the MHC-antigen complex.

Mice that have recovered from a particular viral infection are a ready source of CTLs that can recognize and kill target cells infected with the same virus. If CTLs are obtained from a mouse that has successfully cleared an infection with influenza virus, cytotoxic activity is observed against influenza-infected target cells, but not against uninfected controls (Figure 23-22). Moreover, the influenza-specific CTLs will not kill target cells infected with a different virus, such as vesicular stomatitis virus. CTLs can even discriminate between closely related strains of influenza virus, and can do so with pinpoint precision: differences of a single amino acid in the viral antigen may suffice to prevent recognition and killing by CTLs. These experiments show that CTLs are truly antigen specific and do not simply recognize some attribute that is shared by all virus-infected cells, regardless of the identity of the virus.

In this example, it is assumed that the CTLs harvested from an influenza-immune mouse are assayed on influenzainfected target cells derived from the same strain of mouse (strain a). However, if target cells from a completely unrelated strain of mouse (strain b) are infected with the same strain of influenza and used as targets, the CTLs from the strain a mouse are unable to kill the infected strain b target cells (see Figure 23-22b, $\mathbf{\square}$ vs. $\boldsymbol{\square}$ ). It is therefore not sufficient that the antigen (an influenza-derived protein) is present; recognition of the antigen by CTLs is restricted by mouse strain-specific elements. Genetic mapping has shown that these restricting elements are encoded by genes in the MHC. Thus CTLs from one mouse strain that is immune to influenza will kill influenza-infected target cells from another mouse strain only if the two strains match at the MHC loci for the relevant MHC molecules. This phenomenon is therefore known as MHC restriction, and the MHC molecules involved are called restriction elements.

## T Cells with Different Functional Properties Are Guided by Two Distinct Classes of MHC Molecules

The MHC encodes two types of glycoproteins essential for immune recognition, commonly called class I and class II MHC molecules. A comparison of the genetic maps of the mouse and human MHCs shows the presence of several class I MHC genes and several class II MHC genes, even though their arrangement shows variation between the two species (see Figure 23-21). In addition to the class I and class II MHC molecules, the MHC encodes key components of the antigen-processing (e.g., proteolysis) and presentation machinery. Finally, the typical vertebrate MHC also encodes components of the complement cascade.

Both class I and class II MHC proteins are involved in presenting antigen to T cells, but they serve two broadly distinct functions. Class I MHC products present antigens to cytotoxic T cells, licensing them to destroy infected cells. Cytotoxic T cells use class I MHC molecules as their principal restriction elements. These T cells are characterized by the expression of CD8, a surface glycoprotein that determines the ability of the T cells that carry it to interact with class I MHC products. Most, if not all, nucleated cells constitutively express class I MHC molecules, and many can support replication of viruses. Cytotoxic T cells then recognize and kill the infected cells via surface-displayed class I MHC molecules that display virus-derived antigen (peptide).

Class II MHC products are found exclusively on specialized antigen-presenting cells, also called professional APCs. These APCs present antigens via class II MHC molecules to a class of T lymphocytes called helper T cells. This presentation is the start of an adaptive immune response that also enables cytotoxic T cells to kill their targets and assists B cells in producing antigen-specific antibodies. B cells cannot undergo final differentiation into antibody-secreting

Target cells obtained from mice of the same strain are infected with the identical virus or left uninfected. After infection, cellular proteins are labeled nonspecifically by incubation of the target-cell suspension with ${ }^{51} \mathrm{Cr}$. When the radiolabeled target cells are incubated with the suspension of cytotoxic T cells, the killing of infected target cells results in release of the ${ }^{51} \mathrm{Cr}$-labeled
plasma cells without assistance from helper T cells. Helper T cells express a surface glycoprotein called CD4 and use class II MHC molecules as restriction elements. The constitutive expression of class II MHC molecules is confined to professional APCs, which include B cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. (Several other cell types, such as some

epithelia, can be induced to express class II MHC molecules under specific circumstances, but we will not discuss them.) Again, the underlying cell biology that describes the expression, assembly, and mode of antigen presentation by class II MHC molecules fits this functional specialization rather neatly, as we shall see below.

FIGURE 23-23 Three-dimensional structure of class I and class II MHC molecules. (a) Shown here is the structure of a class I MHC molecule with bound antigenic (HA) peptide as determined by x-ray crystallography. The portion of a class I MHC molecule that binds a peptide consists of a $\beta$ sheet composed of eight $\beta$ strands and flanked by two $\alpha$ helices. The peptide-binding cleft is formed entirely from the MHC-encoded large subunit, which associates noncovalently with the small subunit ( $\beta 2$-microglobulin) encoded elsewhere. (b) Class II MHC molecules are structurally similar to class I molecules, but with several important distinctions. Both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of class II MHC molecules are MHC encoded and contribute to formation of the peptide-binding cleft. The peptide-binding cleft of class II MHC molecules accommodates a wider range of peptide sizes than that of class I molecules. The extracellular portions of class I and class II MHC products, both of which are type I membrane proteins, contain a transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic tail (see Figures 23-21, 23-26, and 23-29), not included in the crystallographic analysis. [Part (a) data from D. N. Garboczi, 1996, Nature 384:134, PDB ID 1ao7. Part (b) data from J. Hennecke et al., 2000, EMBO J. 19:5611, PDB ID 1 fyt.]

The two major groups of functionally distinct T lymphocytes-cytotoxic T cells and helper T cells-can thus be distinguished by the unique profile of membrane proteins displayed at the cell surface and by the MHC molecules they use as restriction elements:

- Cytotoxic T cells: CD8 marker; class I MHC restricted
- Helper T cells: CD4 marker; class II MHC restricted

Both CD4 and CD8, along with many other proteins of the immune system, including the B-cell and T-cell receptors and the polymeric IgA receptor, belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily of proteins, all of which have one or more Ig domains. The molecular basis for the strict correlation between expression of CD8 and use of class I MHC molecules as the restriction element, or between expression of CD4 and use of class II MHC molecules as the restriction element, will become evident once the structure and mode of action of MHC molecules has been described.

## MHC Molecules Bind Peptide Antigens and Interact with the T-Cell Receptor

Both class I and class II MHC molecules are highly polymorphic; that is, many allelic variants exist among individuals of the same species. The vertebrate immune system can respond to these allelic differences, and its ability to recognize allelic MHC variants is the underlying immunological cause for rejection of transplants that involve unrelated, genetically distinct individuals. Yet the two classes of MHC molecules are also structurally similar in many respects, as are their interactions with peptides and the T-cell receptor (Figure 23-23).

There are many polymorphisms (genetic differences comprising multiple allelic variants at a given locus) in the genes that encode class I and class II MHC molecules. There are more than 2000 distinct alleles for all human MHC products
(a) Class I MHC molecule

HA peptide
![li20235345559](li20235345559.jpg)
(b) Class II MHC molecule
![li20335345559](li20335345559.jpg)
combined. MHC molecules are particularly important for recognizing "self" tissue and distinguishing it from "nonself" (and thus possibly pathogenic) substances. In general, except for close relatives, any two individuals have a very low chance of sharing the same MHC variants. Any interindividual differences in MHC molecules in a graft recipient

and donor will be recognized by the recipient's immune system, which will treat the graft as foreign and eliminate it (graft rejection). The greater the similarity in the set of MHC alleles of a donor and a transplant recipient, the greater the chance that the transplant will be accepted. This is why surgeons look for an MHC "matched" individual to donate an organ. If the tissue type (MHC alleles) of the donor does not exactly match that of the recipient, it is necessary to use drugs that suppress the immune responses of the recipient to prevent organ rejection.

The cell-biological mechanisms by which the immune system develops the capacity to distinguish "self" from "nonself" (or pathogenic from nonpathogenic) are complex, yet worth understanding. Understanding the molecular and cellular basis of immunity has enormous practical consequences for medicine and public health. We will therefore consider these molecular and cellular mechanisms in detail.

Class I MHC Molecules Class I MHC molecules, which belong to the Ig superfamily, consist of two polypeptide subunits. The larger subunit, for which there are multiple independent gene copies in the MHC region of mammalian genomes, is a type I membrane glycoprotein (see Figure 13-10). The smaller $\beta 2$-microglobulin subunit is not encoded by the MHC and corresponds in structure to an Ig domain. The larger subunits of class I MHC molecules in humans are encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C loci (see Figure 23-20), each of which displays extensive allelic variation among individuals. In the mouse, the larger subunits of class I MHC molecules are encoded by the H-2K and H-2D loci, each likewise with many known allelic variants.

The three-dimensional structure of a class I MHC molecule reveals two membrane-proximal Ig-like domains (see Figure 23-23a). These domains support an eight-stranded $\beta$ sheet topped by two $\alpha$ helices. Jointly, the $\beta$ sheet and the helices create a cleft, closed at both ends, in which a peptide binds. The mode of peptide binding by a class I MHC molecule requires that the peptide be about $8-10$ amino acids long, so that the ends of the peptide can be tucked into pockets that accommodate the charged amino and carboxyl groups at the termini. Further, the peptide is anchored into the peptide-binding cleft by means of a small number of amino acid side chains, each of which is accommodated by a pocket in the MHC molecule that neatly fits that particular amino acid residue (Figure 23-24a). On average, two such "specificity pockets" must be filled correctly to allow stable peptide binding, restricting binding to peptides with side chains that can fit into these pockets. In this manner, a given MHC molecule can accommodate a large number of peptides of diverse, yet circumscribed, sequence.

The polymorphic residues that distinguish one allelic MHC molecule from another are located mainly in and around the peptide-binding cleft. These residues therefore

![li20535345559](li20535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-24 Peptide binding and MHC restriction. (a) Peptides that bind to class I molecules are on average 8-10 residues in length, require proper accommodation of the termini, and include two or three residues that are conserved (anchor residues). Positions in class I molecules that distinguish one allele from another (polymorphic residues) occur in and around the peptide-binding cleft. The polymorphic residues in the MHC affect both the specificity of peptide binding and interactions with T-cell receptors. Successful "recognition" of an antigenic peptide-MHC complex by a T-cell receptor requires a good fit among the receptor, peptide, and MHC molecule. (b) Steric clash and a lack of complementarity between anchor residues and the MHC molecule prevent proper binding. T-cell receptors are thus restricted to binding specific peptide-MHC complexes.
determine the architecture of the peptide-binding pocket and hence the specificity of peptide binding. Further, these polymorphic residues affect the surface of the MHC molecule that makes contact with the T-cell receptor. A T-cell receptor that can interact with one particular class I MHC allele will therefore, as a rule, not interact with unrelated

MHC molecules because of their different surface architectures (Figure 23-24b); this is the molecular basis of MHC restriction. The CD8 molecule on cytotoxic T cells functions as a co-receptor, binding to conserved portions of the class I MHC molecule. The presence of CD8 thus "sets" the class I MHC preference of any mature T cell that bears it.

Class II MHC Molecules The two subunits ( $\alpha$ and $\beta$ ) of class II MHC molecules are both type I membrane glycoproteins of the Ig superfamily. The typical mammalian MHC contains several loci that encode class II MHC molecules (see Figure 23-21). Like the large subunit of class I molecules, both the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits of class II molecules show genetic polymorphism.

The basic three-dimensional design of class II MHC molecules resembles that of class I MHC molecules: two membrane-proximal Ig-like domains support a peptide-binding portion with a peptide-binding cleft (see Figure 23-23b). In class II MHC molecules, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits contribute equally to the construction of the peptide-binding cleft. This cleft is open at both ends and thus supports the binding of peptides longer than those that bind to class I MHC molecules because the peptides can protrude from both ends of the cleft. The mode of peptide binding involves pockets that accommodate specific peptide side chains as well as contacts between side chains of the MHC molecule and main-chain atoms of the bound peptide. As for class I MHC, class II MHC polymorphisms mainly affect residues in and around the peptide-binding cleft, so that peptide-binding specificity usually differs among different allelic products. A T-cell receptor that interacts with a particular class II MHC molecule will not, as a rule, interact with a different class II MHC allelic variant, not only because of the difference in the peptide-binding specificity of the allelic MHC molecules, but also because of the polymorphisms that affect the residues that contact the T-cell receptor; as for class I MHC, this is the basis for class II MHC restricted recognition of antigens.

As we will see below, class II MHC molecules evolved to present peptides generated predominantly in endosomes and lysosomes. Binding of peptides to a class II MHC molecule takes place in those organelles, and class II MHC molecules are targeted specifically to those locations after their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum. This targeting is accomplished by means of a chaperone called the invariant chain, a type II membrane glycoprotein (see Figure 13-10). The invariant chain (Ii) plays a key role in the early stages of class II MHC biosynthesis by forming a trimeric structure onto which three class II MHC $\alpha \beta$ heterodimers assemble. The final assembly product thus consists of nine polypeptides: $(\alpha \beta \mathrm{Ii})_{3}$. The interaction between Ii and the $\alpha \beta$ heterodimer involves a stretch of Ii called the CLIP segment, which occupies the class II MHC peptide-binding cleft. Once the $(\alpha \beta \mathrm{Ii})_{3}$ complex is assembled, the complex enters the secretory pathway and is diverted to endosomes and lysosomes
at the trans-Golgi network (see Figure 14-1). The signals responsible for this diversion are carried by the Ii cytoplasmic tail and do not obviously conform to the pattern of endosomal targeting or retrieval signals commonly found on lysosomal membrane proteins. Some of the $(\alpha \beta \mathrm{Ii})_{3}$ complexes are directed straight to the cell surface, from which they may be internalized, but the vast majority end up in late endosomes.

As we saw for class I MHC molecules and their CD8 coreceptor, the CD4 co-receptor recognizes conserved features on class II MHC molecules. Any mature T cell that bears the CD4 co-receptor uses class II MHC molecules for antigen recognition.

## Antigen Presentation Is the Process by Which Protein Fragments Are Complexed with MHC Products and Posted to the Cell Surface

The process by which foreign materials enter the immune system is the key step that determines the eventual outcome of an immune response. A successful adaptive immune response, which includes the production of antibodies and the generation of helper and cytotoxic T cells, cannot unfold without the involvement of professional APCs. It is these cells that acquire antigen, process it, and then display it in a form that can be recognized by T cells. The pathway by which antigen is converted into a form suitable for T-cell recognition is referred to as antigen processing and presentation.

The class I MHC pathway focuses predominantly on presentation of proteins synthesized by the cell itself (including pathogen-encoded proteins in infected cells), whereas the class II MHC pathway is centered on materials acquired from outside the APC. Recall that all nucleated cells express class I MHC products, or can be induced to do so; this makes sense in view of the fact that a nucleated cell is capable of synthesizing nucleic acids as well as proteins and can thus in principle sustain replication of a viral pathogen. The ability to alert the immune system to the presence of an intracellular invader is inextricably linked to class I MHCrestricted antigen presentation. The distinction between the presentation of materials synthesized by an APC itself and the processing and presentation of antigen acquired from outside the cell is by no means absolute. Together, the class I and class II pathways of antigen processing and presentation sample all of the compartments that need to be surveyed for the presence of pathogens.

Antigen processing and presentation in both the class I and class II pathways may be divided into six discrete steps that are useful in comparing the two pathways: (1) acquisition of antigen, (2) tagging the antigen for destruction, (3) proteolysis, (4) delivery of peptides to MHC molecules, (5) binding of peptide to a MHC molecule, and (6) display of the peptide-loaded MHC molecule on the cell surface. Here we describe the molecular details of each pathway.

## The Class I MHC Pathway Presents Cytosolic Antigens

Figure 23-25 summarizes the six steps in the class I MHC pathway using a virus-infected cell as an example.

- Acquisition of Antigen: In the case of a viral infection, acquisition of antigen is usually synonymous with the infected state. Viruses rely on host biosynthetic pathways to generate new viral proteins. Protein synthesis, unlike DNA replication, is an error-prone process, in which a fraction of newly initiated polypeptide chains are terminated prematurely or suffer from other errors (misincorporation of amino acids, frameshifts, improper or delayed folding). These mistakes in protein synthesis affect the host cell's own proteins and those specified by viral genomes equally. Such error-containing proteins must be rapidly removed so as not to clog up the cytoplasm, engage partner proteins in
nonproductive interactions, or even act as dominant negative versions of a protein. Properly folded proteins may also sustain damage that leads to their unfolding, completely or in part, and necessitates their removal. The rate of cytosolic proteolysis of these dysfunctional proteins must be matched to the rate at which mistakes in protein synthesis and folding occur. These proteins are an important source of the peptides destined for presentation by class I MHC molecules. With the exception of a specialized process called cross-presentation (discussed below), the class I MHC pathway results in the formation of peptide-MHC complexes in which the peptides are derived from proteins synthesized by the class I MHC-bearing cell itself.
Targeting Antigen for Destruction: For the most part, polyubiquitinylation is responsible for targeting a protein for destruction (see Chapter 3, page 99). Polyubiquitinylation is a covalent modification that is tightly regulated.
![li20635345559](li20635345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-25 Class I MHC pathway of antigen processing and presentation. Step Acquisition of antigen is synonymous with the production of proteins with errors (premature termination, misincorporation). Step Dysfunctional proteins are targeted for degradation by ubiquitinylation. Step Proteolysis is carried out by the proteasome. In cells exposed to interferon $\gamma$, the catalytically active $\beta$ subunits of the proteasome
are replaced by interferon-induced immune-specific $\beta$ subunits. Step Peptides are delivered to the interior of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via the dimeric TAP peptide transporter. Step Peptide is loaded onto newly made class IMHC molecules within the peptide-loading complex. Step The fully assembled class I MHC-peptide complex is transported to the cell surface via the secretory pathway. See text for details.

Proteolysis: Polyubiquitinylated proteins are destroyed by proteolysis in proteasomes. The proteasome is a protease that engages its substrates and, without the release of intermediates, yields peptides in the size range of 3-20 amino acids as its final digestion products (see Figure 3-31). During the course of an inflammatory response and in response to interferon $\gamma$, the three catalytically active $\beta$ subunits ( $\beta 1$, $\beta 2, \beta 5$ ) of the proteasome can be replaced by three immunespecific subunits: $\beta 1 \mathrm{i}, \beta 2 \mathrm{i}$, and $\beta 5 \mathrm{i}$. The $\beta 1 \mathrm{i}, \beta 2 \mathrm{i}$, and $\beta 5 \mathrm{i}$ subunits are encoded in the MHC region of the genome. The net result of this replacement is the generation of an immunoproteasome, the output (length of peptide products) of which is matched to the requirements for peptide binding by class I MHC molecules. The immunoproteasome adjusts the average length of the peptides produced as well as the sites at which cleavage occurs. Given the central role of the proteasome in the generation of the peptides presented by class I MHC molecules, proteasome inhibitors interfere potently with antigen processing via the class I MHC pathway.

- Delivery of Peptides to Class I MHC Molecules: Protein synthesis, polyubiquitinylation, and proteasomal proteolysis all occur in the cytoplasm, whereas peptide binding by class I MHC molecules occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Thus peptides must cross the ER membrane to gain access to class I molecules, a process mediated by the heterodimeric TAP complex, a member of the ABC superfamily of ATP-powered pumps (see Figure 11-15). The TAP complex binds peptides on the cytoplasmic face of the ER and, in a cycle that includes ATP binding and hydrolysis, translocates them into the ER. The specificity of the TAP complex is such that it can transport only a subset of all cytosolic peptides, primarily those in the length range of 5-10 amino acids, that are compatible with the circumscribed length of peptides that can fit into the class I MHC molecules. The mouse TAP complex shows a pronounced preference for peptides that terminate in leucine, valine, isoleucine, or methionine residues, which match the binding preference of class I MHC molecules. The genes encoding the TAP1 and TAP2 subunits composing the TAP complex are located in the MHC region.
- Binding of Peptides to Class I MHC Molecules: Within the ER, newly synthesized class I MHC molecules are part of a multiprotein complex referred to as the peptide-loading complex. This complex includes two chaperones (calnexin and calreticulin) and the oxidoreductase Erp57. Another chaperone (tapasin) interacts with both the TAP complex and the class I MHC molecule about to receive peptide. The physical proximity of TAP and the class I MHC molecule is maintained by tapasin. Once peptide loading onto the class I MHC molecule has occurred, a conformational change releases the loaded class I MHC molecule from the peptideloading complex. This arrangement effectively ensures that only peptide-loaded class I MHC molecules are released from the ER and then transported to and displayed at the cell surface. The overall efficiency of this pathway is such that approximately 4000 molecules of a given protein must be destroyed to generate a single MHC-peptide complex carrying a peptide from that particular polypeptide.
- Display of Class I MHC-Peptide Complexes at the Cell Surface: Once peptide loading is complete, the class I MHCpeptide complex is released from the peptide-loading complex and enters the constitutive secretory pathway (see Figure 14-1). Transfer from the Golgi to the cell surface is rapid and completes the biosynthetic pathway of a class I MHC-peptide complex.

The entire sequence of events in the class I pathway occurs constitutively in all nucleated cells, all of which express class I MHC molecules and the other required proteins, or can be induced to do so. As we have seen, exposure to cytokines such as interferon $\gamma$ can induce immune-specific proteasomal subunits to generate immunoproteasomes with enhanced ability to produce the appropriate peptides for presentation by class I MHC molecules. In the absence of a viral infection, protein synthesis and proteolysis continuously generate a stream of peptides that are loaded onto class I MHC molecules. Healthy, normal cells therefore display on their surfaces a representative selection of peptides derived from their own proteins. There may be several thousand distinct MHC-peptide combinations displayed at the surface of a typical nucleated cell. The display of MHC-self-peptide complexes on the surfaces of normal, uninfected cells plays an essential role in the immune system. It is not until a virus makes its appearance that virus-derived peptides begin to make a contribution to the display of peptide-MHC complexes on cell surfaces.

As we noted above, a properly functioning immune system must be able to distinguish self (nonpathogenic) antigens from nonself (potentially pathogenic) antigens. The small organ called the thymus-located near the sternum at the level of the heart in humans-plays a critical role in controlling the ability of the immune system to identify self and nonself. Developing T cells in the thymus, referred to as thymocytes, calibrate their antigen-specific receptors to the sets of MHC-peptide complexes generated on thymic epithelial cells and learn to recognize self-MHC products as the guideposts-or restriction elements, in immunological parlance-on which they must henceforth rely for antigen recognition. At the same time, the display of self peptides by self MHC molecules in the thymus enables the developing T cell to learn which peptide-MHC combinations are self-derived and must therefore be ignored to avoid a self-destructive autoimmune reaction. T-cell development is thus driven by self MHC molecules loaded with self peptides, a "template" on which a useful repertoire of T cells can be molded. Simply put, any T cell that bears a receptor that too strongly reacts with self-MHC-self-peptide complexes is potentially dangerous when it leaves the thymus and must be eliminated. This process of selection will be discussed below.

An exception to the usual mode of antigen presentation that is nonetheless crucial in the development of cytotoxic T cells is cross-presentation. This term refers to the acquisition by dendritic cells of apoptotic cell remnants, complexes composed of antigen bound to antibody, and possibly other forms of antigen, by phagocytosis. By a pathway that has yet to be fully understood, these materials escape from phagosomal or endosomal compartments into the cytosol, where they are then handled according to the steps described above. Dendritic cells are the most efficient at cross-presentation, and so allow the

loading of class I MHC molecules complexed with peptides that derive from cells other than the APC itself.

## The Class II MHC Pathway Presents Antigens Delivered to the Endocytic Pathway

Although class I MHC and class II MHC molecules show a striking structural resemblance, the manner in which the two classes acquire peptide and their function in antigen recognition differ greatly. Whereas the primary function of class I MHC molecules is to guide CD8-bearing cytotoxic T cells to their target (usually infected) cells, class II MHC molecules
serve to guide CD4-bearing helper T cells to the cells with which they interact, primarily professional APCs. Activated helper T cells provide protection not only by helping B cells to produce antibodies, but also by means of the complex sets of cytokines they produce, which activate phagocytic cells to clear pathogens or help set up an inflammatory response.

As noted previously, class II MHC molecules are expressed primarily by professional APCs: dendritic cells and macrophages, which are phagocytic, and B cells, which are not. Hence the class II MHC pathway of antigen processing and presentation generally occurs only in these cells. The steps in this pathway are depicted in Figure 23-26.

FIGURE 23-26 Class II MHC pathway of antigen processing and presentation. Step Particulate antigens are acquired by phagocytosis and nonparticulate antigens by pinocytosis or endocytosis. Step $\mathbf{B}$ Exposure of antigen to the acidic and reducing environment of endosomes and lysosomes prepares the antigen for proteolysis. Step The antigen is broken down by various proteases in endosomal and lysosomal compartments. Step $\mathbf{B}$ Class II MHC molecules, assembled in the ER from their subunits, are delivered to endosomal and lysosomal
compartments by means of signals contained in the associated invariant (II) chain. This delivery targets late endosomes, lysosomes, and early endosomes, ensuring that class II MHC molecules are exposed to the products of proteolytic breakdown of antigen along the entire endocytic pathway. Step Peptide loading is accomplished with the assistance of DM, a class II MHC-like chaperone protein. Step Peptide-loaded class II MHC molecules are displayed at the cell surface. See text for details.

- Acquisition of Antigen: In the class II MHC pathway, antigen is acquired by pinocytosis, phagocytosis, or receptor-mediated endocytosis. Pinocytosis, which is rather nonspecific, involves the delivery, by a process of membrane invagination and fission, of a volume of extracellular fluid and the molecules dissolved therein. Phagocytosis, the ingestion of particulate materials such as bacteria, viruses, and remnants of dead cells, involves extensive remodeling of the actin-based cytoskeleton to accommodate the incoming particle. Although phagocytosis may be initiated by specific receptor-ligand interactions, these are not always required: even latex particles and other particulates such as glass beads can be ingested very efficiently by macrophages. Pathogens decorated by antibodies and certain complement components are targeted to macrophages and dendritic cells, which recognize them by means of cell-surface receptors for complement components or for the Fc portion of immunoglobulins, then phagocytose them (Figure 23-27). Macrophages and dendritic cells also express several types of less selective receptors (e.g., C-type lectins, Toll-like receptors, scavenger receptors) that recognize molecular patterns in both soluble and particulate antigens; these cells then internalize the bound antigens by receptor-mediated endocytosis. B cells, which are not phagocytic, can also acquire antigens by receptor-mediated endocytosis using their antigen-specific B-cell receptors (Figure 23-28). Finally, cytosolic antigens may enter the class II MHC pathway via autophagy (see Figure 14-35).
- Targeting Antigen for Destruction: Proteolysis is required to convert intact protein antigens into peptides of a size suitable for binding to class II MHC molecules. Protein antigens are targeted for degradation by progressive unfolding, brought about by the drop in pH as proteins progress along the endocytic pathway. The pH of the extracellular environment is around pH 7.2 , and that in early endosomes is between pH 6.5 and 5.5 ; in late endosomes and lysosomes the pH may drop to pH 4.5. ATP-powered V-class proton pumps in the endosomal and lysosomal membranes are responsible for this acidification (see Figure 11-9). Proteins that are stable at neutral pH tend to unfold when they are exposed to extremes of pH through rupture of hydrogen bonds and destabilization of salt bridges. Furthermore, the environment in the endosomal or lysosomal compartment is a reducing one, in which lysosomes attain a concentration of reducing equivalents in the millimolar range. Reduction of the disulfide bonds that stabilize many extracellular proteins can also be catalyzed by a thioreductase inducible by exposure to interferon $\gamma$. The combined action of low pH and reducing environment prepares the antigens for proteolysis.
- Proteolysis: Degradation of proteins in the class II MHC pathway is carried out by a large set of lysosomal proteases, collectively referred to as cathepsins, which are either cysteine or aspartyl proteases. Other proteases, such as asparagine-specific endoprotease, may also contribute to proteolysis. A wide range of peptide fragments is produced, including some that can bind to class II MHC molecules. The lysosomal proteases operate optimally at the acidic pH

FIGURE 23-27 Presentation of opsonized antigen by phagocytic cells. By means of Fc receptors such as $\mathrm{Fc} \gamma \mathrm{R}$ displayed on their cell surface, specialized phagocytic cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells can bind and ingest pathogens that have been decorated with antibodies (opsonization). After digestion of the phagocytosed particle (e.g., immune complex, bacterium, virus), some of the peptides produced, including fragments of the pathogen (orange), are loaded onto class II MHC molecules (green). Class II MHC-peptide complexes displayed at the surface allow activation of T cells specific for these MHC-peptide combinations. Lipid antigens are delivered to the class I MHC-like molecule CD1 (pink), whose binding site is specialized to accommodate lipids. Certain pathogen-derived peptides (purple) may be delivered to class I MHC products (blue) by means of cross-presentation. The mechanisms that underlie cross-presentation remain to be clarified.

FIGURE 23-28 Antigen presentation by B cells. B cells bind antigen, even if present at low concentration, to their B-cell receptors, or surface Ig. The immune complex that results is internalized and then delivered to endosomal or lysosomal compartments, where it is destroyed. Peptides liberated from the immune complex, including fragments of the protein antigen, are displayed as class II MHC-peptide complexes at the cell surface.

within lysosomes. Consequently, agents that inhibit the activity of the V-class proton pumps that maintain their acidification interfere with antigen processing, as do inhibitors of lysosomal proteases.

- Encounter of Peptides with Class II MHC Molecules: Recall that most class II MHC molecules synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum are directed to late endosomes. The peptides generated by proteolysis reside in the same topological space as the class II MHC molecules themselves-they do not have to cross a membrane, as is the case for peptides destined to bind to class I MHC molecules (see Figure 23-25). To allow peptides and class II MHC molecules to meet, the $(\alpha \beta I)_{3}$ complex is transported via the secretory pathway to endosomal compartments.
- Binding of Peptides to Class II Molecules: The ( $\alpha \beta \mathrm{Ii})_{3}$ complex delivered to endosomal compartments is incapable
of binding peptide because the peptide-binding cleft in the class II molecule is occupied by the invariant chain (Ii). For the same reason, newly assembled $(\alpha \beta \mathrm{Ii})_{3}$ complexes do not compete for class I MHC-destined peptides delivered to the ER via TAP: their peptide-binding site is already occupied by Ii. Recall that the ER is where both class I and class II MHC molecules assemble. The presence of Ii in the nascent class II MHC complex ensures that class II MHC molecules do not bind peptide in the ER. The same proteases in endosomes and lysosomes that act on internalized antigens and degrade them into peptides also act on the $(\alpha \beta I i)_{3}$ complex, resulting in removal of the Ii molecule from the complex with the exception of a small portion called the CLIP segment. Because it is firmly lodged in the class II MHC peptide-binding cleft, CLIP is resistant to proteolytic attack. The class II MHC molecules themselves are also resistant to unfolding and proteolytic attack under the conditions that prevail in the endocytic pathway. The CLIP segment is removed from the $\alpha \beta$ heterodimer by the chaperone DM. The newly vacated peptide-binding cleft of the class II MHC molecule may now bind the peptides that are abundantly present in the endocytic pathway. Although the DM protein is MHC encoded and structurally very similar to class II molecules, it does not itself bind peptides. However, newly formed class II MHC-peptide complexes are themselves susceptible to further "editing" by DM, which may dislodge the peptide already bound, until the class II molecule acquires a peptide that binds so strongly that it cannot be removed by DM. The resulting class II MHC-peptide complexes are extremely stable, with estimated half-lives in excess of 24 hours.
- Display of Class II MHC-Peptide Complexes at the Cell Surface: The newly generated class II MHC-peptide complexes are localized mostly in late endosomal compartments, which include multivesicular endosomes (or bodies) (see Figure 14-33). Recruitment of the internal vesicles of the multivesicular bodies to the delimiting membrane expands their surface area: by formation of tubular membranes, laid down along tracks of microtubules, these compartments elongate and ultimately deliver class II MHC-peptide complexes to the surface by membrane fusion. These events are tightly regulated: tubulation and delivery of class II MHC molecules to the surface are enhanced in dendritic cells and macrophages following their activation by signals generated in response to infection, such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which is detected by Toll-like receptors on the surfaces of these professional APCs, as well as inflammatory cytokines, such as interferon $\gamma$, produced by CD4-expressing helper T cells.

For professional APCs, the above steps are constitutivehappening all the time-but they can be modulated by exposure to microbial agents and cytokines. In addition to the pathways described here for class I and class II MHC products, there is a category of class I MHC-related molecules, the CD1 proteins, that are specialized in the presentation of lipid antigens. The structure of a CD1 molecule resembles that of a class I MHC molecule: a larger subunit complexed with $\beta 2$-microglobulin. Many species of bacteria

produce lipids whose chemical structures are not found in their mammalian hosts. These lipids can serve as antigens when presented by CD1 molecules, to which they bind via a lipid-binding pocket that is conceptually similar to that of most MHC molecules. Signals in the cytoplasmic tail of the larger CD1 subunit target these molecules to endosomal or lysosomal compartments, where loading with antigenic lipids occurs. The CD1-lipid complexes engage a relatively rare class of T cells, referred to as NKT cells, as well as $\gamma \delta$ T cells, both described below. NKT cells fulfill an important role in cytokine production and help initiate and orchestrate adaptive immune responses via their cytokine outputs.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.4

## The MHC and Antigen Presentation

- The MHC, discovered as the genetic region responsible for acceptance or rejection of grafts, encodes many different proteins involved in the immune response. Two of these proteins, class I and class II MHC molecules, are highly polymorphic, occurring in many allelic variations (see Figure 23-21).
- The function of the class I and class II MHC proteins is to bind peptide antigens and display them on the surfaces of cells so that the antigen-MHC protein complex can interact with antigen-specific T-cell receptors on T cells. When an antigen-MHC protein complex on an antigen-presenting cell binds to its complementary T-cell receptor on a T cell, the T cell is activated to assume effector functions, such as the production of cytokines or the ability to kill a virus-infected cell. Class I MHC molecules are found on most nucleated cells, whereas the expression of class II MHC molecules is confined largely to professional APCs such as dendritic cells, macrophages, and B cells.
- The organization and structure of class I and class II MHC molecules is similar and includes a peptide-binding cleft that is specialized for binding a wide variety of peptides (see Figure 23-23).
- Different allelic variants of MHC molecules bind different sets of peptides because the differences that distinguish one allele from another include residues that define the architecture of the peptide-binding cleft (see Figure 23-24). Allelic variation also includes residues in the MHC molecule that directly contact the corresponding T-cell receptor. Thus different allelic variants of an MHC molecule, even if they bind the identical peptide, do not usually react with the same T-cell receptor. This phenomenon is called MHC restriction.
- Class I and class II MHC molecules bind to the peptides in different intracellular compartments: class I molecules bind predominantly to cytosolic materials, whereas class II molecules bind to extracellular materials internalized by phagocytosis, pinocytosis, or receptor-mediated endocytosis.
- The process by which protein antigens are acquired, processed into peptides, and converted into surface-displayed MHC-peptide complexes is referred to as antigen processing and presentation. This process operates continuously in cells that express the relevant MHC molecules, yet can be modulated in the course of an immune response.
- Antigen processing and presentation can be divided into six discrete steps: (1) acquisition of antigen; (2) targeting of the antigen for destruction; (3) proteolysis; (4) encounter of peptides with MHC molecules; (5) binding of peptides to MHC molecules; and (6) display of the peptide-loaded MHC molecules on the cell surface (see Figure 23-27).


### 23.5 T Cells, T-Cell Receptors, and T-Cell Development

T lymphocytes recognize antigen through specific interactions with MHC molecules. The diverse, antigen-specific T-cell receptors entrusted with this task are structurally and biosynthetically related to the $\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{ab})$ portion of immunoglobulins. To generate a large repertoire of antigen-specific T-cell receptors, T cells rearrange the genes encoding the T-cell receptor subunits by mechanisms of somatic recombination essentially identical to those used by B cells to rearrange immunoglobulin genes. And the development of T cells, like that of B cells, is strictly dependent on successful completion of these somatic gene rearrangements to yield a functional T-cell receptor. In this section, we describe the receptor subunits that mediate antigen-specific recognition, how they pair up with membrane glycoproteins essential for signal transduction, and how these complexes recognize MHC-peptide combinations.

As pointed out in the preceding section, an individual's T cells recognize peptide antigens only when they are bound to the polymorphic MHC molecules present in that individual. In the course of T-cell development, T cells must "learn" the identity of these "self" MHC molecules and receive instructions about which MHC-peptide combinations to ignore, so as to avoid potentially catastrophic reactions of newly generated T cells with the individual's own tissues (i.e., autoimmunity).

## The Structure of the T-Cell Receptor Resembles the F(ab) Portion of an Immunoglobulin

Much as B cells use the B-cell receptors on their surfaces to recognize antigens and generate intracellular signals that lead to clonal expansion, T cells depend on their T-cell receptors (TCRs) to initiate their participation in immune responses. T cells that have been activated via these antigenspecific receptors proliferate and acquire the capacity to kill antigen-bearing target cells (in the case of cytotoxic T cells) or to secrete cytokines that will assist B cells in their differentiation (in the case of helper T cells). The TCR recognizes antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules.

The TCR is composed of two glycoprotein subunits (Figure 23-29), each of which is encoded by a somatically rearranged gene. The receptor is composed of either an $\alpha$ and a $\beta$ subunit or a $\gamma$ and a $\delta$ subunit. The structure of these subunits is similar to that of the $\mathrm{F}(\mathrm{ab})$ portion of an immunoglobulin: at the N -terminal end is a variable region, followed by a constant region and a transmembrane segment. The cytoplasmic tails of the TCR subunits are short and do not directly interact with cytoplasmic signal transduction molecules. Instead, the TCR associates with the CD3 complex, a set of membrane glycoproteins composed of $\gamma, \delta, \varepsilon$, and $\zeta$ chains. (The TCR $\gamma$ and $\delta$ subunits are not to be confused with the similarly designated subunits of the CD3 complex.) The $\varepsilon$ chain forms a noncovalent dimer with the $\gamma$ or the $\delta$ chain to yield $\delta \varepsilon$ and $\gamma \varepsilon$ complexes. The extracellular domains of the CD3 subunits are homologous to immunoglobulin domains, and the cytoplasmic domain in each contains an ITAM (immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif), by which adapter proteins may be recruited upon phosphorylation of its tyrosine residues. The $\zeta$ chain is integrated into the CD3-TCR complex as a disulfide-bonded homodimer, and each $\zeta$ chain contains three ITAMs.

## TCR Genes Are Rearranged in a Manner Similar to Immunoglobulin Genes

Virtually all antigen-specific receptors generated by somatic recombination contain a subunit that is the product of V-D-J recombination (e.g., Ig heavy chain; TCR $\beta$ chain) and another that is the product of V-J recombination (e.g., Ig light chain; TCR $\alpha$ chain). The mechanism of V-D-J and V-J recombination for TCRs is essentially identical to that described for immunoglobulin genes and requires all the component proteins composing the nonhomologous end-joining machinery: RAG1, RAG2, Ku70, Ku80, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase, XRCC4, DNA ligase IV, and Artemis. Recombination signal sequences (RSSs) are required, and recombination obeys the 12/23-bp spacer rule (Figure 23-30).

A number of noteworthy features characterize the organization and rearrangement of the TCR loci. First, the organization of the RSSs is such that D-to-D rearrangements are allowed, unlike the case for Ig. Second, terminal

## FIGURE 23-29 Structure of the T-cell receptor and its

co-receptors. (a) The antigen-specific T-cell receptor (TCR) is composed of two chains, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits, which are produced by V-J and V-D-J recombination, respectively. The $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits must associate with the CD3 complex (see Figure 23-31) to allow the transduction of signals. The formation of a full TCR $\alpha \beta-C D 3$ complex is required for surface expression. The T-cell receptor further associates with a co-receptor, CD8 (light blue) or CD4 (light green), which allows interaction with conserved features of class I MHC or class II MHC molecules, respectively, on antigen-presenting cells.

FIGURE 23-30 Organization and recombination of TCR loci.
The organization of TCR loci is in principle similar to that of immunoglobulin loci (see Figure 23-15). Left: The TCR $\beta$-chain locus includes a cluster of V segments, a cluster of D segments, and several J segments, downstream of which are two constant regions. The arrangement of
the recombination signals is such that not only is D-J joining allowed, but also V-D-J joining. Direct V-J joining in the TCR $\beta$ locus is not observed. Right: The TCR $\alpha$-chain locus is composed of a cluster of V segments and a large number of J segments. $S S=$ exon encoding signal sequence; Enh = enhancer.
deoxynucleotidyltransferase (TdT) is active at the time the TCR genes are rearranged, and therefore N nucleotides can be present in all rearranged TCR genes. Third, in humans and mice, the TCR $\delta$ locus is embedded within the TCR $\alpha$ locus. This organization results in complete excision of the interposed $\delta$ locus when TCR $\alpha$ rearrangement occurs, so a choice of the TCR $\alpha$ locus for rearrangement precludes use of the $\delta$ locus, which is lost by deletion. T cells that express the $\alpha \beta$ receptor and those that express the $\gamma \delta$ receptor are
considered separate lineages with distinct functions. Among the T cells expressing $\gamma \delta$ receptors are some capable of recognizing the CD1 molecule, which is specialized for the presentation of lipid antigens. The $\gamma \delta \mathrm{T}$ cells are programmed to home in on distinct anatomic sites (e.g., the epithelium lining the genital tract, the skin) and probably play a role in host defense against pathogens commonly found at these sites.

Deficiencies in the key components of the recombination apparatus, such as the RAG recombinases, preclude

rearrangement of TCR genes. As we have seen for B cells, development of lymphocytes is strictly dependent on the rearrangement of the antigen-receptor genes. A deficiency in either RAG1 or RAG2 thus prevents both B-cell and T-cell development. Mice with homozygous RAG gene knockouts are frequently used to assess the roles of B and T cells in physiological and pathophysiological processes.

## Many of the Variable Residues of TCRs Are Encoded in the Junctions Between V, D, and J Gene Segments

The diversity created by somatic recombination of TCR genes is estimated to exceed $10^{10}$ unique receptors. Combinatorial use of different V, D, and J gene segments makes an important contribution to this diversity, as do the mechanisms of junctional imprecision and N-nucleotide addition already discussed for immunoglobulin gene rearrangements. The net result is a degree of variability in the V regions that matches that of the immunoglobulins (see Figure 23-13). Indeed, each of the TCR's variable regions includes three hypervariable regions (CDRs), equivalent to those in the BCR. Unlike immunoglobulin genes, however, the TCR genes do not undergo somatic hypermutation. Therefore, TCRs exhibit nothing equivalent to the affinity maturation of antibodies during the course of an immune response, nor is there the option of class-switch recombination or the use of alternative polyadenylation sites to create soluble and membrane-bound versions of the receptors.

The crystal structures of a number of TCRs bound to class I MHC-peptide or class II MHC-peptide complexes have been determined. These structures show variation in how the TCR docks with the MHC-peptide complex, but the most extensive contacts in the somatically diverse CDR3 region are made with the central peptide-containing portion of the complex, with the germ line-encoded CDR1 and CDR2 contacting the $\alpha$ helices of the MHC molecules. Many of the TCRs for which a structure has been solved dock diagonally across the peptide-binding portion of the MHC-peptide complex. As a result, the TCR makes extensive contacts with the peptide as well as with the $\alpha$ helices of the MHC molecule to which it binds. The positions at which allelic MHC molecules differ from one another are frequently those residues that directly contact the TCR, thus precluding tight binding of unrelated allelic MHC products.

Amino acid differences that distinguish one MHC allele from another also affect the architecture of the peptidebinding cleft. Even if the MHC residues that interact directly with the TCR were shared by two allelic MHC molecules, their peptide-binding specificity would probably differ because of amino acid differences in the peptide-binding cleft. Consequently, the TCR contact residues provided by bound peptide, which are essential for stable interaction with a TCR, would be absent from the "wrong" MHC-peptide combination. A productive interaction with the TCR would then be unlikely to occur.

## Signaling via Antigen-Specific Receptors Triggers Proliferation and Differentiation of T and B Cells

The immune responses mediated by T cells and B cells are initiated when their antigen-specific cell-surface receptors (TCRs or BCRs) are activated by binding to their respective ligands. The ligands for TCRs are MHC-peptide complexes expressed on the surfaces of APCs. The ligands for BCRs are antigens that bind to the receptors without the need for MHC intervention and do not need to be associated with a presenting cell. The activation of TCRs and BCRs by their antigens is similar to the activation of the signaling receptors we have already considered (G protein-coupled receptors, tyrosine kinase receptors; see Chapters 15 and 16) in that signal transduction cascades are activated. Several integral membrane proteins, as well as soluble cytosolic proteins, participate in TCR and BCR signaling. In some cases, these membrane-associated proteins can be thought of as auxiliary subunits of the receptors. Examples of how such auxiliary proteins participate in signaling are shown in Figure 23-31. The cytosolic portions of the antigen-specific receptors themselves are very short, do not protrude much beyond the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane, and are incapable of recruitment of downstream signaling molecules. Instead, as discussed previously, the antigen-specific receptors associate with auxiliary subunits that contain ITAMs. Engagement of the antigen-specific receptors by ligand initiates a series of receptor-proximal events: kinase activation, modification of ITAMs, and subsequent recruitment of adapter proteins that serve as scaffolds for recruitment of yet other downstream signaling molecules.

As outlined in Figure 23-31, engagement of the antigenspecific receptors by ligand activates Src-family tyrosine kinases (e.g., Lck in helper T cells; Lyn and Fyn in B cells). These kinases are found in close proximity to or physically associated with the antigen-specific receptors. The active kinases phosphorylate the ITAMs in the antigen-specific receptors' auxiliary subunits. In their phosphorylated forms, these ITAMs recruit and activate non-Src-family tyrosine kinases (ZAP-70 in T cells, Syk in B cells) as well as other adapter proteins. This recruitment and activation involves phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase $\mathrm{C} \gamma$ and PI-3 kinases. Subsequent downstream events parallel those described in Chapter 16 for signaling from receptor tyrosine kinases. Antigen-specific receptors on B and T cells are perhaps best characterized as "modular" receptor tyrosine kinases, with the ligand recognition units and kinase domains carried by separate molecules. Ultimately, signaling via antigen-specific receptors initiates transcription programs that determine the fate of the activated lymphocyte: proliferation and differentiation.

T cells depend critically on the cytokine interleukin 2 (IL-2) for clonal expansion. Following antigen stimulation of a T cell, one of the first genes to be turned on is that for IL-2. The T cell responds to its own initial burst of IL-2 and proceeds to make more IL-2, an example of autocrine

FIGURE 23-31 Signal transduction from the T-cell receptor (TCR) and B-cell receptor (BCR). The signal transduction pathways used by the antigen-specific receptors of T cells (left) and B cells (right) are conceptually similar. The initial stages are depicted in this figure;
downstream signaling events lead to changes in gene expression that result in proliferation and differentiation of the antigen-stimulated lymphocytes. See text for further discussion.

stimulation and part of a positive feedback loop. An important transcription factor required for the induction of IL-2 synthesis is the NF-AT protein (nuclear factor of activated $T$ cells). This protein is sequestered in the cytoplasm in phosphorylated form and cannot enter the nucleus unless it is dephosphorylated first. The phosphatase responsible is calcineurin, a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated enzyme. The initial rise in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ leading to activation of calcineurin results from mobilization of ER-resident $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores triggered by hydrolysis of $\mathrm{PI}(4,5) \mathrm{P}_{2}$ and the concomitant generation of $\mathrm{IP}_{3}$ (see Figure 15-34, steps ■-■).

$\mathbf{E}$
The immunosuppressant drug cyclosporine inhibits calcineurin activity through formation of a cyclosporine-cyclophilin complex, which binds and inhibits calcineurin. If dephosphorylation of NF-AT is suppressed, NF-AT cannot enter the nucleus and induce transcription of the IL-2 gene. This precludes clonal expansion of antigenstimulated T cells and so leads to immunosuppression, arguably the single most important intervention that contributes to the success of organ transplantation involving unrelated donors and recipients (individuals who are genetically different and therefore express different MHC products), referred to as allogeneic tissue transplantation. Although the success of transplantation varies with the organ used, the availability of strong immunosuppressants such as cyclosporine has expanded the possibilities of clinical transplantation enormously.

## T Cells Capable of Recognizing MHC Molecules Develop Through a Process of Positive and Negative Selection

The rearrangement of the gene segments that are assembled to encode a functional T-cell receptor is a stochastic event, completed on the part of the T cell without any prior knowledge of the MHC molecules with which its receptors must ultimately interact. As in somatic recombination of Ig heavy-chain loci in B cells, the first gene segments to be rearranged in the TCR $\beta$ chain are the D and J elements; a V segment is then joined to the newly recombined DJ (see Figure 23-30). At this stage of T-cell development, productive rearrangement allows the synthesis of the TCR $\beta$ chain, which is incorporated into the pre-TCR through association with the pre-T $\alpha$ subunit. This pre-TCR fulfills a function strictly analogous to that of the pre-BCR in B-cell development: it tells the T cell that it has successfully completed a productive rearrangement, with no need for further rearrangements in the genes on the homologous chromosome. The pre-TCR allows clonal expansion of the pre-T cells that successfully underwent rearrangement, and it imposes allelic exclusion to ensure that, as a rule, a single functional TCR $\beta$ subunit is generated for a given T cell and its descendants. RAG expression subsides until the expansion phase of the pre-T cells is complete, after which it is re-initiated to allow rearrangement of the TCR $\alpha$ locus, ultimately leading to the generation of T cells with a fully assembled TCR.

Figure 23-32 illustrates the analogous steps in the development of T and B cells.

How is the newly emerging repertoire of T cells, with their diverse pre-TCRs, further differentiated so that a productive interaction with self-MHC-peptide complexes can occur? The random nature of the gene rearrangement process and the enormous variability engendered as a consequence produces a large and diverse set of TCRs, the vast majority of which cannot interact productively with the host MHC products, and are therefore useless. The immune system has developed selection processes to eliminate those T cells that make TCRs incapable of a productive interaction with self-MHC-peptide complexes. Selection in the thymus also removes those T cells with TCRs that can strongly interact with self-MHC-self-peptide complexes because such T cells have the potential to be self-reactive, damaging normal healthy tissue (autoimmunity). T cells whose TCRs recognize peptide-MHC complexes in the thymus with an affinity that falls between these two extremes receive survival signals and are positively selected. Recall that antigen processing and presentation are constitutive processes, so that in the thymus, all self-MHC molecules are necessarily occupied with peptides derived from selfproteins. These combinations of self-peptides complexed to class I and class II MHC molecules constitute the substrate used by the set of newly generated T-cell receptors to determine what is "self" and ought to be ignored.

The heterogeneity of peptide-MHC complexes presented to T cells undergoing selection makes it highly probable that the T-cell receptor interprets signals not only in a qualitative (strength, duration) manner, but also in additive fashion: the summation of the binding energies of the different MHC-self-peptide combinations it encounters helps determine the outcome of selection. This phenomenon is called the avidity model of T-cell selection.

T cells are killed off by apoptosis only if the appropriate self antigen is represented adequately in the thymus in the form of MHC-peptide complexes. How does the immune system ensure that T cells generated in the thymus learn to ignore self antigens that are not normally expressed at that location? Proteins that are expressed in tissue-specific fashion or after the development of the thymus, such as insulin in the $\beta$ cells of the pancreas or the components of the myelin sheath in the nervous system, obviously fit this category. However, a factor called AIRE (autoimmune regulator) allows expression of such tissue-specific antigens in a subset of epithelial cells in the thymus. How AIRE accomplishes this is not known, but it is widely suspected of directly regulating the transcription of the relevant genes in the thymus and at select sites in secondary lymphoid organs. Defects in AIRE lead to a failure to express these tissue-specific antigens in the thymus. In individuals who do not express AIRE, developing T cells fail to receive the full set of instructions in the thymus that lead to the elimination of potentially selfreactive T cells. As a consequence, these individuals show a bewildering array of autoimmune responses, causing widespread tissue damage and disease.

FIGURE 23-32 Comparison of T-cell and B-cell development. Cell fate decisions are executed by receptors composed of either the newly rearranged $\mu$ chain (pre-BCR) or the newly rearranged $\beta$ chain (pre-TCR). The pre-BCRs and pre-TCRs serve similar functions: signaling clonal expansion of cells that have successfully undergone rearrangement and allelic exclusion. This phase of lymphocyte development does not require antigen recognition. Both the pre-BCR and pre-TCR include subunits unique to each receptor type and absent from the antigen-specific receptors found on mature lymphocytes: VpreB and

## T Cells Commit to the CD4 or CD8 Lineage in the Thymus

TCR gene rearrangement coincides with the acquisition of co-receptors. A key intermediate in T-cell development is a thymocyte that expresses both of the TCR co-receptors, CD4 and CD8, as well as a functional TCR-CD3 complex. These cells, called double positive (CD4CD8 ${ }^{+}$) cells, are found only as developmental intermediates in the thymus. As the T cells mature, they lose either CD4 or CD8 to become single-positive cells. The choice of which co-receptor (CD4 or CD8) to express determines whether a T cell will recognize class I or class II MHC molecules. The question of how a CD4CD8 ${ }^{+}$cell is instructed to become a CD8 (class I MHCrestricted) T cell or a CD4 (class II MHC-restricted) T cell is not entirely settled, but we know that the transcription factors ThPOK and Runx3 play fundamental roles. ThPOK and Runx3 are regulated by TCR signaling. Cells that transiently
$\Delta S$ (orange, green) for the pre-BCR; pre-T $\alpha$ (blue) for the pre-TCR. Upon completion of the expansion phase, expression of the gene encoding the remaining subunit of the antigen-specific receptor begins: $\lg$ light chain (light blue) for the BCR; TCR $\alpha$ chain (light red) for the TCR. Lymphocyte development and differentiation occur at distinct anatomic sites, and only fully assembled antigen-specific receptors (BCR, TCR) recognize antigen. Mature lymphocytes are strictly dependent on antigen recognition for their activation.
express ThPOK will commit to the CD4 lineage and repress Runx3 expression. On the other hand, if ThPOK expression is not induced, Runx3 expression is high, and cells commit to the CD8 lineage. In mice, a loss-of-function mutation in the ThPOK gene abrogates CD4 T-cell development, and all thymocytes become CD8-expressing T cells.

A third type of CD4 T cells also develop in the thymus, named natural (or thymically derived) regulatory T cells (Tregs), but their function differs from that of the classic, conventional CD4 helper T cells, as will be described below. The development and function of natural Tregs requires the transcription factor FoxP3, which is also regulated to some extent by TCR signaling. While the avidity model of T-cell selection also applies to the development of natural Tregs, the threshold for negative selection seems to be higher for natural Tregs: thymocytes that recognize self antigen with high affinity yet escape negative selection further commit to the natural Treg lineage. Finally, the thymus gives rise to

unconventional (and less numerous) types of T cells, such as invariant natural killer T cells (iNKT) that express the NK cell marker NK1.1 and are selected on the nonclassic MHC molecule CD1, which presents lipid antigens, as well as intraepithelial lymphocytes that will colonize the mucosal surfaces of the intestine. After the final stages of maturation, T cells of all types are exported to the peripheral lymphoid organs.

## T Cells Require Two Types of Signals for Full Activation

All T cells require a signal via their TCR for activation, but that signal is not sufficient: the T cell also needs co-stimulatory signals. To perceive these co-stimulatory signals, T cells carry on their surface several additional receptors, of which the CD28 molecule is the best-known example. CD28 interacts with CD80 and CD86, two surface glycoproteins on the professional APCs with which the T cell interacts. Expression of CD80 and CD86 increases when these APCs have themselves received the proper stimulatory signals, for example, by engagement of their Toll-like receptors (TLRs). The signals delivered to T cells via CD28 synergize with signals that emanate from the TCR when bound to its cognate self-MHC-peptide antigen complex, all of which are required for full T-cell activation (Figure 23-33).

T cells, once activated, also express receptors that provide an attenuating or inhibitory signal upon recognition of these very same co-stimulatory molecules, providing negative feedback regulation. The CTLA4 protein, whose expression in T cells is induced only upon activation, competes with CD28 for binding of CD80 and CD86. Because the affinity of CTLA4 for the CD80 and C86 proteins is higher than that of CD28, the inhibitory signals provided through CTLA4 will ultimately overwhelm the stimulatory signals coming via CD28. Co-stimulatory molecules can thus be stimulatory or-as was discovered later without adjusting the nomenclature-inhibitory, and they therefore provide an important means of controlling the activation status and duration of a T-cell response.

## Cytotoxic T Cells Carry the CD8 Co-receptor and Are Specialized for Killing

As we have seen, cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) generally express on their surfaces the TCR co-receptor glycoprotein called CD8. These $\mathrm{CD} 8^{+} \mathrm{T}$ cells kill target cells that display their cognate class I MHC-peptide combinations and do so with exquisite sensitivity: a single MHC-peptide complex suffices to allow a properly activated CTL to kill the target cell that bears it.

The mechanism of killing by CTLs involves two classes of proteins that act synergistically: perforins and granzymes (Figure 23-34). Perforins, which exhibit homology to the terminal components of the complement cascade composing the membrane attack complex, form pores up to 20 nm across in membranes to which they attach. The destruction of an intact permeability barrier, which leads to loss of

FIGURE 23-33 Signals involved in T-cell activation and its termination. The two-signal model of T-cell activation involves recognition of an MHC-peptide complex by the T-cell receptor, which constitutes signal 1 (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ), along with recognition of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, CD86) on the surface of an antigen-presenting cell, which constitutes signal 2 (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). If co-stimulation is not provided, the newly engaged T cell becomes unresponsive (anergic). The provision of both signal 1 via the T-cell receptor and signal 2 via engagement of CD80 and CD86 by CD28 allows full activation. Full activation, in turn, leads to increased expression of CTLA4 (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). After moving to the T-cell surface, CTLA4 binds CD80 and CD86, leading to inhibition of the T-cell response (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Because the affinity of CTLA4 for CD80 and CD86 is greater than that of CD28, T-cell activation is eventually terminated.

FIGURE 23-34 Perforin- and granzyme-mediated cell killing by cytotoxic T cells. Upon recognition of a target cell (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ), a cytotoxic T cell forms tight antigen-specific contact with the target cell. Tight contact results in the formation of a synaptic cleft, into which the contents of cytotoxic granules, including perforins and granzymes, are released (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Perforins form pores in the membranes onto which
electrolytes and other small solutes, contributes to cell death. Granzymes are delivered to and are presumed to enter the target cell, probably via the pores generated by perforin. Granzymes are serine proteases that activate caspases and so propel the target cell on a path of programmed cell death (apoptosis; see Chapter 21). Perforins and granzymes are packaged into cytotoxic granules, which are stored inside the cytotoxic T cell. Upon binding of the T-cell receptor to its cognate class I MHC-antigen complex, signal transduction from the TCR leads to release of the cytotoxic granules and their contents into the extracellular space that is formed between the cytotoxic T cell and the target cell, called the immunological synapse. How the T cell avoids being killed upon release of granzymes and perforins into the synapse is unknown. Natural killer cells also exert cytotoxic activity and likewise rely on perforins and granzymes to kill their targets (see Figure 23-6).

## T Cells Produce an Array of Cytokines That Provide Signals to Other Immune-System Cells

Many lymphocytes and other cells in lymphoid tissue produce cytokines. These small secreted proteins control lymphocyte activity by binding to specific cytokine receptors on the surface
they adsorb, and granzymes are serine proteases that enter through the perforin pores (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Perforins are believed to act not only at the surface of the target cell, but also at the surface of its endosomal compartments after the perforin molecules have been internalized from the cell surface (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ). Once in the cytoplasm, the granzymes activate caspases, which initiate programmed cell death (step $\mathbf{\square}$ ).
of a lymphocyte and initiating a transcriptional program that allows the lymphocyte to either proliferate or differentiate into an effector cell ready to exert cytotoxic (cytotoxic T cells), helper (helper T cells), or antibody-secreting activity (B cells). Cytokines that are produced by or act primarily on leukocytes are called interleukins; at least 35 interleukins have been recognized and molecularly characterized. Each type of interleukin receptor has some structural similarity to the others; those interleukins whose structures are most closely related can be recognized by their cognate receptors. The interleukin-2 receptor is particularly well characterized. Interleukin 2 (IL-2), a T-cell growth factor, is one of the first cytokines produced when T cells are stimulated. IL-2 acts as an autocrine (selfacting) and paracrine (acting on neighboring cells) growth factor and drives clonal expansion of activated T cells.

Interleukin 4 (IL-4), which is produced by helper T cells, induces activated B cells to proliferate and to undergo classswitch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Interleukin 7 (IL-7), produced by stromal cells in the bone marrow, is essential for development of T and B cells. Both IL-7 and IL-15 play a role in the maintenance of memory cells, which are antigen-experienced T cells that may be called upon when re-exposure to antigen occurs. These memory cells then rapidly proliferate and deal with the re-invading pathogens.

The receptors for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, and IL-15 all rely on a common subunit for signal transduction, the common $\gamma$ chain $\left(\gamma_{c}\right)$, with $\alpha$ (IL-2, IL-15) and $\beta$ subunits (IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-15) providing ligand specificity. Genetic defects in the $\gamma_{c}$ result in nearly complete failure of lymphocyte development, illustrating the importance of these cytokines not only during the effector phase of an immune response, but also in the course of lymphocyte development, where IL-7 in particular plays a key role.

The mechanism of signal transduction by cytokine receptors through the JAK/STAT pathway is described in Chapter 16 (reviewed in Figure 16-1). Among the many genes under the control of interleukins and the STAT pathway are those that encode suppressors of cytokine signaling, or SOCS proteins. These proteins, which are themselves induced by cytokines, bind to the activated form of JAKs and target them for proteasomal degradation (see Figure 16-13b).

## Helper T Cells Are Divided into Distinct Subsets Based on Their Cytokine Production and Expression of Surface Markers

CD4-expressing T cells are helper T cells that provide assistance to B cells and guide their differentiation into plasma cells. This function requires both the production and secretion of cytokines such as IL-4 as well as direct contact between the helper T cell and the B cell to which it provides help.

A second class of helper T cell has as its major function secreting the cytokines that contribute to the establishment of an inflammatory environment. Multiple subtypes of such inflammatory T cells are categorized based on the spectrum of different cytokines they produce and their respective roles in regulating immune responses. Whereas all activated T cells can produce IL-2, other cytokines are produced only by particular helper T-cell subsets. These helper T cells are classified as $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$ cells, which secrete interferon $\gamma$ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ cells, which secrete IL-4 and IL-10. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$ cells, through production of interferon $\gamma$, can activate macrophages and stimulate an inflammatory response. Referred to also as inflammatory T cells, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 1$ cells nonetheless play an important role in antibody production, notably facilitating the production of complement-fixing antibodies such as $\operatorname{IgG} 1$ and $\operatorname{IgG} 3$. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 2$ cells, through production of IL-4, play an important role in B-cell responses that involve class switching to the IgG1 and IgE isotypes (discussed above). Recall that in B cells, the induction of activation-induced deaminase (AID) prepares the B cell for class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. This induction is a consequence of the precise mixture of cytokines produced by helper T cells and the binding of a surface membrane protein on the activated T cell, CD40, to a protein on the B-cell surface, CD40 ligand (CD40L).

Conventional helper T cells can also differentiate into $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells, which produce IL-17, and into induced regulatory T cells (induced Tregs, distinct from the natural Tregs generated in the thymus). Both types of Treg cells attenuate immune responses by exerting a suppressive effect on other types of T cells. Natural Tregs restrain the activity of
potentially self-reactive T cells and are important in maintaining peripheral tolerance (the absence of an immune response to self antigens), whereas induced Tregs are believed to regulate excessively strong immune responses against foreign antigens. $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}} 17$ cells are important in defense against bacteria (extracellular bacteria in particular) and also play a pathogenic role in autoimmune diseases.

## Leukocytes Move in Response to Chemotactic Cues Provided by Chemokines

Interleukins tell lymphocytes what to do by eliciting a transcriptional program that allows lymphocytes to acquire specialized effector functions. Chemokines, on the other hand, tell leukocytes where to go. Many cells emit chemotactic cues in the form of chemokines. When tissue damage occurs, resident fibroblasts produce a chemokine, IL-8, that attracts neutrophils to the site of damage. The regulation of lymphocyte traffic within lymph nodes is essential for dendritic cells to attract T cells, and for T cells and B cells to meet. These trafficking steps are all controlled by chemokines.

There are approximately 40 distinct chemokines and more than a dozen chemokine receptors. One chemokine may bind to more than one receptor, and a single receptor can bind several different chemokines. This flexibility creates the possibility of generating a combinatorial code of chemotactic cues of great complexity. This code is used to guide the navigation of leukocytes from where they are generated, in the bone marrow, into the bloodstream for transport to their target destination.

Some chemokines direct lymphocytes to leave the circulation and take up residence in lymphoid organs. These migrations contribute to the population of lymphoid organs with the required sets of lymphocytes. Because these movements occur as part of normal lymphoid development, such chemokines are referred to as homeostatic chemokines. Those chemokines that serve the purpose of recruiting leukocytes to sites of inflammation and tissue damage are referred to as inflammatory chemokines.

Chemokine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that function as an essential component of the regulation of cell adhesion and cell migration. Leukocytes that travel through blood vessels do so at high speed and are exposed to high hydrodynamic shear forces. For a leukocyte to traverse the endothelium and take up residence in a lymph node or seek out a site of infection in tissue, it must first slow down, a process that requires interactions of glycoprotein surface receptors called selectins with their ligands on the surfaces of leukocytes, which are mostly carbohydrate in nature. If chemokines are adsorbed to the extracellular matrix, and if the leukocyte possesses a receptor for those chemokines, activation of its chemokine receptor elicits a signal that allows integrins carried by the leukocyte to undergo a conformational change. This change results in an increase in the affinity of the integrin for its ligand and causes firm arrest of the leukocyte. The leukocyte may now exit the blood vessel by a process known as extravasation (see Figure 20-40).

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.5

## T Cells, T-Cell Receptors, and T-Cell Development

- The antigen-specific T-cell receptors are dimeric proteins consisting of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits or $\gamma$ and $\delta$ subunits. T cells occur in at least two major classes defined by their expression of the glycoprotein co-receptors CD4 and CD8 (see Figure 23-29).
- Cells that use class I MHC molecules as the molecular guideposts for antigen recognition (restriction elements, in immunological parlance) carry CD8; those that use class II MHC molecules carry CD4. These classes of T cells are functionally distinct: CD8 T cells are cytotoxic T cells; CD4 T cells provide help to B cells and are an important source of cytokines.
- Genes encoding the TCR subunits are generated by somatic recombination of V and J segments ( $\alpha$ chain) and of $\mathrm{V}, \mathrm{D}$, and J segments ( $\beta$ chain); their rearrangement obeys the same rules as does rearrangement of Ig genes in B cells (see Figure 23-30). Rearrangement of TCR genes occurs when the lymphocytes are present in the thymus and only in those cells destined to become T lymphocytes.
- A complete T-cell receptor includes not only the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits responsible for antigen and MHC recognition, but also the accessory subunits referred to as the CD3 complex, which is required for signal transduction. Each subunit of the CD3 complex carries in its cytoplasmic tail one or three ITAM domains; when phosphorylated, these ITAMs recruit adapter proteins involved in signal transduction (see Figure 23-31).
- In the course of T-cell development, the TCR $\beta$ locus is rearranged first. If that locus encodes a functional $\beta$ subunit, it is incorporated with the pre-T $\alpha$ chain into a pre-TCR (see Figure 23-32). Like the pre-BCR, the pre-TCR mediates allelic exclusion, that is, the expression of a functionally rearranged T-cell receptor encoded by only one of the two alleles and proliferation of those cells that successfully underwent $\operatorname{TCR} \beta$ rearrangement.
- Developing T cells that fail to recognize self-MHC molecules die for lack of survival signals. T cells that interact too strongly with self-peptide-self MHC complexes encountered during development are instructed to die (negative selection); those that have intermediate affinity for self-peptide-self MHC complexes are allowed to mature (positive selection) and are exported from the thymus to the periphery.
- T cells are instructed where to go (cell migration) through chemotactic signals in the form of chemokines. Receptors for chemokines are G protein-coupled receptors that show some promiscuity in terms of their binding of chemokines. The complexity of chemokine-chemokine receptor binding allows precise regulation of leukocyte traffic, both within lymphoid organs and in the periphery.


### 23.6 Collaboration of Immune-System Cells in the Adaptive Response

An effective adaptive immune response requires the presence of B cells, T cells, and APCs. For B cells to execute class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutationprerequisites for production of high-affinity antibodiesthey require help from activated T cells. These T cells, in turn, can be activated only by professional APCs such as dendritic cells. Dendritic cells sense the presence of pathogens through TLRs and other pattern-recognition receptors, such as the C-type lectins that can recognize polysaccharides and carbohydrate determinants. The interplay between components of the innate and adaptive immune systems is therefore a very important aspect of adaptive immunity. This layered, interwoven nature of innate and adaptive immunity both ensures a rapid early response of immediate protective value and primes the adaptive immune system for a specific response to any persisting pathogen. In this section, we describe how these various elements are activated and how the relevant cell types interact.

## Toll-Like Receptors Perceive a Variety of Pathogen-Derived Macromolecular Patterns

An important part of the innate immune system is its ability to immediately detect the presence of a microbial invader and respond to it. This response includes direct elimination of the invader, but it also prepares the mammalian host for a proper adaptive immune response, particularly through activation of professional APCs. These APCs are positioned throughout the epithelia (airways, gastrointestinal tract, genital tract), where contact with pathogens is most likely to occur. In the skin, a network of dendritic cells called Langerhans cells makes it virtually impossible for a pathogen that breaches this barrier to avoid contact with these professional APCs. Dendritic cells and other professional APCs detect the presence of bacteria and viruses through members of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family. These proteins are named after the Drosophila protein Toll because of the structural and functional homology between them. Drosophila Toll was discovered because of its important role in dorsal/ ventral patterning in the fruit fly, but related receptors are now recognized as capable of triggering an innate immune response in insects as well as in vertebrates.

TLR Structure Toll itself and all TLRs possess a sickle-shaped extracellular domain, composed of leucine-rich repeats, that is involved in ligand recognition. The cytoplasmic portion of a TLR contains a domain responsible for the recruitment of adapter proteins to enable signal transduction. The signaling pathways engaged by TLRs have many of the same components (and outcomes) as those used by receptors for the cytokine IL-1 (Figure 23-35).

The Drosophila Toll protein interacts with its ligand, Spaetzle, itself the product of a proteolytic conversion initiated by components of the cell walls of fungi that prey on

![li21735345559](li21735345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-35 Toll-like receptor activation. The extracellular portions of TLRs recognize ligands of diverse chemical nature (nucleic acids, lipopolysaccharides). The cytoplasmic portions of the TLRs, called TIR (Toll/IL1 $\beta$ receptor homology) domains, associate with the adapter protein MyD88, present in six copies per complex, and recruit two types of kinases, both members of the IRAK family. These complex interactions are maintained by TIR domains and death domains (DD) as shown in the figure. The assembled complex on the cytoplasmic side is referred to as the myddosome. See J. Y. Kang and J.-O. Lee, 2011, Annu. Rev. Biochem. 80:917. [Data from M. S. Jin et al., 2007, Cell 130:1071, PDB ID 2z7x, and S. C. Lin et al., 2010, Nature 465:885, PDB ID 3mop.]

Drosophila. In the fly, activation of Toll unleashes a signaling cascade that ultimately controls the transcription of genes that encode antimicrobial peptides. The activated receptor at the cell surface communicates with the transcriptional apparatus by means of a series of adapter proteins that activate downstream kinases interposed between the TLRs and the transcription factors that are activated by them. A key step is the ubiquitin-dependent proteasomal degradation of the Cactus protein. Its removal allows the protein Dif to enter the nucleus and initiate transcription. This pathway is highly homologous in its operation and structural composition to the NF- $\kappa$ B pathway in mammals (see Figure 16-35).

Diversity of TLRs There are approximately a dozen mammalian TLRs that can be activated by various microbial products and are expressed by a variety of cell types. TLR function is crucial for the activation of dendritic cells and macrophages. Neutrophils also express TLRs. The microbial products recognized by TLRs include macromolecules found in the cell envelopes of bacteria, such as lipopolysaccharides, flagellins (subunits of bacterial flagella), and bacterial lipopeptides. Direct binding of at least some of these macromolecules to TLRs has been demonstrated in crystallographic analyses of the relevant complexes. The presence of distinct classes of microbial molecules is sensed by distinct TLRs: for example, TLR4 for lipopolysaccharides; heterodimers of TLR1 and 2 and TLR2 and 6 for lipopeptides; and TLR5 for flagellin. Recognition of all bacterial envelope components occurs at the cell surface.

A second set of TLRs—TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9—sense the presence of pathogen-derived nucleic acids. They do so not at the cell surface, but rather within the endosomal compartments where these receptors reside. Mammalian DNA is methylated at many CpG dinucleotides, whereas microbial DNA generally lacks this modification. TLR9 is activated by unmethylated, CpG-containing microbial DNA. Similarly, double-stranded RNA molecules present in some virus-infected cells lead to activation of TLR3. Finally, TLR7 responds to the presence of certain single-stranded RNAs. Thus the full set of mammalian TLRs allows the recognition of a variety of macromolecules that are diagnostic for the presence of bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogens and parasites such as malaria.

Inflammasome A variety of intracellular receptors for RNA and DNA that recognize viral RNA and are structurally distinct from TLRs have been described. The list of cytoplasmic receptors capable of recognizing DNA, both pathogen derived and host DNA derived, continues to grow. Several of these receptors participate in the assembly of the inflammasome (Figure 23-36), whose major function is the conversion of the enzyme precursor procaspase-1 to the active caspase-1. Caspase-1 is a protease that converts pro-IL-1 $\beta$ into active IL-1 $\beta$, a cytokine that elicits a strong inflammatory response. The core components of inflammasomes are proteins with leucine-rich repeats, members of the neuronal inhibitors of apoptosis (NALP) family of proteins,

![li21835345559](li21835345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-36 The inflammasome. The inflammasome is a type of complex that senses the presence of cytoplasmic pathogenderived nucleic acids and can also be activated by other danger signals, including particulate matter such as uric acid crystals or even asbestos. There are close to two dozen proteins that can participate in the formation of these complexes to yield inflammasomes of different composition, two of which are represented here schematically. Ultimately, the fully assembled inflammasome activates caspase-1, the enzyme that converts pro-IL-1 $\beta$ into the active, cleaved cytokine IL-1 $\beta$. NALP3 = a member of the protein family characterized by the presence of NACHT, LRR, and PYD domains; ASC = apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a CARD (caspase recruitment domain).
and the NOD proteins, so named because of the presence of a nucleotide oligomerization domain. Ipaf-1, a protein related to the Apaf-1 molecule involved in apoptosis (see Chapter 21), allows the recruitment of an adapter protein, ASC, to mediate complex formation with procaspase-1. Assembly of this multisubunit complex allows the conversion of procaspase-1 to active caspase-1 and of pro-IL-1 $\beta$ to IL-1 $\beta$. Many seemingly unrelated substances can induce assembly and activation of an inflammasome, including silica, uric acid crystals, and asbestos particles. Accordingly, inhibition of the inflammasome signaling cascade, or blocking of the receptor for IL-1 $\beta$, has shown therapeutic promise for a variety of inflammatory diseases.

TLR Signaling Cascade As shown in Figure 23-35, engagement of mammalian TLRs leads to recruitment of the adapter protein MyD88, which in turn allows the binding and activation of IRAK (interleukin 1 receptor-associated kinase) proteins. After IRAK phosphorylates TNF-receptorassociated factor 6 (TRAF6), several downstream kinases come into play, leading to release of active NF- $\kappa \mathrm{B}$, a transcription factor, for translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where NF- $\kappa$ B activates various target genes (see Figure 16-35). These target genes include those encoding IL-1 $\beta$ and IL-6, which contribute to inflammation, as well as the genes for TNF and IL-12. Expression of type I interferons, small proteins with antiviral effects, is also turned on in response to TLR signaling.

Cell responses to TLR signaling are quite diverse. For professional APCs, these responses include not only production of cytokines but also the up-regulation of co-stimulatory molecules, the surface proteins important for full activation of T cells that have yet to encounter antigen (referred to as naive T cells). TLR signaling allows dendritic cells to migrate from where they encounter a pathogen to the lymph nodes draining that area, where they can interact with naive lymphocytes. Not all activated TLRs evoke an identical response. In dendritic cells, each activated TLR controls production of a particular set of cytokines. For each engaged TLR, the combination of costimulatory molecules and the cytokine profile induced by TLR engagement creates a unique activated-dendritic-cell phenotype. The identity of the microbial antigen encountered by a dendritic cell determines the pattern of the TLRs that will be activated. This pattern, in turn, shapes the differentiation pathways of activated dendritic cells, influencing the cytokines produced, the surface molecules displayed, and the chemotactic cues to which the dendritic cells respond. The mode of activation of a dendritic cell and the cytokines it produces in response create a unique local microenvironment in which T cells differentiate. Within this microenvironment, the neighboring T cells acquire the functional characteristics required to fight the infectious agent that led to engagement of the TLRs in the first place.

## Engagement of Toll-Like Receptors Leads to Activation of Antigen-Presenting Cells

Professional APCs engage in continuous endocytosis, and in the absence of pathogens, they display at their surface class I and class II MHC molecules loaded with peptides derived from self proteins. In the presence of pathogens, the TLRs on these cells are activated, inducing the APCs to become motile: they detach from the surrounding substratum and start to migrate in the direction of the draining lymph node, following the directional cues provided by chemokines. An activated dendritic cell, for example, reduces its rate of antigen acquisition, up-regulates the activity of endosomal and lysosomal proteases, and increases the transfer of class II MHC-peptide complexes from the loading compartments to the cell surface. Finally, activated professional APCs upregulate expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, which will allow them to activate T cells more effectively. The initial contact of a professional APC with a pathogen thus results in its migration to the draining lymph node in a state that is fully capable of activating a naive T cell. Antigen is displayed in the form of peptide-MHC complexes, co-stimulatory molecules are abundantly present, and cytokines are produced that assist in setting up the proper differentiation program for the T cells to be activated.

Antigen-laden dendritic cells engage antigen-specific T cells, which respond by proliferating and differentiating. The cytokines produced in the course of this priming reaction determine whether a CD4-expressing T cell will polarize toward an inflammatory or a classic helper T cell phenotype.

If engagement occurs via class I MHC molecules, a CD8expressing T cell may develop from a precursor cytotoxic T cell into a fully active cytotoxic T cell. Activated T cells are motile and move through the lymph node in search of $B$ cells or enter the circulation to execute effector functions elsewhere in the body.

## Production of High-Affinity Antibodies Requires Collaboration Between B and T cells

To generate the high-affinity antibodies that are necessary for tight binding to antigens and effective neutralization of pathogens, B cells require assistance from T cells. B-cell activation requires both a source of antigen to engage the BCR and the presence of activated antigen-specific T cells.

Soluble antigen reaches the lymph node from the periphery by transport through the afferent lymphatic vessels (see Figure 23-7). Bacterial growth is accompanied by the release of microbial products that can serve as antigens. If the infection is accompanied by local tissue destruction, activation of the complement cascade results in the killing of bacteria and the concomitant release of bacterial proteins, which are also delivered via the lymphatic vessels to the draining lymph node. Antigens covalently modified by proteins of the complement system are superior to their unmodified counterparts in the activation of B cells through engagement of complement receptors on those cells, which serve as co-receptors for the B-cell receptor. B cells that acquire antigen via their BCRs internalize the antibody-antigen complex by endocytosis and process it for presentation via the class II MHC pathway. B cells that have successfully engaged antigen thus convert it into a call for T-cell help in the form of a class II MHC-peptide complex expressed on the cell surface (Figure 23-37, step 11). Note that the peptide on the antigen molecule recognized by the B-cell receptor may be quite distinct from the peptide ultimately displayed on the cell surface in association with a class II MHC molecule. As long as the B-cell epitope and the class II MHC-presented peptidea T-cell epitope-are physically linked, successful B-cell differentiation and antibody production can be initiated.

This concept of linked recognition-namely, the engagement of antigen by the B cell's BCR and the display of antigen-derived fragments to T cells by class II MHC molecules-explains why there is a minimum size for molecules that can be used to successfully elicit a high-affinity antibody response, as we will see below. Such immunogenic molecules must fulfill several criteria: they must contain the epitope that binds to the B-cell receptor, they must undergo endocytosis and proteolysis, and a proteolyzed fragment of the protein must bind to the allelic class II MHC molecules available in order to be presented as a class II MHC-peptide complex, which serves as a call for T-cell help.

Often investigators would like to generate an antibody (either polyclonal or monoclonal) that can recognize a short peptide fragment from a larger protein. Such antibodies can be used for a variety of experiments, including detection of a
target molecule by immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation. These antibodies are called anti-peptide antibodies. If the peptide alone is used as an immunogen (injected into an animal [e.g., a rabbit, goat, or mouse] to generate antibodies), it probably will not successfully induce robust antibody formation, even though there may be B cells with BCRs that can bind tightly to the peptide. The reason is that it is unlikely that those B cells will be able to generate a complex of a class II MHC with that same peptide that can recruit helper T cells to drive proliferation and affinity maturation. For this reason, synthetic peptides used to elicit antibodies are conjugated to carrier proteins to improve their immunogenicity; the carrier proteins serve as the source of peptides for presentation via class II MHC products. Only through recognition of such a class II MHC-peptide complex via its T-cell receptor can a T cell provide the help necessary for the B cell to run its complete course of differentiation leading to robust, high-affinity antibody production.

This concept applies equally to B cells capable of recognizing particular modifications on proteins or peptides. Antibodies that recognize the phosphorylated form of a kinase are commonly raised by immunization of experimental animals with the phosphorylated peptide in question, conjugated to a carrier protein. An appropriately specific B cell recognizes the phosphorylated site on the peptide of interest, internalizes the phosphorylated peptide and carrier, and generates a complex set of peptides by endosomal proteolysis of the carrier protein. Among these peptides, there should be at least one that can bind to the class II MHC molecules carried by that B cell. If properly displayed at the surface of the B cell, this class II MHC-peptide complex becomes the call for T-cell help, which is provided by helper T cells equipped with receptors capable of recognizing the complex of class II MHC molecule and carrier-derived peptide.

The helper T cell identifies, via its TCR, an antigenexperienced B cell by means of the class II MHC-peptide complex the B cell displays. The B cell also displays costimulatory molecules and receptors for cytokines produced by the activated T cell (e.g., IL-4). After interacting with T cells, these B cells proliferate. Some of them differentiate into plasma cells; others are set aside and become memory B cells. The first wave of antibodies they produce is always IgM. Class switching to other isotypes and somatic hypermutation (necessary for the generation and selection of high-affinity antibodies) require the persistence of antigen or repeated exposure to antigen. In addition to cytokines, B cells require cell-cell contacts to initiate these processes. These contacts involve CD40 protein on B cells and CD40L on T cells. These proteins are members of the TNF-TNF receptor family. Recent work on HIV suggests that extensive hypermutation is a prerequisite for the generation of broadly neutralizing antibodies (antibodies that can neutralize a broad selection of highly variable HIV isolates). More insight in the control of somatic hypermutation will be required to understand the nature of the antigen(s) capable of eliciting such desirable antibodies as a prophylactic strategy.

Step 12 Activated T cells engage antigen-experienced B cells through peptide-MHC complexes displayed on the surface of the B cell. Step 13 T cells that are
persistently activated initiate expression of the CD40 ligand (CD40L), a prerequisite for B cells becoming fully activated and turning on the enzymatic machinery (AID) to initiate class-switch recombination and somatic hypermutation. Step 14 A B cell that receives the appropriate instructions from CD4 helper T cells becomes an IgM-secreting plasma cell. Step 15 A B cell that receives signals from activated CD4 helper T cells in the form of CD40-CD40L interactions and the appropriate cytokines can switch to other immunoglobulin isotypes and engage in somatic hypermutation.

## Vaccines Elicit Protective Immunity Against a Variety of Pathogens

$\mathbb{R}$Arguably the most important practical application of immunological principles is vaccines. Vaccines are materials that are designed to be innocuous but that can elicit an immune response for the purpose of providing protection against a challenge with the virulent version of a pathogen (Figure 23-38). It is not always known why vaccines are as successful as they are, but in many cases, the ability to raise antibodies that can neutralize a pathogen (viruses) or that show microbicidal effects (bacteria) are good indicators of successful vaccination.

Several strategies can lead to a successful vaccine. Serial passage of a pathogen in tissue culture or from animal to animal often leads to attenuation, the molecular basis for which is not well understood. Vaccines may be composed of live attenuated variants of more virulent pathogens. The attenuated version of the pathogen causes a mild form of the disease or causes no symptoms at all. However, by recruiting all the component parts of the adaptive immune system,
![li22035345559](li22035345559.jpg)

FIGURE 23-38 Time course of a viral infection. The initial antiviral response, seen when the number of infectious particles rises, includes activation of natural killer (NK) cells and production of type I interferons. These responses are part of the innate immune response. The production of antibodies and the activation of cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) follow, eventually clearing the infection. Re-exposure to the same virus leads to more rapid and more pronounced production of antibodies and to more rapid activation of cytotoxic T cells. A successful vaccine induces an immune response similar in some respects to that following initial exposure to a pathogen, but without causing significant symptoms of disease. If a vaccinated person is subsequently exposed to the same pathogen, the adaptive immune system is primed to respond quickly and strongly.
such live attenuated vaccines can elicit protective levels of antibodies. These antibody levels may wane with advancing age because the lymphocytes responsible for immunological memory may have a finite life span, so repeated immunizations (booster injections) are often required to maintain full protection. Live attenuated vaccines are in use against flu, measles, mumps, and tuberculosis. In the latter case, an attenuated strain of the mycobacterium that causes the disease is used (Bacille Calmette-Guerin; BCG). Although live attenuated poliovirus was used as a vaccine until recently, its use was discontinued because the risk of reemergence, by mutation, of more virulent strains of the poliovirus outweighed the benefit. Currently, killed poliovirus is used as the vaccine of choice in the United States and Europe, although live attenuated poliovirus vaccines continue to be used elsewhere.

Vaccines based on the cowpox virus, a close relative of the human variola virus that causes smallpox, have been used successfully to eradicate smallpox, the first such example of the elimination of an infectious disease. Attempts to achieve a similar feat for polio are nearing completion, but socioeconomic and political factors or armed conflict often complicate the administration of vaccines, leading to reemergence of the disease, as seen recently in Asia.

The other major type of vaccine is called a subunit vaccine. Rather than live attenuated strains of a virulent bacterium or virus, only one or several of its components (a subunit of the entire pathogen) are used to elicit immunity. In certain cases, this approach is sufficient to afford lasting protection against a challenge with the live, virulent source of the antigen used for vaccination. It has been successful in preventing infections with the hepatitis B virus. The commonly used flu vaccines are composed mainly of the envelope proteins neuraminidase and hemagglutinin (see Figure 3-11); these vaccines elicit neutralizing antibodies. For the vaccine against human papillomavirus HPV 16, a serotype that causes cervical cancer, viruslike particles composed of the virus's capsid structural proteins but devoid of its genetic material are generated; these particles are noninfectious, yet in many respects mimic the intact virion. The HPV vaccine now licensed for use in humans is expected to reduce the incidence of cervical cancer in susceptible populations by perhaps as much as 80 percent, the first example of a vaccine that prevents a particular type of cancer.

From a public health perspective, cheaply produced and widely distributed vaccines are formidable tools for preventing or even eradicating communicable diseases. Current efforts are aimed at producing vaccines against diseases for which no other suitable therapies are available (Ebola virus) or where socioeconomic conditions have made the distribution of drugs problematic (malaria, HIV). With a more complete understanding of how the immune system operates, it should be possible to improve on the design of existing vaccines and extend these principles to diseases for which no successful vaccines are currently available. A remaining challenge is the massive genetic variation that

pathogens can acquire: the error-prone reverse transcriptase of HIV introduces mutations with every successive cycle of viral replication, creating untold numbers of variants. Viable variants that carry such mutations may escape detection by the immune system. The design of effective vaccines must therefore be focused on those structural elements that do not tolerate mutations and that can be "seen" by the adaptive immune system.

## The Immune System Defends Against Cancer

The immune system not only defends against the immediate consequences of infection with pathogens, but may also help in warding off cancer. As we have seen, the adaptive immune system is purged of many self-reactive B and T cells by negative selection. Self-reactive lymphocytes that escape this process are usually silenced because they are not provided with the appropriate (co)stimulatory signals. Conditions that lead to severe immunosuppression, such as a genetic lesion in the RAG somatic recombination machinery or immunodeficiency caused by infection with HIV, confer an increased risk of cancer, not only for cancers caused by transforming viruses but also for those elicited by carcinogens. This observation establishes a role for the immune response in keeping precancerous cells in check.

Recall that B and T cells require activation not only via their antigen-specific receptors, but also by a second, co-stimulatory signal (e.g., engagement of CD28 on T cells). Withholding of this co-stimulatory signal silences, or anergizes, any self-reactive lymphocyte that escaped deletion in the course of T-cell selection. Because tumor cells are exceedingly similar to the progenitors that give rise to them (see Chapter 24), with only those few mutations ("driver mutations") required to cause cancer, it is not immediately obvious how immune recognition aids in the eradication of (pre) malignanT cells before they have chance to grow into larger tumors. Nonetheless, somatic mutations-even those that are adventitious and do not directly contribute to causing cancer-can create so-called neo-antigens in the developing tumor cell that may be recognized by antigen-specific receptors. Chemical mutagens, as experienced by heavy smokers who expose their lungs to tobacco products, not only cause mutations in genes that then drive tumorigenesis, but also cause mutations in other genes (passenger mutations), providing a rich spectrum of altered gene products to which the developing immune system was never exposed. If there is no immune tolerance for these mutagen-induced neo-antigens, they may serve as targets for recognition by the host's immune system.

Often the deregulation of gene expression that accompanies a transformed phenotype results in re-expression of differentiation antigens characteristic of a much earlier developmental state. If these differentiation antigens were expressed at a stage of development when the immune system had not yet fully matured, immune tolerance for such differentiation antigens may not have been established. These antigens may therefore be targets for immune recognition.

Finally, the levels of certain gene products may no longer be properly regulated in cancer cells and may begin to exceed a threshold required for immune recognition, notwithstanding the fact that they are proteins normally made by the host, albeit at much reduced levels.

In summary, because cancer can be considered a disease caused first and foremost by mutations, whose effects are modified by epigenetic events (see Chapter 24), there is the potential for immune recognition of cancer cells. Furthermore, in much the same way that an immune response against a virus or a bacterium can result in the outgrowth of variants that are no longer recognized by the immune system, selective pressure exerted by the immune system may also lead to variants of cancer cells that have lost expression of a possible tumor antigen. For example, many colon cancers show reduced levels, if not complete loss of expression, of class I MHC products, and are thus rendered invisible to cytotoxic T cells.

The tumor microenvironment is composed of stromal cells: fibroblasts and myeloid-derived cells, including macrophages. Lymphocytes are known to invade tumors, as do neutrophils. The interplay between tumor cells and the microenvironment in which these cells reside can create immunosuppressive conditions that preclude a successful anti-tumor immune response, even if the tumor cells themselves are sufficiently antigenically distinct to be recognized as such. Important players in establishing an immunosuppressive environment are molecules now referred to as immunological checkpoints, such as CTLA4, the expression of which increases as T cells undergo full activation and maturation. Normally, CTLA4 would play a role in terminating an immune response, but its expression on tumor-specific T cells would compromise their anti-tumor activity. Moreover, the thymus and peripheral lymphoid compartments produce Treg cells, which are capable of suppressing the activity of other T cells. An abundance of Treg cells would keep other T cells from attacking a tumor. By the same logic, these Treg cells may keep potentially self-reactive T cells in check as a means of preventing the onset or reducing the severity of autoimmune disease.

Two key inhibitors of immune responses are PD-1 on T cells and PD-L1 on T-cell targets. This pair of proteins inhibits T-cell function. A spectacular breakthrough in the treatment of cancer is the use of antibodies that target the inhibitory CTLA4 and PD-1 proteins. Some 30-50 percent of patients with metastatic melanoma, refractory to other forms of therapy, respond to treatment with these antibodies, which has resulted in complete remissions and even cures. Similar approaches are under way to treat different forms of lung and renal cancer. Treatment with anti-CTLA4 apparently broadens the repertoire of cytotoxic T cells capable of recognizing tumor antigens as well as suppressing the activity of Treg cells. Treatment with anti-PD-1 enhances IT-cell recognition of tumors. It is perhaps ironic that smokers with the heaviest exposure to tobacco products may benefit the most from these forms of treatment because of the high mutational load in their cancers.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 23.6

## Collaboration of Immune-System Cells in the Adaptive Response

- Antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells require activation by means of signals delivered to their Toll-like receptors. These receptors are broadly specific for macromolecules produced by bacteria and viruses. Engagement of TLRs activates the NF-кB signaling pathway, whose outputs include the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines (see Figure 23-35).
- Upon activation, dendritic cells become migratory and move to lymph nodes, ready for their encounter with T cells. Activation of dendritic cells also increases their display of MHC-peptide complexes and expression of co-stimulatory molecules required for initiation of a T-cell response.
- B cells require the assistance of T cells to execute their full differentiation program to become plasma cells. Antigenspecific help is provided to B cells by activated T cells, which recognize class II MHC-peptide complexes on the surfaces of B cells. These B cells generate the relevant MHC-peptide complexes by internalizing antigen via BCR-mediated endocytosis, followed by antigen processing and presentation via the class II MHC pathway (see Figure 23-37).
- In addition to cytokines produced by activated T cells, B cells require cell-cell contact to initiate somatic hypermutation and class-switch recombination. This contact involves CD40 on B cells and CD40L on T cells.
- Important applications of the immunological concept of collaboration between T and B cells include vaccines. The most common forms of vaccines are live attenuated viruses or bacteria, which can evoke a protective immune response without causing pathology, and subunit vaccines.
- The adaptive immune system can sometimes distinguish between normal cells and their cancerous counterparts. What complicates immune-system detection of cancer cells are the often relatively minor differences between normal and transformed cells.
- Immunological checkpoints dampen the activity of antigenspecific T cells, under normal circumstances as a means of turning off or controlling an immune response.

This nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor arising from the mucosal epithelium of the nasopharynx, the uppermost part of the throat. NPCs can arise due to cigarette smoking or eating nitrosamine-rich foods (such as salt-cured fish) or result from an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. The section showing the NPC is stained with hematoxylin and eosin. [Biophoto Associates/Science Source.]

Cancer causes about one-fifth of the deaths in the United States each year. Worldwide, between 100 and 350 of every 100,000 people die of cancer each year. Cancer results from failures of the mechanisms that usually control the growth and proliferation of cells. During normal development and throughout adult life, intricate genetic control systems regulate the balance between cell birth and cell death in response to growth signals, growth-inhibiting signals, and death signals. Cell birth and death rates determine the rate of growth and adult body size. In some adult tissues, cell proliferation occurs continuously as a constant tissue-renewal strategy. Intestinal epithelial cells, for instance, live for just a few days before they die and are replaced; certain white blood cells are replaced just as rapidly, and skin cells commonly survive for only 2-4 weeks before being shed. The cells in many adult tissues, however, normally do not proliferate except during healing processes. Such stable cells (e.g., hepatocytes, heart muscle cells, neurons) can remain functional for long

periods or even for the entire lifetime of an organism. Cancer occurs when the mechanisms that maintain normal proliferation rates malfunction to cause excess cell division.

The losses of cellular regulation that give rise to most or all cases of cancer result from genetic damage that is often caused by tumor-promoting chemicals, hormones, and sometimes viruses. Mutations in three broad classes of genes have been implicated in the onset of cancer. Protooncogenes normally promote cell growth; mutations change them into oncogenes whose products are excessively active in growth promotion. Oncogenic mutations usually result in either increased gene expression or production of a hyperactive gene product. Tumor-suppressor genes normally restrain growth, so mutations that inactivate them allow inappropriate cell division. A third class of genes often linked to cancer, called genome maintenance genes, are involved in maintaining the genome's integrity. When these genes are inactivated, cells acquire additional genetic changes at an

### 24.5 Deregulation of the Cell Cycle and Genome Maintenance Pathways in Cancer

increased rate-including mutations that cause the deregulation of cell growth and proliferation and lead to cancer. Many of the genes in these three classes encode proteins that help regulate cell proliferation (i.e., entry into and progression through the cell cycle) or cell death by apoptosis; others encode proteins that participate in repairing damaged DNA.

The cancer-forming process, called oncogenesis or tumorigenesis, is an interplay between genetics and the environment. Most cancers arise after genes are altered by cancer-causing chemicals, known as carcinogens, or by errors in their copying and repair. Even if the genetic damage occurs in only one somatic cell, division of this cell will transmit the damage to its daughter cells, giving rise to a clone of altered cells. Rarely, however, does mutation in a single gene lead to the onset of cancer. More typically, a series of mutations in multiple genes creates a progressively more rapidly proliferating cell type that escapes normal growth restraints, creating an opportunity for additional mutations. The cells also acquire other properties that give them an advantage, such as the ability to escape from normal epithelia and to stimulate the growth of vasculature to obtain oxygen. Eventually the clone of cells grows into a tumor. In some cases, cells from the primary tumor migrate to new sites, where they form secondary tumors, a process termed metastasis. Most cancer deaths are due to invasive, fast-growing metastasized tumors.

Time plays an important role in cancer. It may take many years for a cell to accumulate the multiple mutations that are required to form a tumor, so most cancers develop later in life. The requirement for multiple mutations also lowers the frequency of cancer compared with what it would be if tumorigenesis were triggered by a single mutation. However, huge numbers of cells are, in essence, mutagenized and tested for altered growth during our lifetimes, a powerful selection in favor of these mutagenized cells, which, in this case, we do not want. Cells that proliferate quickly become more abundant, undergo further genetic changes, and can become progressively more dangerous. Furthermore, cancer occurs most frequently after the age of reproduction and therefore plays little role in reproductive success. So cancer is common, in part reflecting an increasingly longer human life span, but also reflecting the lack of selective pressure against the disease.

Clinically, cancers are often classified by their embryonic tissue of origin. Malignant tumors are classified as carcinomas if they derive from epithelia such as endoderm (gut epithelium) or ectoderm (skin and neural epithelia) and sarcomas if they derive from mesoderm (muscle, blood, and connective tissue precursors). Carcinomas are by far the most common type of malignant tumor (more than 90 percent). Most tumors are solid masses, but the leukemias, a class of sarcomas, grow as individual cells in the blood. (The name leukemia is derived from the Latin for "white blood": the massive proliferation of leukemic cells can cause a patient's blood to appear milky.)

In this chapter, we first introduce the properties of tumor cells, illustrating how every aspect of cellular homeostasis
and the interaction of cells with their environment is altered in cancer. We then discuss the origins of cancer and describe the evolutionary process that leads to the formation of malignant, often metastatic, cancers. Next we consider the general types of genetic changes that lead to the unique characteristics of cancer cells and the interplay between somatic and inherited mutations. The following section examines in detail how mutations affecting both growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting processes can result in excess cell proliferation. We conclude the chapter with a discussion of the role of cell cycle deregulation in cancer and of how the breakdown of genome maintenance functions contributes to tumorigenesis.

### 24.1 How Tumor Cells Differ from Normal Cells

Before examining the genetic basis of cancer in detail, let's consider the general properties of tumor cells that distinguish them from normal cells. The change from a normal cell to a cancer cell commonly involves multiple steps, each one adding properties that make cells more likely to grow into a tumor. The genetic changes that underlie oncogenesis alter several fundamental properties of cells, allowing those cells to evade normal growth controls and ultimately conferring the full cancer phenotype (Figure 24-1). Cancer cells acquire a drive to proliferate that does not require an external

FIGURE 24-1 Overview of changes in cells that cause cancer.
During carcinogenesis, six fundamental cellular properties are altered, as shown here in this tumor growing within normal tissue, to give rise to the complete, most destructive cancer phenotype. Less dangerous tumors arise when only some of these changes occur. In this chapter, we examine the genetic changes that result in these altered cellular properties. See D. Hanahan and R. A. Weinberg, 2011, Cell 144:646-674.

inducing signal. They fail to sense signals that restrict cell division, and they continue to live when they should die. They often change their attachment to surrounding cells or to the extracellular matrix, breaking loose to move away from their tissue of origin. Tumors are characteristically hypoxic (oxygen starved), so to grow to more than a small size, tumors must obtain a blood supply. They often do so by inducing the growth of blood vessels into the tumor. As cancer progresses, a tumor becomes an abnormal organ, increasingly well adapted to growth and invasion of surrounding tissues, and often spreading to distant sites in the body.

In this section, we describe the characteristics of cancer cells. We first discuss the changes in the cancer cell's genetic makeup that affect virtually all cellular functions, allowing the cancer cell to escape proliferation regulation and acquire the ability to divide indefinitely. We then see how the genetic changes in a tumor cell and its interactions with its environment facilitate its escape from the constraints of the tissue it was once a part of and allow it to invade neighboring tissues and colonize distant sites in the body.

## The Genetic Makeup of Most Cancer Cells Is Dramatically Altered

At the turn of the twentieth century, David von Hansemann and Theodor Boveri first documented what we now know to be an almost universal feature of cancer cells: their entire genetic makeup differs dramatically from that of normal cells. Tumors harbor all types of genetic alterations-point mutations, small and large amplifications and deletions, translocations, and aberrant numbers of chromosomes-generally too many, a condition known as aneuploidy (Figure 24-2). The recent sequencing of many human tumors has provided insights into the frequency with which these genetic changes occur in specific cancers and has identified new types of mutational mechanisms. Typical cancer cells exhibit whole chromosome or chromosome arm gains and losses involving a quarter of their genome. Local amplifications and deletions affect about 10 percent of the cancer cell's genome. Perhaps the most surprising result revealed by the sequencing of cancers is the high degree of variation in mutation rates across different cancers. Mutations are rare in pediatric cancers, with substitution rates as low as 0.1 base changes per megabase, but those rates may be as high as 100 base changes per megabase in mutagen-induced cancers such as lung cancer and melanoma.

DNA replication and chromosome segregation errors can lead to aneuploidy and to gains and losses of chromosome arms. Decreased replication fidelity and mutagens also profoundly affect the cancer genome. In addition to these well-established genome instability-inducing mechanisms, cancer genome sequencing has identified other novel, unusual mechanisms that lead to the dramatic genomic changes observed in human cancers. Hypermutation characterized by multiple base-pair substitutions near translocation break points has been discovered. The mechanism underlying this dramatic local genome alteration, termed kataegis (from the

Greek for "thunderstorm"), is not known, but probably involves an enzyme, known as activation-induced deaminase (AID), that plays a key role in antibody diversity generation, which is discussed in Chapter 23. Another highly unusual mutational mechanism that occurs in 2-3 percent of human cancers, but with a prevalence of up to 18 percent in aggressive neuroblastomas (a type of nerve cell tumor), is called chromothripsis. Here entire chromosomes or large parts thereof are shattered (thripsis in Greek means "shattering") and stitched together again in what appears to be a random manner, leading to dozens or sometimes even hundreds of rearrangements. This shattering and stitching together of individual chromosomes appears to occur when chromosomes or parts thereof are not incorporated into the nucleus, but rather form their own micronuclei. There replication occurs less efficiently, leading to chromosome breakage and stitching together of chromosome pieces in a random manner by nonhomologous end joining, a form of DNA repair in which DNA pieces are fused together via their ends. As we will see in the following sections, the genetic changes that occur in cancer cells affect virtually all aspects of cellular homeostasis, proliferation, tissue organization, and migratory properties as well as survival and proliferation at foreign sites in the body.

## Cellular Housekeeping Functions Are Fundamentally Altered in Cancer Cells

Cancer cells can often be distinguished from normal cells by microscopic examination. They are usually less well differentiated than normal cells. Cancer cells frequently exhibit the characteristics of rapidly growing cells: a high nucleus-tocytoplasm ratio, prominent nucleoli, an increased frequency of mitotic cells, and relatively little specialized structure.

Tumor cells differ from normal cells not only in their appearance, but in their entire protein composition. Genomewide gene expression and protein composition analyses have shown that in all organisms studied to date, increases in gene copy number lead to corresponding increases in gene expression. (Notable exceptions to this observation are the genes located on sex chromosomes.) Thus the genomic changes so characteristic of cancer cells-losses and gains of whole chromosomes or chromosome parts-have a profound effect on the protein composition of the cell and hence on most, if not all, cellular functions. This, in turn, causes a stress response that is aimed at offsetting the protein imbalances that cancer cells experience. For example, cancer cells rely heavily on protein folding and degradation mechanisms for their survival as a direct result of their dramatically altered chromosome composition. This dependence of cancer cells on proteome maintenance pathways for their survival makes the constituents of these pathways attractive drug targets.

Another prominent feature of cancer cells is their use of an unusual energy-generating mechanism. Normal differentiated cells rely on mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation to satisfy their energy needs. Cells metabolize glucose to carbon dioxide by oxidation of pyruvate through the tricarboxylic

Image of chromosomes obtained (a) from a normal human cell, with its characteristic 23 pairs of chromosomes, and (b) from an SW403 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line. Each individual pair of chromosomes has a distinctive color. Two characteristics of the cancer cells are evident. First, the number of individual chromosomes is altered compared with
acid (TCA) cycle in the mitochondria (see Chapter 12). Only under anaerobic conditions do normal cells undergo anaerobic glycolysis and produce large amounts of lactate. Most cancer cells, however, rely on glycolysis for energy production irrespective of whether oxygen levels are high or low (Figure 24-3). The use of glycolysis to produce energy even

normal cells. Second, many chromosomes are composites of pieces from different chromosomes. [Part (a) @Prof. Philippe Vago @ISM/Phototake. Part (b) From Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2001 98(5):2538-43, Fig. 3c. Spectral karyotyping suggests additional subsets of colorectal cancers characterized by pattern of chromosome rearrangement. By Abdel-Rahman et al.

in the presence of oxygen, called aerobic glycolysis, was first discovered in cancer cells by the biochemist Otto Warburg and is therefore called the Warburg effect. The metabolism of glucose to lactate generates only 2 ATP molecules per molecule of glucose, while oxidative phosphorylation generates up to 36 molecules of ATP per molecule of glucose.

FIGURE 24-3 Energy production in cancer cells by aerobic glycolysis. In the presence of oxygen, nonproliferating (differentiated) cells metabolize glucose into pyruvate via glycolysis. Pyruvate is then transported into mitochondria, where it is fed into the TCA cycle. Oxygen is required as the final electron acceptor during oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, when oxygen is limiting, cells metabolize pyruvate into lactate, allowing glycolysis to continue by cycling NADH back to $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. Cancer cells and proliferating cells convert most glucose to lactate regardless of whether oxygen is present or not. The production of lactate in the presence of oxygen is called aerobic glycolysis. See M. G. Vander Heiden et al., 2009, Science 324:1029.

Cells can, however, use glycolysis intermediates to synthesize macromolecules and lipids. The rewiring of glucose metabolism could thus provide the fuel necessary to sustain macromolecule biosynthesis and proliferation of cancer cells.

Not only do cancer cells rewire their metabolic pathways, but some cancer types produce novel metabolites that play a critical role in the disease. Seventy percent of glioblastomas, oligodendrogliomas, and astrocytomas (all brain cancers) and approximately 25 percent of acute myeloid leukemias harbor mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), a TCA cycle enzyme that converts isocitrate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate (Figure 24-4). The IDH mutations found in these cancers cause the enzyme to convert isocitrate into a new metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which accumulates to levels of up to $5-35 \mathrm{mM}$ in cancer cells! So how does 2-hydroxyglutarate promote tumorigenesis? It inhibits several enzymes that require $\alpha$-ketoglutarate for their function, including proteins that regulate the methylation state of histones. In this way, 2-hydroxyglutarate alters gene expression. Whether 2-hydroxyglutarate is the only example of a cancer-specific metabolite or whether it is but the first in a new class of oncometabolites remains to be seen.

## Uncontrolled Proliferation Is a Universal Trait of Cancer

In normal tissues, cell proliferation is a tightly controlled process. Growth-promoting factors are released in a highly controlled fashion to ensure that cells proliferate only to replenish a tissue. Cancer cells have evolved mechanisms to escape these tight controls. As will be discussed in detail in Section 24.4, cancer cells up-regulate growth-promoting pathways while simultaneously down-regulating growthinhibiting and cell death pathways. In this manner, cancer cells gain the ability to proliferate continuously. This ability leads to the expansion of the cancer cell population. As we will see, selective targeting of the mutations that cause uncontrolled proliferation is a highly successful approach in treating certain types of cancers.

Increases in proliferation-promoting signals and decreases in proliferation-inhibiting signals are not the only changes that endow cancer cells with the ability to proliferate indefinitely. Chromosome ends need to be protected throughout cancer cell proliferation. Telomeres, the physical

FIGURE 24-4 2-Hydroxyglutarate is a cancer-specific metabolite. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) is an enzyme in the TCA cycle. It converts isocitrate into $\alpha$-ketoglutarate, which is then further converted into succinyl CoA. Some mutant forms of IDH found in many brain cancers create a novel metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), from $\alpha$-ketoglutarate. 2-Hydroxyglutarate accumulates to extremely high levels in these cells and inhibits the activity of proteins that require $\alpha$-ketoglutarate for their function. Many of the enzymes that are inhibited control gene expression, such as the TET family of DNA hydroxylases, or the methylation state of histones, such as histone methyl transferases and demethylases.

ends of linear chromosomes (discussed in Chapter 8), consist of tandem arrays of a short DNA sequence, TTAGGG in vertebrates. Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that contains an RNA template, repeatedly adds TTAGGG repeats to chromosome ends to lengthen or maintain the $3-20-\mathrm{kb}$ regions of repeats that decorate the ends of human chromosomes. Embryonic cells, germ-line cells, and stem cells produce telomerase, but most human somatic cells produce only a small amount of telomerase as they enter S phase. As a result of their modest telomerase activity, their telomeres shorten with each cell cycle. Extensive shortening of telomeres is recognized by the cell as a double-strand break and consequently triggers cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Tumor cells overcome this fate by producing telomerase. Many researchers believe that telomerase expression is essential for a tumor cell to become immortal. Indeed, the introduction of telomerase-producing transgenes into cultured human cells that otherwise lack the enzyme can extend their life span by more than 20 doublings while maintaining telomere length. The reliance of many cancers on increased telomerase activity has led some researchers to propose that inhibitors of telomerase could be highly effective cancer therapeutic agents.

## Cancer Cells Escape the Confines of Tissues

Normal cells stop growing when they contact other cells, eventually forming a layer of well-ordered cells (Figure 24-5a). Cancer cells are less adherent, forming a three-dimensional cluster of cells (a focus) that can be recognized under a microscope (Figure 24-5b). This loss of confinement to tissue structures can be modeled in vitro. Cultured mouse fibroblasts called 3T3 cells normally stop growing when they contact other cells, eventually forming a monolayer of well-ordered

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 24-5 Scanning electron micrographs reveal the organizational and morphological differences between normal and transformed 3T3 cells. (a) Cultured mouse fibroblasts called 3T3 cells are normally elongated and are aligned and closely packed in an orderly fashion. (b) 3T3 cells transformed by an oncogene encoded by Rous sarcoma virus are rounded and covered
cells that have stopped proliferating and are in the quiescent $\mathrm{G}_{0}$ phase of the cell cycle (see Figure 24-5a). When DNA from human bladder cancer cells is transfected into cultured 3T3 cells, about one cell in a million incorporates a particular segment of the exogenous DNA that causes a phenotypic change (see Classic Experiment 24-1). The progeny of the affected cell are more rounded and less adherent to one another and to the culture dish than are the normal surrounding cells (see Figure 24-5b). Cells that do not cease division when they contact other cells are said to be no longer "contact inhibited" and to have undergone oncogenic transformation. Recent work has implicated adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin, cell polarity factors, actin cytoskeleton regulators, and the Hippo pathway in mediating cell cycle arrest when cell-cell contacts are established. However, the exact mechanisms whereby this occurs, and how these pathways are disrupted in cancer, remain to be worked out.

## Tumors Are Heterogeneous Organs That Are Sculpted by Their Environment

Not all tumors are made up of uniform cells, even if they originated from a single initiating cell. In some types of tumors, for example, only certain tumor cells, called cancer stem cells, are capable of seeding a new tumor. Within these tumors, some cells cease dividing, while others can continue cancerous growth. The latter, of course, are the most dangerous and the most important to destroy with anticancer treatments. Cancer stem cells are thought to give rise to some cells with high replicative capabilities and others with more limited replicative potential. The origins of these cancer stem cells are not clear. In some cancers, a normal tissue stem cell may give rise to the cancer stem cells. In others, dedifferentiation of terminally differentiated cells to form progenitor

with small hairlike processes and bulbous projections. The transformed cells have lost the side-by-side organization of the normal cells and grow one atop the other. These transformed cells have many of the same properties as malignant cells. Similar changes are seen in cells transfected with DNA from human cancers containing the ras ${ }^{D}$ oncogene. (Lan Bo Chen.)

cells may give rise to cancer stem cells. Irrespective of their origin, cancer stem cells share gene expression signatures with normal tissue stem cells, leading to their designation as stem cell-like cells.

The immediate environment of a tumor-the tumor microenvironment-contributes to the heterogeneity of cells within the tumor, influencing the behavior of the cancer stem cells and the tumor cells in general. Some neighboring cells may be more conducive to tumor growth than others. The importance of the tumor microenvironment extends to one of the most common environmental influences on a tumor cell: inflammatory cells. It is now widely accepted that cells of the immune system interact with the tumor. $\mathrm{CD} 8^{+}$cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells surround and often migrate into the tumor, where they are thought to inhibit tumor formation. Mice deficient in these and other components of the immune system are more prone to carcinogen-induced tumors than normal mice. These findings lead to the idea that the immune system eliminates cancer cells. How cancer cells escape this immune surveillance is a critical question that remains to be addressed.

More and more evidence is mounting that immune-system cells can also have tumorigenic properties. It has been known for a long time that cancers frequently arise at sites of injury or chronic infection. It is estimated that up to 20 percent of cancers are linked to chronic infection. For example, persistent Helicobacter pylori infection is associated with gastric cancer. Crohn's disease, an autoimmune disease that affects the intestines, is associated with colon cancer. Infection with hepatitis B or C viruses increases the risk of a form of liver cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma. Immune-system cells migrate to sites of injury or infection and produce growth factors, thereby stimulating tumor cell proliferation. They also produce factors to induce the growth of blood vessels, which-as we will discuss next-is an essential aspect of tumor growth and dissemination to distant sites.

## Tumor Growth Requires Formation of New Blood Vessels

Tumors must recruit new blood vessels in order to grow to a large size. In the absence of a blood supply, a tumor can grow into a mass of about $10^{6}$ cells, roughly a sphere 2 mm in diameter. At this point, division of cells on the outside of the tumor mass is balanced by death of cells in the center from an inadequate supply of nutrients. Such tumors, unless they secrete hormones, cause few problems. However, most tumors induce the formation of new blood vessels that invade the tumor and nourish it, a process called angiogenesis. This complex process requires several discrete steps: degradation of the basement membrane that surrounds a nearby capillary, migration of endothelial cells lining the capillary into the tumor, division of these endothelial cells, and formation of a new basement membrane around the newly elongated capillary.

Many tumors produce growth factors that stimulate angiogenesis; other tumors somehow induce surrounding normal cells to synthesize and secrete such factors. Basic fibroblast growth factor ( $\beta$-FGF), transforming growth factor
$\alpha$ (TGF- $\alpha$ ), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are secreted by many tumors, all have angiogenic properties. New blood vessels allow the tumor to increase in size and thus increase the probability that additional harmful mutations will occur. The presence of an adjacent blood vessel also facilitates the process of metastasis.

The VEGF receptors, which are tyrosine kinases, regulate several aspects of blood vessel growth, such as endothelial cell survival and growth, endothelial cell migration, and vessel wall permeability. VEGF expression can be induced by oncogenes and by hypoxia, defined as a partial pressure of oxygen of less than 7 mmHg . The hypoxia signal is mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), a transcription factor that is activated in low-oxygen conditions and which binds to and induces transcription of the VEGF gene and about 30 other genes, many of which can affect the probability of tumor growth. HIF-1 activity is controlled by an oxygen sensor composed of a prolyl hydroxylase that is active at normal $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ levels but inactive when deprived of $\mathrm{O}_{2}$. Hydroxylation of HIF-1 causes ubiquitinylation and degradation of the transcription factor, a process that is blocked when $\mathrm{O}_{2}$ is low. Compounds that inhibit angiogenesis have excited much interest as potential therapeutic agents, but their success in the clinic has thus far been limited.

## Invasion and Metastasis Are Late Stages of Tumorigenesis

Tumors arise with great frequency, especially in older individuals, but most pose little risk to their host because they are small and localized. We call such tumors benign; an example is a wart, a benign skin tumor. The cells composing benign tumors closely resemble, and may function like, normal cells. The cell-adhesion molecules that hold tissues together keep benign tumor cells, like normal cells, localized to the tissues where they originate. A fibrous capsule usually delineates the extent of a benign tumor and makes it an easy target for a surgeon. Benign tumors become serious medical problems only if their sheer bulk interferes with normal functions or if they secrete excess amounts of biologically active substances such as hormones. For example, acromegaly, the overgrowth of head, hands, and feet, can occur when a benign pituitary tumor causes overproduction of growth hormone.

In contrast to benign tumor cells, malignant tumor cells are able to invade nearby tissue, spreading and seeding additional tumors while the cells continue to proliferate (Figure 24-6). This ability is a major characteristic that differentiates malignant tumors from benign ones. Some malignant tumors, such as those in the ovary or breast, remain localized and encapsulated, at least for a time. When these tumors progress, however, the cells invade surrounding tissues and undergo metastasis (Figure 24-7a).

Normal cells are restricted to their place in an organ or tissue by cell-cell adhesion and by physical barriers such as the basement membrane, which underlies layers of epithelial cells and also surrounds the endothelial cells of blood vessels (see Chapter 20). In contrast, cancer cells have acquired the

ability to penetrate basement membranes using a cell protrusion called an invadopodium and to migrate to distant sites in the body (Figure 24-7b). A developmental process known as the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is thought to play a crucial role during the process of metastasis in some cancers. During normal development, the conversion of epithelial cells into mesenchymal cells is a step in the formation of some organs and tissues. An EMT requires distinct changes in patterns of gene expression and results in fundamental changes in cell morphology, such as loss of cell-cell adhesion, loss of cell polarity, and the acquisition of migratory and invasive properties. During metastasis, the EMT regulatory pathways are thought to be activated at the invasive front of a tumor, producing single migratory cells. At the heart of the EMT are two transcription factors, Snail and Twist. These transcription factors promote expression of genes involved in cell migration, trigger down-regulation of cell-adhesion factors such as E-cadherin, and increase the production of proteases that digest the basement membrane, thus allowing its penetration by the tumor cells. For example, many tumor cells secrete a protein (plasminogen activator) that converts the serum protein plasminogen to the active protease plasmin. Importantly, expression of many important drivers of the EMT, such as SNAIL1 and SNAIL2, has been shown to correlate with disease relapse and decreased patient survival in many cancers, including breast, colon, and ovarian cancer. The occurrence of the EMT predicts a poor clinical outcome.

As the basement membrane disintegrates, some tumor cells enter the bloodstream, but fewer than 1 in 10,000 cells that escape the primary tumor survive to colonize another tissue and form a secondary, metastatic tumor. Much of preventative medicine is currently focused on developing methods to identify the rare tumor cells that circulate in the bloodstream. The ability to capture these circulating tumor cells would not only provide a powerful and noninvasive tool for the early detection of cancer, but their analysis could provide insights into the nature of the disease and inform treatment.

In order to produce metastases, tumor cells must not only enter the bloodstream, but adhere to the lining of the blood vessel in a new location and migrate through it into

FIGURE 24-7 Metastasis. (a) First steps in metastasis, using breast carcinoma cells as an example. Cancer cells leave the main tumor and attack the basement membrane, using extracellular matrix (ECM) fibers to reach the blood vessels. The cancer cells can be attracted by signals such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), which can be secreted by macrophages. At the blood vessels they penetrate the layer of endothelial cells that forms the vessel walls and enter the bloodstream. (b) Carcinoma cells penetrate the extracellular matrix and blood vessel wall by extending "invadopodia," which produce matrix metalloproteases and other proteases to open up a path. [Adapted from H.

the underlying tissue in a process called extravasation (see Chapter 20). In order to seed a metastasis at a distant site, the tumor cells must not only disseminate, but also adapt to a foreign tissue environment. At least initially, metastatic tumor cells may not be well adapted to their new environment, but they are thought to evolve to survive and thrive in a foreign context. Little is known about the molecular pathways that facilitate this adaptation, but mounting evidence suggests that some environments are more conductive to cancer cell colonization than others.

Because metastasis is the most common reason for morbidity associated with cancer, much effort is being put into understanding which tumors will become metastatic and how metastasis occurs. Traditionally, the properties of tumor and normal cells have been assessed using microscopic tools, and the prognosis for many tumors could be determined, within certain limits, from their histology. However, the appearance of cells alone has limited information content, and better ways to discern the properties of cells are desirable, both to understand tumorigenesis and to arrive at meaningful and accurate decisions about prognosis and therapy. The advent of methods to assess a tumor's patterns of RNA, protein, lipid, and metabolite production is allowing for a more detailed examination of tumor properties. Not surprisingly, primary tumors are often distinguishable from metastatic tumors by the RNAs and proteins that they produce. Analyses of global patterns of gene expression (described in Chapter 6) are now routinely used to predict patient outcomes and to determine the best course of treatment for many types of cancers, and they will soon become the standard in determining treatment options.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 24.1

## How Tumor Cells Differ From Normal Cells

- The genomes of most cancer cells undergo dramatic alterations, ranging from point mutations to deletions and amplifications to whole chromosome gains and losses. These changes in genetic makeup affect virtually all cellular functions.
- Uncontrolled proliferation and escape from the confines of the tissue of origin are two universal traits of cancer cells.
- Tumors are complex organs composed of different cell types that interact with their environment to obtain a maximal growth advantage.
- Both primary and secondary tumors require angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, in order to grow to a large mass.
- Cancer cells sometimes invade surrounding tissues, often breaking through the basement membranes that define the boundaries of tissues and spreading through the body to establish secondary areas of growth, a process called metastasis.
- Metastatic tumor cells acquire migratory properties in a process called the epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition.


### 24.2 The Origins and Development of Cancer

Tumors arise from single cells that acquire the ability to proliferate when their neighbors cannot. A series of evolutionary steps then follows by which cancer cells gain the means to escape the confines of the tissue they originate in, to survive in the circulatory systems of the body, and finally, to colonize distant sites. In this section, we examine the process of tumorigenesis. We first ask how carcinogens can induce tumorigenesis. We then introduce a hypothesis, known as the multi-hit model of cancer, that explains not only the multistep path of the disease, but also the fact that cancer is largely a disease of old age. We conclude this section by discussing cell-based and mouse models that have been instrumental in elucidating the molecular basis of tumorigenesis.

## Carcinogens Induce Cancer by Damaging DNA

The ability of chemical carcinogens to induce cancer results from the DNA damage they cause as well as the errors introduced into DNA during the cells' efforts to repair that damage. Thus carcinogens are also mutagens. The strongest evidence that carcinogens act through mutagenesis comes from the observation that cellular DNA altered by the exposure of cells to carcinogens can change cultured cells or cells implanted in mice into fast-growing cancer-like cells. The mutagenic effect of a carcinogen is roughly proportional to its ability to transform cells and induce cancer in animal models.

Although substances identified as chemical carcinogens have a broad range of chemical structures with no obvious unifying features, they can be classified into two general categories. Direct-acting carcinogens, of which there are only a few, are mainly reactive electrophiles (compounds that seek out and react with electron-rich centers in other compounds). By chemically reacting with nitrogen and oxygen atoms in DNA, these compounds can modify bases in DNA so as to distort the normal pattern of base pairing. If the modified nucleotides are not repaired, they allow an incorrect nucleotide to be incorporated during replication. This class of carcinogens includes ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS), dimethyl sulfate (DMS), and nitrogen mustards.

In contrast, indirect-acting carcinogens are generally unreactive, often water-insoluble compounds that can act as potent cancer inducers only after the introduction of electrophilic centers. In animals, cytochrome P-450 enzymes are located in the endoplasmic reticulum of most cells and at especially high levels in liver cells. P-450 enzymes normally function to add electrophilic centers, such as OH groups, to nonpolar foreign chemicals, such as certain insecticides and therapeutic drugs, in order to solubilize them so that they can be excreted from the body. However, P-450 enzymes can also turn otherwise harmless chemicals into carcinogens. Indeed, most chemical carcinogens have little mutagenic effect until they have been modified by cellular enzymes.

## Some Carcinogens Have Been Linked to Specific Cancers

In the earliest days of cancer awareness, it became clear that at least some cancers are due to environmental poisons. In 1775, for example, it was reported that the exposure of chimney sweeps to soot caused scrotal cancer, and in 1791, the use of snuff (tobacco) was reported to be associated with nasal cancer. Environmental chemicals were originally associated with cancer through experimental studies in animals. The classic experiment is to repeatedly paint a test substance on the back of a mouse and look for development of local or systemic tumors in the animal. Such assays led to the purification of a pure chemical carcinogen, benzo(a)pyrene, from coal tar in 1933.

The role of radiation in damaging chromosomes was first demonstrated in the 1920s using $\gamma$-irradiated Drosophila. Later the ability of radiation to cause human cancers, especially leukemia, was dramatically shown by the increased rates of leukemia among survivors of the atomic bombs dropped in World War II (ionizing radiation) and more recently by the increase in melanoma (skin cancer) in individuals exposed to too much sunlight (ultraviolet radiation).

Although chemical carcinogens are believed to be risk factors for many human cancers, a direct link to specific cancers has been established in only a few cases, the most important being lung cancer and the other cancers (of the larynx, pharynx, stomach, liver, pancreas, bladder, cervix, and more) that are associated with smoking. Epidemiological studies (Figure 24-8) first indicated that cigarette smoking was the major cause of lung cancer, but the reason was
![li23135345559](li23135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-8 Chemical carcinogenesis by tobacco smoke.
Cigarette smoking provides a clear example of a deadly form of chemical carcinogenesis. The rates of lung cancer follow the rates of smoking, with about a 30-year lag. Women began to smoke in large numbers starting in the 1960s, and starting in the 1990s, lung cancer passed breast cancer as the leading cause of women's cancer deaths. At the same time, a gradual decrease in smoking rates among men starting in the 1960s has been reflected in a decrease in their lung cancer rate. [Data from the American Cancer Society.]
unclear until the discovery that about 60 percent of human lung cancers contain inactivating mutations in the $p 53$ gene, which, as we will soon see, is a major tumor-suppressor gene. The chemical benzo(a)pyrene, found in cigarette smoke as well as in coal tar, undergoes metabolic activation in the lungs (Figure 24-9) to form a potent mutagen that mainly
![li23235345559](li23235345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-9 Enzymatic processing of benzo(a)pyrene to a more potent mutagen and carcinogen. Liver enzymes, particularly P-450 enzymes, modify benzo(a)pyrene in a series of reactions, producing 7,8-diol-9,10-epoxide, a highly potent mutagenic species that reacts with DNA primarily at the $\mathrm{N}_{2}$ atom of a guanine base. The resulting adduct, $(+)$-trans-anti-B(a)P- $\mathrm{N}^{2}$-dG, causes polymerase to insert an A
rather than a C opposite the modified G base. Next time the DNA is replicated, a T will be inserted opposite the A, and the mutation will be complete. Horizontal arrows indicate alterations toward greater potency, while vertical arrows indicate changes in the direction of reduced toxicity. The large "O" symbol represents the rest of the multi-ring structure shown in the complete benzo(a)pyrene molecule at the left.

causes conversion of guanine (G) to thymine (T) bases, a transversion mutation. When applied to cultured bronchial epithelial cells, activated benzo $(a)$ pyrene induces many mutations, including inactivating mutations at codons 175,248 , and 273 of the $p 53$ gene. These same positions, all within the protein's DNA-binding domain, are major mutational hot spots in human lung cancer. In fact, the nature of the mutations in $p 53$ (and other cancer-related genes) found in tumor cells gives us clues as to the origin of the cancer. The G-to-T transversions caused by benzo(a)pyrene, for example, are present in the $p 53$ genes of about one-third of smokers' lung tumors. That type of mutation is relatively rare among the $p 53$ mutations found in other types of tumors. The carcinogen leaves its footprint. Thus there is a strong correlation between one defined chemical carcinogen in cigarette smoke and human cancer. It is likely that other chemicals in cigarette smoke induce mutations in other genes, since it contains more than 60 carcinogens.

Lung cancer is not the only major human cancer for which a clear-cut risk factor has been identified. Asbestos exposure is linked to mesothelioma, another type of lung cancer. Aflatoxin, a fungal metabolite found in moldy grains, induces liver cancer. Furthermore, cooking meat at high temperatures causes chemical reactions that form heterocyclic amines (HCAs), potent mutagens that cause colon and breast carcinomas in animal models. Hard evidence concerning dietary and environmental risk factors that would help us avoid other common cancers (e.g., breast, colon, and prostate cancer and leukemias) is, however, generally lacking.

## The Multi-hit Model Can Explain the Progress of Cancer

As we have just seen, mutations cause cancer. However, luckily for us, multiple mutations are usually required to convert a normal body cell into a malignant one. According to this multi-hit model, cancers arise by a process of evolutionary (or "survival of the fittest") clonal selection not unlike the selection of individual animals in a large population. Here is the scenario, which may or may not apply to all cancers: A mutation in one cell gives it a slight growth advantage. One of its progeny cells then undergoes a second mutation that allows its descendants to grow more uncontrollably and form a small benign tumor. A third mutation in a cell within this tumor allows it to outgrow the others and overcome constraints imposed by the tumor microenvironment, and its progeny form a mass of cells, each of which has these three genetic changes. An additional mutation in one of these cells allows its progeny to escape into the bloodstream and establish daughter colonies at other sites, the hallmark of metastatic cancer.

This model makes two easily testable predictions. First, all cells in a given tumor should have at least some genetic alterations in common. Systematic analysis of cells from individual human tumors supports the prediction that all the cells in a tumor are derived from a single progenitor. Second, cancer incidence should increase with age because it can take decades for the required multiple mutations to
![li23335345559](li23335345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 24-10 The incidence of human cancers increases as a function of age. The marked increase in the incidence of cancer with age is consistent with the multi-hit model of cancer induction. Note that the logarithm of annual incidence is plotted versus the logarithm of age.

occur. Assuming that the rate of mutation is roughly constant during a lifetime, the incidence of most types of cancer would be independent of age if only one mutation were required to convert a normal cell into a malignant one. As the data in Figure 24-10 show, the incidence of many types of human cancer increases drastically with age. In fact, current estimates suggest that five to six "hits," or mutations, must accumulate as the most dangerous cancer cells emerge.

More direct evidence that multiple mutations are required for tumor induction comes from experiments with transgenic mice, which have shown that a variety of combinations of oncogenes can cooperate in causing cancer. For example, mice have been made that carry either the mutant ras ${ }^{V 12}$ dominant oncogene (one version of $\operatorname{ras}^{l 1}$ ) or the MYC proto-oncogene, in each case under the control of a mammary-cell-specific promoter/enhancer from a retrovirus. This promoter is induced by endogenous hormone levels and tissue-specific regulators, leading to overexpression of MYC or ras ${ }^{V 12}$ in breast tissue.

The MYC protein is a transcription factor that induces expression of many genes required for the transition from the $G_{1}$ to the $S$ phase of the cell cycle. Heightened transcription of MYC in these mice mimics previously identified oncogenic mutations that increase MYC transcription, converting the proto-oncogene into an oncogene. By itself, the MYC transgene causes tumors only after 100 days, and then in only a few mice; clearly only a minute fraction of the mammary cells that overproduce the MYC protein actually become malignant. Production of the mutant $\mathrm{Ras}^{V 12}$ protein alone causes tumors earlier, but still slowly and with about 50 percent efficiency over 150 days. When the MYC and ras ${ }^{V 12}$ overexpressing transgenics are crossed, however, all mammary cells in their offspring overproduce both MYC

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 24-11 The kinetics of tumor appearance in female mice carrying either one or two oncogenic transgenes shows the cooperative nature of multiple mutations in cancer induction. Each of the transgenes was driven by the mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) breast-specific promoter. The hormonal stimulation associated with pregnancy activates the MMTV promoter and hence the overexpression of the transgenes in mammary tissue. The graph shows the time course of tumorigenesis in mice carrying either MYC or ras ${ }^{V 12}$ transgenes as well as in the progeny of a cross of MYC carriers with ras ${ }^{V 12}$ carriers, which contain both transgenes. The results clearly demonstrate the cooperative effects of multiple mutations in cancer induction. See E. Sinn et al., 1987, Cell 49:465.
and $\mathrm{Ras}^{\mathrm{V} 12}$, tumors arise much more rapidly, and all animals succumb to cancer (Figure 24-11). Such experiments emphasize the synergistic effects of multiple oncogenes. They also suggest that the long latency of tumor formation, seen even in the double-transgenic mice, is due to the need to acquire still more mutations.

## Successive Oncogenic Mutations Can Be Traced in Colon Cancers

Studies on colon cancer provide the most compelling evidence to date for the multi-hit model of cancer induction. Surgeons can obtain fairly pure samples of many human cancers, but since the tumor is observed at only one time, its exact stage of progression cannot be easily determined. An exception is colon cancer, which evolves through distinct, well-characterized morphological stages. Its intermediate stages-polyps, benign adenomas, and carcinomas-can be isolated by a surgeon, allowing mutations that occur in each of these stages to be identified. Numerous studies have shown that colon cancer arises from a series of mutations that commonly occur in a well-defined order, providing strong support for the multi-hit model (Figure 24-12).

Insight into the progression of colon cancer first came from the study of inherited predispositions to colon cancer such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway have been identified in many of these syndromes, and it is now believed that deregulation of Wnt signaling results in formation of polyps (precancerous growths) on the inside of the colon wall-not only in people with inherited polyposis syndromes, but also in people afflicted with sporadic (noninherited) forms of colon cancer. The APC (adenomatous polyposis coli) protein is a negative
regulator of Wnt signaling (see Chapter 16), which promotes cell cycle entry by activating expression of the MYC gene. The absence of functional APC protein thus leads to inappropriate production of MYC, and cells homozygous for APC mutations proliferate at a rate higher than normal and form polyps. Loss-of-function mutations in the APC gene are the most frequent mutations found in early stages of colon cancer. Most of the cells in a polyp contain the same one or two mutations in the APC gene that result in its loss or inactivation, indicating that they are clones of the cell in which the original mutation occurred. Thus APC is a tumor-suppressor gene, and both alleles of the APC gene must carry an inactivating mutation for polyps to form because cells with one wild-type APC allele express enough APC protein to function normally.

If one of the cells in a polyp undergoes another mutation, this time an activating mutation of the ras gene, its progeny divide in an even more uncontrolled fashion, forming a larger adenoma. Inactivation of the p53 gene follows and results in the gradual loss of normal regulation and the consequent formation of a malignant carcinoma (see Figure 24-12). The p53 protein is a tumor suppressor that halts progression through the cell cycle in response to DNA damage and other stresses. While the three "hits" listed here are certainly crucial parts of the picture, there are likely to be additional contributing genetic events. Not every colon cancer, however, acquires all the later mutations or acquires them in the order depicted in Figure 24-12. Thus different combinations of mutations may result in the same phenotype.

DNA from different human colon carcinomas generally contains mutations in all three genes mentioned here-loss-of-function mutations in the tumor suppressors APC and p53 and an activating (gain-of-function) mutation in the oncogene $K$-ras (one of the ras family of genes)-establishing that multiple mutations in the same cell are needed for the cancer to form. Some of these mutations appear to confer growth advantages at an early stage of tumor development, whereas other mutations promote the later stages, including invasion and metastasis, which are required for the malignant phenotype. The number of mutations needed for colon cancer progression may at first seem surprising, and might seem to be an effective barrier to tumorigenesis. Our genomes, however, are under constant assault. Recent estimates indicate that sporadically arising polyps have about 11,000 genetic alterations in each cell, though very likely only a few of these alterations are relevant to oncogenesis. The genetic instability that is a hallmark of cancer cells promotes further tumor evolution, allowing for the accelerated creation of tumor cells with increased self-reliance and the ability to metastasize.

Colon carcinoma provides an excellent example of the multi-hit model of cancer. The degree to which this model applies to cancer generally is only now being learned, but it is clear that many types of cancer involve multiple mutations.

## Cancer Development Can Be Studied in Cultured Cells and in Animal Models

Most cultured cells have a finite lifespan (see Chapter 4). After about 50 divisions, human cells cease to divide and eventually

![li23535345559](li23535345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-12 The development and metastasis of human colorectal cancer and its genetic basis. A mutation in the APC tumor-suppressor gene in a single epithelial cell causes the cell to divide (although surrounding epithelial cells do not), forming a mass of localized benign tumor cells, called a polyp. Subsequent mutations lead to expression of a constitutively active Ras protein and loss of the tumor-suppressor gene p53. These mutations, together with additional genetic changes yet to be identified, generate a malignant cell. The cell continues to divide, and its progeny invade the basement membrane that surrounds the tissue, but do not penetrate the basement membrane of capillaries (bottom left). Some tumor cells spread into blood vessels that will distribute them to other sites in the body (bottom right). Additional mutations permit the tumor cells to exit from the blood vessels and proliferate at distant sites. See B. Vogelstein and K. Kinzler, 1993, Trends Genet. 9:138-141.
die due to erosion of their telomeres (see Figure 4-1a). Some cells, however, escape this fate and become immortal; that is, they gain the ability to divide indefinitely. Immortalization is mediated by several kinds of mutations, including loss-of-function mutations in the $p 19 A R F$ or $p 53$ genes, which are regulators of the cell cycle and cell survival. These mutations allow cells to grow for an unlimited time in culture if they are periodically diluted and supplied with nutrients (see Figure 4-1b).

![li23635345559](li23635345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-13 Conditional mouse models of cancer. In the inactivating system (a), an exon of interest is flanked by two loxP or FRT sites as shown. Expression of the Cre or FLP recombinase leads to homologous recombination between the two loxP and FRT sites, respectively. This recombination leads to excision of the exon, rendering the gene nonfunctional. In the activating system (b), an additional exon with a stop codon is introduced into the gene of interest, making the gene nonfunctional. This exon is flanked by loxP or FRT sites. When Cre or FLP recombinase is induced, the stop codon-containing exon is recombined out, and the gene of interest is expressed.

Immortal cells are not full-blown cancer cells. When they are introduced into an immunocompromised mouse, they fail to form tumors. When further oncogenic mutations are introduced, however, they turn into cancer cells. For example, when a mutant ras gene encoding ras ${ }^{D}$, a hyperactive form of the Ras protein, is introduced into immortal cells, they are transformed into cancer cells. As we will see in Section 24.3, any gene, such as ras ${ }^{D}$, that encodes a protein capable of transforming immortalized cells into cancer cells is considered an oncogene. Cell culture experiments have not only provided insights into how oncogenes cause cancer, but have also supported the idea that multiple hits are needed to transform a normal cell into a cancer cell.

Genetically engineered mice have also provided tremendous insights into the steps of tumor initiation and progression. Using mouse models to study cancer is not always straightforward, however. Many tumor-suppressor genes serve essential functions during normal mouse development, so mice lacking both copies of these genes are not viable. The essential functions of these genes during early embryogenesis preclude the study of their role in tumor progression. To circumvent this problem, researchers have begun to employ conditional "knock-in" and "knockout" strategies that allow for the targeted activation or inactivation of a gene in a certain tissue or at a certain stage of development.

In the conditional mouse model, an allele of a particular oncogene or tumor-suppressor gene is wild type until activated or inactivated with exogenous chemicals or viruses in a tissue- or time-specific manner. At the heart of these conditional systems are the Cre and FLP recombinases. These recombinases facilitate homologous recombination between loxP and FRT sites, respectively (Figure 24-13; see also Figure 6-39). When the recombinases are under the control of a tissue-specific promoter, recombination occurs only in the tissue that produces the recombinase. The recombinase method can be used in two ways. First, the recombinase target sites may flank an exon. Upon induction of the recombinase, that exon is lost and the gene is inactivated (Figure 24-13a). This method is especially useful for inactivating tumorsuppressor genes in a tissue-specific manner. Second, expression of an oncogene can be controlled by introducing into the oncogene an additional exon that contains a stop codon, which makes the gene nonfunctional. However, if the
additional exon is flanked by recombinase target sites, the oncogene will be expressed upon induction of the recombinase (Figure 24-13b). Using this system, researchers have examined the role of oncogenic forms of Ras in the mouse and have, using a conditional oncogenic ras allele, created a mouse model of human lung cancer.

The development of promoters that can be regulated by exogenously added chemicals has provided an additional powerful method of controlling gene expression in experimental animals. The most widely used of these methods are the Tet-On and Tet-Off systems. Each system is composed of two parts: the Tet operon promoter, which regulates the expression of the gene of interest, and one of two versions of the transcription factor that binds to the promotereither the transactivator tTA (in the case of Tet-Off) or the reverse transactivator rtTA (in the case of Tet-On). Both transcription factors bind to the Tet operator to induce gene expression, and both are regulatable by tetracycline or by the tetracycline analog doxycycline, more commonly used by scientists in their experiments. The difference between the two systems lies in the responses of tTA and rtTA to doxycycline binding. Doxycycline inhibits tTA from binding the promoter; thus, in the Tet-Off system, addition of doxycycline turns off transcription. In the Tet-On system, rtTA cannot bind the promoter in the absence of doxycycline, and addition of the drug induces transcription. Doxycycline can be administered by simply adding it to the animals' water supply. Placing the Tet transcriptional regulators under the control of tissue-specific promoters therefore allows for temporal as well as spatial control of gene expression.

By using the Tet-Off system to control MYC expression, researchers found that survival of a tumor depends on the continuous production of MYC protein. When expression of MYC was even briefly interrupted, osteogenic sarcoma cells ceased dividing and developed into mature osteocytes (Figure 24-14). It is now clear that the continuous activity of oncogenes is required for the survival of many types of tumors. This dependence of tumors on the continuous production of oncogene-encoded proteins, termed oncogene addiction, may provide new opportunities for treatment. Specific inhibitors of these oncogene-encoded proteinseven when applied only transiently-could lead to disease regression.

![li23735345559](li23735345559.jpg)

EXPERIMENTAL FIGURE 24-14 MYC is continuously needed for tumor growth. Transgenic mice were developed in which MYC expression was driven by the Tet-Off system. One percent of such mice develop osteogenic sarcomas. Wild-type mice were transplanted with osteogenic sarcomas, which causes them to develop the disease. In the transplanted mice, MYC expression was repressed by treating the mice with doxycycline. This treatment caused the osteogenic sarcomas to stop proliferating (a) and differentiate into mature osteocytes (b). After MYC expression was turned off, the tumor cells also lost alkaline phosphatase activity, a marker for osteogenic sarcomas (c, d). Surprisingly, re-expression of MYC protein did not trigger a return to the sarcoma state.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 24.2

## The Origins and Development of Cancer

- Changes in the DNA sequence can result from DNA copying errors and the effects of carcinogens. All carcinogens are mutagens; that is, they act by altering one or more nucleotides in DNA.
- Indirect-acting carcinogens, the most common type of carcinogen, must be activated before they can damage DNA. In animals, metabolic activation occurs via the cytochrome P-450 system, a pathway generally used by cells to rid themselves of noxious foreign chemicals. Direct-acting carcinogens such as EMS and DMS require no such cellular modifications in order to damage DNA.
- Benzo(a)pyrene, a component of cigarette smoke, causes inactivating mutations in the $p 53$ gene, thus contributing to the initiation of human lung tumors.
- The multi-hit model, which proposes that multiple mutations are needed to cause cancer, is consistent with the genetic homogeneity of cells from a given tumor, the observed increase in the incidence of human cancers with advancing age, and the cooperative effect of oncogenic transgenes and tumor-suppressor gene mutations on tumor formation in mice.
- Colon cancer develops through distinct morphological stages that are commonly associated with mutations in specific tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes.
- Cultured cells and mice in which oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes can be expressed in a time- and tissuespecific manner teach us about how cancers arise and how these genes contribute to the development and progression of the disease.


### 24.3 The Genetic Basis of Cancer

As we have noted, mutations in three broad classes of genes-proto-oncogenes (e.g., RAS), tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., APC), and genome maintenance genes-play key roles in cancer induction (Table 24-1). These genes encode many kinds of proteins that help control cell growth and proliferation (Figure 24-15). Virtually all human tumors have inactivating mutations in genes whose products normally act in various cell cycle checkpoint pathways to stop a cell's progress through the cell cycle if a previous step has occurred incorrectly or if DNA has been damaged. For example, most cancers have inactivating mutations in the genes coding for one or more proteins that normally restrict progression through the $G_{1}$ stage of the cell cycle or activating mutations in genes coding for proteins that drive the cells through the cell cycle. Likewise, a constitutively active RAS or other activated signal-transducing proteins are found in several kinds of human tumors that have different origins. Thus malignancy and the intricate processes for controlling the cell cycle discussed in Chapter 19 are two faces of the same coin. In the series of events leading to the growth of a tumor, oncogenes combine with tumor-suppressor mutations to give rise to the full spectrum of tumor-cell properties described in the previous sections. In this section, we consider the general types of mutations that cause cancer and explain why some inherited mutations increase the risk for particular cancers. We end the section with a description of how the molecular analysis of tumors is changing the manner in which cancer is treated. Personalized medicine-the ability to diagnose individual tumors at the molecular level and to design treatments for a patient's specific cancer-is likely to become a reality in the twenty-first century.

FIGURE 24-15 Cancer can result from the expression of mutant forms of seven types of proteins. Mutations changing the structure or expression of proteins that normally promote cell growth generally give rise to dominantly acting oncogenes. Many, but not all, extracellular signaling molecules (I), signal receptors (II), signal-transducing proteins (III), and transcription factors (IV) are in this category. Cell cycle control proteins (V), which function to restrain cell proliferation, and DNA-repair proteins (VI) are encoded by tumor-suppressor genes. Mutations in these genes act recessively, greatly increasing the probability that the mutant cells will become tumor cells or that mutations will occur in other gene classes. Apoptotic proteins (VII) include tumor suppressors that promote apoptosis and oncoproteins that promote cell survival.

or to induce cancer in animals is considered to be an oncogene. Of the many known oncogenes, all but a few are derived from normal cellular genes (i.e., proto-oncogenes) whose wild-type products promote cell proliferation or other features important to cancer. For example, the RAS gene discussed previously is a proto-oncogene that encodes an intracellular signal-transducing protein that promotes cell division; the mutant ras ${ }^{\text {f7 }}$ gene derived from RAS is an oncogene whose protein product provides an excessive or uncontrolled proliferation-promoting signal. Other protooncogenes encode growth-promoting signaling molecules and their receptors, anti-apoptotic (cell-survival) proteins, and transcription factors.

Conversion of a proto-oncogene into an oncogene, also called activation, generally involves a gain-of-function mutation. At least four mechanisms can produce oncogenes from the corresponding proto-oncogenes:

1. A point mutation (i.e., a change in a single base pair) in a proto-oncogene that results in a hyperactive or constitutively active protein product
2. A chromosomal translocation that fuses two genes together to produce a hybrid gene encoding a chimeric protein whose activity, unlike that of the parent proteins, is constitutive
3. A chromosomal translocation that brings a growth regulatory gene under the control of alternative enhancers that cause inappropriate expression of the gene

(a) Homogeneously staining regions (HSRs) in a human chromosome from a neuroblastoma cell. The chromosomes are uniformly stained with a blue dye so that all can be seen. Specific DNA sequences were detected using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), in which fluorescently labeled DNA clones are hybridized to denatured DNA in the chromosomes. The chromosome 4 pair is marked by in situ hybridization with a chromosome paint probe for the long arm of chromosome 4 (red). On one of the chromosome 4's an HSR is visible after hybridizing with a

An oncogene formed by either of the first two mechanisms encodes an oncoprotein that differs from the normal protein encoded by the corresponding proto-oncogene. In contrast, the other two mechanisms generate oncogenes whose protein products are identical to the normal proteins; their oncogenic effect is due to their production at higher than normal levels or in cells where they are not normally produced.

Localized amplification of DNA to produce as many as a hundred copies of a given region (usually a region spanning hundreds of kilobases) is a common genetic change seen in tumors. Normally such an event would be repaired, or the cell would be stopped from cycling by checkpoint pathways, so such lesions imply a DNA-repair defect of some kind. These amplifications may take either of two forms: the duplicated DNA may occur at a single site on a chromosome, or it may exist as small, independent mini-chromosome-like structures. The first form leads to a homogeneously staining region (HSR) that is visible in the light microscope at the site of the amplification; the second form causes extra "minute" chromosomes, separate from the normal chromosomes, that pepper a stained chromosomal preparation (Figure 24-16).

However they arise, a central aspect of oncogenes is that the gain-of-function mutations that convert proto-oncogenes to oncogenes are genetically dominant; that is, mutation in only one of the two alleles is sufficient for induction of cancer.

## Cancer-Causing Viruses Contain Oncogenes or Activate Cellular Proto-oncogenes

Pioneering studies by Peyton Rous beginning in 1911 led to the initial recognition that a virus could cause cancer when injected into a suitable host animal. Many years later, molecular biologists showed that his Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) is a retrovirus whose RNA genome is reverse-transcribed into DNA, which is then incorporated into the host-cell genome (see Figure 5-48). In addition to the "normal" genes present in all retroviruses, oncogenic transforming viruses such as RSV contain an oncogene: in the case of RSV, the v-src gene. Subsequent studies with mutant forms of RSV demonstrated that only the v-src gene, not the other viral genes, was required for cancer induction.

In the late 1970s, scientists were surprised to find that normal cells from chickens and other species contain a gene that is closely related to the RSV v-src gene. This normal cellular gene, a proto-oncogene, is commonly distinguished from the viral gene by the prefix "c" for "cellular" (c-SRC). RSV and other oncogenic transforming viruses are thought to have arisen by incorporating a normal host cellular protooncogene into their genome. Subsequent mutation in the incorporated gene then converted it into a dominantly acting oncogene able to transform host cells even in the presence of the normal c-SRC proto-oncogene. When this phenomenon was first discovered, it was startling to find that these dangerous viruses were turning the hosts' own genes against them.

Because its genome carries the potent v-src oncogene, RSV induces tumors within days. RSV is said to be an acute retrovirus. In contrast, most oncogenic retroviruses induce cancer only after a period of months or years. The genomes of these slow-acting retroviruses, which are weakly oncogenic, differ from those of viruses such as RSV in one crucial respect: they lack an oncogene. All slow-acting, or "longlatency," retroviruses appear to cause cancer by integrating into the host-cell DNA near a cellular proto-oncogene and activating its expression. The long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences in integrated retroviral DNA can act as enhancers or promoters for a nearby cellular gene, thereby stimulating its transcription. For example, in the cells from tumors caused by avian leukosis virus (ALV), the retroviral DNA is inserted near the MYC gene. These cells overproduce MYC protein; as noted earlier, overproduction of MYC causes abnormally rapid proliferation of cells. Slow-acting viruses act slowly for two reasons: integration near a cellular protooncogene (e.g., MYC) is a random, rare event, and additional mutations have to occur before a full-fledged tumor becomes evident.

In natural bird and mouse populations, slow-acting retroviruses are much more common than oncogenic retroviruses such as Rous sarcoma virus. Thus insertional proto-oncogene activation is probably the major mechanism by which retroviruses cause cancer. Although the only retrovirus known to cause human tumors is human T-cell lymphotrophic virus (HTLV), the huge investment made in studying retroviruses paid off both in the discovery of cellular oncogenes and in a sophisticated understanding of retroviruses, which later accelerated progress on the HIV virus that causes AIDS.

A few DNA viruses are also oncogenic. The normal replication cycle of these viruses does not involve integration into the host-cell genome, but viral DNA can become integrated into a chromosome of a host cell by cellular DNA repair processes. Although this is a rare event that is lethal to the virus, if the viral DNA expresses an oncogene, the host cell can become cancerous. For example, many warts and other benign tumors of epithelial cells are caused by the DNA-containing human papillomaviruses (HPV). A medically much more serious outcome of HPV infection is cervical cancer, the third most common type of cancer in women after lung and breast cancer. The Pap smear, which is used to sample the cervical tissue and screen for possible cancers, is thought to have reduced the death rate from cervical cancer by about 70 percent. We will learn more about HPV oncoproteins later in the chapter.

Unlike retroviral oncogenes, which are derived from normal cellular genes and have no function for the virus except to allow its proliferation in tumors, the known oncogenes of DNA viruses are integral parts of the viral genome and are required for viral replication. As we will see, the oncoproteins expressed from integrated viral DNA in infected cells act in various ways to stimulate cell growth and proliferation.

## Loss-of-Function Mutations in TumorSuppressor Genes Are Oncogenic

Tumor-suppressor genes generally encode proteins that in one way or another inhibit cell proliferation. Loss-offunction mutations in one or more of these proliferation inhibitory proteins contribute to the development of many cancers. Prominent among the classes of proteins encoded by tumor-suppressor genes are these five:

1. Intracellular proteins that regulate or inhibit entry into the cell cycle (e.g., p16 and Rb)
2. Receptors or signal transducers for secreted hormones or developmental signals that inhibit cell proliferation (e.g., TGF- $\beta$ )
3. Checkpoint pathway proteins that arrest the cell cycle if DNA is damaged (e.g., p53)
4. Proteins that promote apoptosis
5. Enzymes that participate in DNA repair

Generally, one copy of a tumor-suppressor gene suffices to control cell proliferation, so both alleles of a tumor-suppressor gene must be lost or inactivated in order to promote tumor development. Thus tumorigenesis-promoting loss-of-function mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are recessive (see Table 24-1). In this context, recessive means that if there is even one working gene copy, producing about half the usual amount of protein product, tumor formation will be prevented. With some genes, however, half the normal amount of product is not enough, in which case the loss of just one of the two gene copies can lead to cancer. This kind of gene is said to be haplo-insufficient. The loss of one copy

of the gene is decisive for the final phenotype, so this type of mutation is dominant. It is useful to remember, then, the two processes by which cancer-causing genes can be dominant: (1) loss of one copy of a haplo-insufficient tumorsuppressor gene, resulting in insufficient product to control cell proliferation, and (2) activation of a gene or protein that causes cell proliferation even in the presence of one normal allele-that is, a dominant oncogene (as described in the previous section). In many cancers, tumor-suppressor genes have deletions or point mutations that prevent production of any protein or lead to production of a nonfunctional protein. Another mechanism for inactivating tumor-suppressor genes is methylation of cytosine residues in their promoters or other control elements, which inhibits their transcription. Such methylation is commonly found in nontranscribed regions of DNA (see Chapter 9).

## Inherited Mutations in Tumor-Suppressor Genes Increase Cancer Risk

Individuals with inherited mutations in tumor-suppressor genes have a hereditary predisposition to certain cancers. Such individuals generally inherit a germ-line mutation in one allele of the gene; somatic mutation of the second allele facilitates tumor progression. A classic case is retinoblastoma, which is caused by loss of function of $R B$, the first tumorsuppressor gene to be identified. As discussed in Chapter 19, the protein encoded by $R B$ regulates cell cycle entry.

Children with hereditary retinoblastoma inherit one defective copy of the $R B$ gene, sometimes seen as a small deletion on one of the two copies of chromosome 13. These children develop multiple retinal tumors early in life and generally in both eyes. The loss or inactivation of the normal $R B$ gene on the other chromosome is an essential step in tumor formation, giving rise to a cell that produces no functional Rb protein (Figure 24-17a). Individuals with sporadic retinoblastoma, in contrast, inherit two normal $R B$ alleles, each of which has undergone a loss-of-function somatic mutation or loss in a single retinal cell (Figure 24-17b). Because losing two copies of the $R B$ gene is far less likely than losing one, sporadic retinoblastoma is rare and usually affects only one eye.

If retinal tumors are removed before they become malignant, children with hereditary retinoblastoma often survive until adulthood and produce children, but are at an increased risk of developing other types of tumors later in life. Because their germ cells contain one normal and one mutant $R B$ allele, these individuals will, on average, pass on the mutant allele to half their children and the normal allele to the other half. Children who inherit the normal allele are normal if their other parent has two normal $R B$ alleles. However, those who inherit the mutant allele have the same enhanced predisposition to develop retinal tumors as their affected parent, even though they inherit a normal $R B$ allele from their other, normal parent. Thus the tendency to develop retinoblastoma is inherited as a dominant trait: one
mutant copy is sufficient to predispose a person to develop the cancer.

As we will see shortly, many human tumors (not just retinal tumors) contain mutant $R B$ alleles or mutations affecting other components of the Rb pathway; most of these tumors arise as the result of somatic mutations. Although hereditary retinoblastoma cases number about 100 per year in the United States, about 100,000 other cancer cases each year involve $R B$ mutations acquired postconception.

Similar hereditary predispositions to other cancers have been associated with inherited mutations in other tumorsuppressor genes. For example, individuals who inherit a germ-line mutation in one APC allele develop thousands of precancerous intestinal polyps (see Figure 24-12). Since there is a high probability that one or more of these polyps will progress to malignancy, such individuals have a greatly increased risk of developing colon cancer before the age of 50. Screening for polyps by colonoscopy is a good idea for people 50 or older, even when no APC mutation is known to be present. Likewise, women who inherit one mutant allele of BRCA1, another tumor-suppressor gene, have a 60 percent probability of developing breast cancer by age 50, whereas those who inherit two normal BRCA1 alleles have a 2 percent probability of doing so. Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations also increase the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer from 2 percent to $15-40$ percent. The BRCA1 protein is involved in repairing radiation-induced DNA damage. In women who

(a) In hereditary (familial) retinoblastoma, a child inherits a normal $R B^{-}$allele from one parent and a mutant $R B^{-}$allele from the other parent.

inherit one mutant BRCA1 allele, loss of the second BRCA1 allele, together with other mutations, is required for a normal mammary duct cell to become malignant. However, BRCA1 generally is not mutated in sporadic breast cancer.

Estimates vary, but hereditary cancers (cancers that arise due in part to an inherited version of a gene) are thought to constitute about 10 percent of human cancers. Further work tracing the contributions of human genes seems likely to increase the percentage. It is important to remember, however, that the inherited germ-line mutation alone is not sufficient to cause tumor development. Not only must the inherited normal tumor-suppressor allele be lost or inactivated, but mutations affecting other genes must also occur for cancer to develop. Thus a person with a recessive tumor-suppressor gene mutation can be exceptionally susceptible to environmental mutagens such as radiation.
(a) Mis-segregation

FIGURE 24-18 Two mechanisms for loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of tumor-suppressor genes. A cell containing one normal and one mutant allele of a tumor-suppressor gene is generally phenotypically normal. (a) If formation of the mitotic spindle is defective, then the duplicated chromosomes bearing the normal and mutant alleles may segregate in an aberrant 3:1 ratio. A daughter cell that receives three chromosomes of a type can lose one, restoring the normal $2 n$ chromosome number. Sometimes the resultant cell will contain one normal

Mutation in only one copy of a tumor-suppressor gene itself typically does not cause cancer because the remaining normal allele prevents aberrant growth. However, the subsequent loss or inactivation of the remaining normal allele in a somatic cell, referred to as loss of heterozygosity ( $L O H$ ) causes cancer to develop. Three mechanisms exist that can cause the loss of the normal allele. First, the normal allele can become inactive due to a de novo inactivating mutation or deletion. Second, chromosome mis-segregation, as outlined in Figure 24-18a, can cause loss of the chromosome carrying the normal allele. Neither mechanism is particularly frequent. By far the most frequent mechanism for LOH is mitotic recombination between a chromatid bearing the normal allele and a homologous chromatid bearing a mutant allele. As illustrated in Figure 24-18b, subsequent chromosome segregation can

and one mutant allele, but sometimes it will be homozygous for the mutant allele. Such aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome constitution) is generally damaging or lethal to relatively undifferentiated cells that have to develop into the many complex structures of an organism, but can often be tolerated in clones of cells that have limited fates and duties.

generate a daughter cell that is homozygous for the mutant tumor-suppressor allele.

## Epigenetic Changes Can Contribute to Tumorigenesis

We have just seen how mutations can undermine control of cell proliferation by inactivating tumor-suppressor genes. However, these types of genes can also be silenced by repressing their expression. Changes in DNA methylation, as well as changes in the activity of histone-modifying enzymes or chromatin-remodeling complexes, are now recognized as major drivers of tumorigenesis.

As we saw in Chapter 9, DNA methylation occurs at cytosines of CpG islands, which are found largely in promoters of genes. Methylation of these Cs leads to repression of the promoters. A large fraction of colorectal cancers are characterized by DNA hypermethylation. DNA hypomethylation is also a hallmark of cancer. The promoters of many genes involved in cancer are hypomethylated, and expression of the genes under their control is therefore increased. For example, 25 percent of acute myeloid leukemias are characterized by DNA hypomethylation that is due to inactivating mutations in an enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of CpG dinucleotides. A recently discovered DNA modification related to DNA methylation involves the conversion of 5-methylcytosine at CpG islands to a hydroxylated variant (5-hydroxylmethylcytosine). This type of DNA modification has also been implicated in cancer. The enzymes that catalyze these conversions are members of the TET family of DNA hydroxylases. These enzymes require $\alpha$-ketoglutarate as cofactors and are inhibited by the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate (see Figure 24-4).

Genes encoding chromatin modifiers and regulators have also emerged as drivers of tumorigenesis. Systematic whole-genome sequencing of many tumor types has revealed highly recurrent alterations in approximately 40 genes encoding epigenetic regulators. Recurrent mutations were found in genes encoding enzymes that modify histones or that interpret these post-translational modifications. Genes encoding histone methyl transferases, histone demethylases, and histone acetyl transferases have all been found mutated in a wide variety of tumors. Interestingly, tumors typically harbor only a single mutated allele of a gene encoding a chromatin-modifying enzyme, indicating that these mutations are haplo-insufficient. Presumably, losing both alleles would kill the cell, but having only one functional allele alters the expression of target genes sufficiently to promote tumorigenesis.

Central among the chromatin-remodeling factors implicated in cancer are the SWI/SNF complexes. These large and diverse multiprotein complexes, which have an ATP-dependent helicase at their core, often control histone modification and chromatin remodeling (see Chapter 9). For example, they can cause changes in the positions or structures of nucleosomes, making genes accessible or inaccessible to DNA-binding proteins that control transcription. If a target gene is normally activated or repressed by SWI/SNF-mediated
chromatin changes, mutations in the genes encoding SWI or SNF proteins will cause changes in the expression of that gene. Studies with transgenic mice suggest that SWI/SNF plays a role in repressing the expression of E2F genes, thereby inhibiting progression through the cell cycle. Thus loss of SWI/SNF function, just like loss of Rb function, can lead to overgrowth and perhaps cancer. Indeed, in mice, the Rb protein recruits SWI/SNF proteins to repress transcription of the genes encoding E2Fs.

Recent evidence from humans and mice has strongly implicated the SNF5 gene in cancer. The SNF5 protein is a core member of the SWI/SNF complex. In humans, inactivating somatic SNF5 mutations cause rhabdoid tumors, which most commonly form in the kidney, and an inherited (familial) disposition to form brain and other tumors. Subsequent studies have found genes encoding various BAF proteins, which are also subunits of the SWI/SNF complex, to be mutated in 40 percent of renal cancers, 50 percent of ovarian cancers, and a high fraction of liver and bladder cancers. In summary, epigenetic misregulation has emerged as a major contributor to tumorigenesis. In hindsight, this notion is probably not surprising, given that epigenetic regulation offers the opportunity to change the expression of many factors and regulatory pathways simultaneously.

## Micro-RNAs Can Promote and Inhibit Tumorigenesis

In the last decade, a new class of oncogenic factors has emerged. Noncoding RNAs (RNAs that do not encode proteins), especially micro-RNAs (miRNAs), play a critical role in tumorigenesis. Generation of miRNAs typically involves the transcription of a precursor RNA that, through a number of processing steps, is trimmed down to a 20-22-nucleotidelong mature miRNA. The mature miRNA usually base-pairs with the $3^{\prime}$ untranslated region (UTR) of its target RNA and inhibits its translation, or sometimes causes its degradation. To date, more than 1500 miRNAs have been identified in humans and have been implicated in the regulation of as many as 30 percent of the cell's mRNAs, with fundamental roles in cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. A number of miRNAs have also been shown to function as tumor-suppressor genes or oncogenes.

The first known role for miRNAs in tumorigenesis was revealed by the analysis of chromosomal region 13q14.3. This genomic region is found deleted in most cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), prostate cancer, and pituitary adenomas. Characterization of the disease-causing deletion showed that the absence of two miRNAs, miR-15-a and miR-16-1, causes CLL. Mice with mutations in both miRNAs develop CLL. The two miRNAs appear to control cell proliferation genes. In their absence, proliferation of B cells is increased. Similarly, the let-7 family of miRNAs has been implicated in lung, colon, breast, and ovarian cancer. Let-7 miRNAs down-regulate the translation of Ras. Thus in the absence of the miRNAs, Ras is constitutively overproduced, contributing to tumorigenesis. Let-7 miRNAs have other targets as well, such as the oncogenic transcription factor MYC, which we will discuss in

![li24535345559](li24535345559.jpg)
detail in the next section. A general theme that emerges in the study of miRNAs in cancer is that each miRNA has multiple targets, and therefore ample opportunities to contribute to tumorigenesis.

Like proteins involved in tumorigenesis, miRNAs can function like tumor suppressors or oncogenes. The miRNAs miR-15-a and miR-16-1 act like tumor-suppressors; they normally inhibit cell proliferation, and their absence leads to cell growth. However, some miRNAs have also been found to be overexpressed in cancer, and their analysis indicates that they function like oncogenes. Of particular interest is miR-21, which is overexpressed in most solid tumors, including glioblastomas and breast, lung, pancreatic, and colon tumors. This miRNA targets several tumor-suppressor

genes, among them the gene encoding the PTEN phosphatase. Much more needs to be learned about how miRNAs contribute to tumorigenesis, but it is clear that through their ability to regulate many different genes, they can influence disease progression in more than one way.

## Researchers Are Identifying Drivers of Tumorigenesis

As we have seen, activating mutations in growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic genes and loss-of-function mutations in growth-inhibiting and cell death genes bring about oncogenic transformation. Identifying these mutations and understanding how the affected genes function is providing key insights into the process of tumorigenesis and paving the way for the development of new therapies. It is thus not surprising that researchers have long been hunting for oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes.

In the 1960s, researchers first realized that some cancers harbor characteristic chromosome alterations. Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), a common leukemia in humans, was found to be associated with the Philadelphia chromosome (Figure 24-19a), which is generated by a translocation between chromosomes 22 and 9 . The two chromosomes exchange their terminal regions, which leads to a characteristic alteration in the size of chromosome 22 that can be detected by light microscopy. At the breakpoint of this translocation, a new fusion protein, the $B C R-A B L$ fusion, is generated, creating a protein kinase that phosphorylates proteins that the wild-type ABL kinase normally does not phosphorylate, thereby activating many intracellular signal-transducing proteins. If this translocation occurs in a hematopoietic cell in the bone marrow, the activity of the chimeric $B C R-A B L$ oncogene results in the initial phase of CML, characterized by

an expansion in the number of white blood cells. A second loss-of-function mutation in a cell carrying the $B C R-A B L$ fusion (e.g., in the tumor-suppressor genes $p 53$ or $R B$ ) leads to acute leukemia, which is often fatal.

The CML chromosomal translocation was only the first of a long series of distinctive, or "signature," chromosomal translocations linked to particular forms of leukemia. Many of these translocations involve genes encoding transcriptional regulators, particularly transcriptional regulators of Hox genes, a group of transcription factors required for cell proliferation and differentiation during embryonic development. Each link that is found presents an opportunity for greater understanding of the disease, earlier diagnosis, and new therapies. In the case of CML, as we will see shortly, that second step to successful therapy has already been taken.

The development of DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized the hunt for cancer genes. Combining highthroughput sequencing methods with methods that specifically allow for the capture of the genomic DNA that contains known protein-coding sequences has facilitated the systematic analysis of human tumors. To date we have sequence information on virtually all human tumor types. Furthermore, the gathering of sequence information from many tumors of a specific type is beginning to generate comprehensive lists of mutations, amplifications, deletions, and translocations that are characteristic of specific tumor types. The picture that emerges shows that only a few cancer genes are mutated in a high proportion of any specific cancer type. Most are mutated in only $2-10$ percent of tumors of a particular type. This pattern makes the identification of cancer "driver mutations" among many cancer "passenger mutations" challenging, but with an ever-increasing number of tumor sequences and the development of statistical tools, scientists hope to be able to create comprehensive catalogues of true cancer genes and to assign degrees to which individual cancer genes contribute to the disease in the not too distant future.

Cancer genome sequencing also showed that different tumor types have dramatically different levels of genetic changes, with some cancer types harboring relatively few genetic changes and others exhibiting highly complex mutational patterns. It also appears that certain tumor types are associated with characteristic mutational patterns. For example, it was the cancer genome sequencing effort that discovered chromothripsis, the shattering and random stitching together of individual chromosomes, as a characteristic of aggressive neuroblastomas. Sequencing of tumor genomes not only holds great promise in identifying new cancer genes, but as we will see next, is also becoming an integral tool of disease treatment.

## Molecular Cell Biology Is Changing How Cancer Is Diagnosed and Treated

The identification of drivers of tumorigenesis has not only provided us with a molecular understanding of how cancer arises and progresses, but has also revolutionized the way cancers are diagnosed and treated. Each
difference between cancer cells and normal cells provides a new opportunity to identify a specific drug or treatment that kills only the cancer cells, or at least stops their uncontrolled growth. Thus knowledge of the molecular cell biology of a tumor is critical information that can be exploited by researchers to develop anticancer treatments that more precisely target cancer cells.

Breast cancer provides a good example of how molecular cell biology techniques have affected treatments, both curative and palliative. Until the rise in the incidence of lung cancer, resulting from an increase in women smokers, breast cancer was the most deadly cancer for women, and it remains the second most frequent cause of women's cancer deaths. The cause of breast cancer is unknown, but the frequency is increased if certain mutations are carried. Breast cancers are often diagnosed during routine mammogram (x-ray) examinations. Typically, a biopsy of a $1-2-\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ tissue mass is taken to check the diagnosis and is tested with antibodies to determine whether a high level of estrogen or progesterone receptors is present. These steroid receptors are capable of stimulating tumor growth and are sometimes expressed at high levels in breast cancer cells. If either receptor is present, it is exploited in the treatment. A drug called tamoxifen, which inhibits the estrogen receptor, can be used to deprive the tumor cells of a growth-stimulating hormone. The biopsy is also tested for amplification of the proto-oncogene HER2/ $N E U$, which, as we saw in Chapter 16, encodes human EGF receptor 2. A monoclonal antibody specific for HER2 has been a strikingly successful new treatment for the subset of breast cancers that overproduce HER2. HER2 antibody injected into the blood recognizes HER2 and causes it to be internalized, selectively killing the cancer cells without any apparent effect on normal breast (and other) cells that produce moderate amounts of HER2. Similarly, many lung cancers harbor an amplification of the EGF receptor locus. Treatment with the EGFR inhibitor erlotinib has dramatically increased the life expectancy of patients with this type of lung cancer.

Breast cancer is treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The first step is surgical resection (removal) of the tumor and examination of lymph nodes for evidence of metastatic disease, which is the major adverse prognostic factor. The subsequent treatment involves 8 weeks of chemotherapy with three different types of agents and 6 weeks of radiation. These harsh treatments are designed to kill the dividing cancer cells; however, they also cause a variety of side effects, including suppression of blood cell production, hair loss, nausea, and neuropathy. These effects can reduce the strength of the immune system, risking infection, and cause weakness due to poor oxygen supply. To help offset these effects, patients are given the growth factor G-CSF to promote the formation of neutrophils (a type of white blood cell that fights bacterial and fungal infections) and erythropoietin (Epo) to stimulate red blood cell formation. Despite all this treatment, an average-risk woman ( 60 years old, $2-\mathrm{cm}^{3}$ tumor, 1 positive lymph node) has a $30-40$ percent 10-year risk of succumbing to her cancer. This risk can be reduced by $10-15$ percent by hormone-blocking

treatment such as tamoxifen, exploiting the molecular data that show a hormone receptor present on the cancer cells. Mortality is reduced another 5-10 percent by treatment with antibodies against the HER2/NEU oncoprotein. Thus molecular biology is having a huge impact on breast cancer victim survival rates, though still far less than one would like.

The discovery of the Philadelphia chromosome and the critical oncogene it creates, the $B C R-A B L$ fusion, combined with the discovery of the molecular action of the ABL protein, together have led to a powerful new therapy for CML. After a painstaking search, an inhibitor of ABL kinase, named imatinib (Gleevec), was identified as a possible treatment for CML in the early 1990s. Imatinib, which binds directly to the ABL kinase active site and inhibits kinase activity, is highly lethal to CML cells while sparing normal cells (see Figure 24-19b, c). After clinical trials showing that imatinib is remarkably effective in treating CML despite some side effects, it was approved by the FDA in 2001 as the first cancer drug targeted to a signal-transducing protein unique to tumor cells. Imatinib inhibits several other tyrosine kinases that are implicated in different cancers and has been successful in trials for treating those diseases, including forms of gastrointestinal tumors, as well. There are 90 functional tyrosine kinases encoded in the human genome, so drugs related to imatinib may be useful in controlling the activities of all these proteins. One ongoing challenge is that tumor cells can evolve to be resistant to imatinib and other such drugs, necessitating the invention of alternative drugs.

To find more genetic alterations unique to a tumor that could be exploited for new therapies, researchers now use RNAi and genome editing technologies to identify genes that when inactivated cause tumor cells, but not normal cells, to die. This approach of identifying synthetic lethal interactions between different genetic alterations that on their own are not lethal was pioneered in budding yeast. With the development of genome-wide small hairpin RNA (shRNA) libraries (collections of RNAi constructs that target every gene in the human genome) and other genome-editing methodologies such as the CRISPR-Cas9 system (see Chapter 6), this approach is now also feasible in human cells. Tumor cells and normal cells are infected with pools of shRNA constructs, each of which harbors a unique sequence tag known as a "bar code." After a period of growth, the RNA constructs can be isolated and shRNAs that were lost from the pool can be identified by sequencing of the remaining constructs. The shRNAs that were lost point to the target gene being essential for viability in the cell type from which they were lost. Those shRNA constructs that cause lethality in tumor cells but not normal cells suggest that the genes they target are essential for the survival of a tumor cell, but not a normal cell. This approach has been used, for example, to identify genes that, when inactivated, cause selective lethality in cancer cells harboring an oncogenic form of $R A S$, the $K$-ras oncogene. The proteins encoded by these genes could provide novel targets for the development of new therapeutics for tumors that harbor oncogenic forms of RAS.

The vision for the future of medicine is that modern sequencing technologies, as well as genome-wide RNA and protein analysis technologies (see Chapter 3 and 6), will allow doctors to classify a tumor and provide a comprehensive list of the oncogenic lesions that drive cancer growth. Treatment will then be tailored to the unique properties of each patient's cancer. In many cancers, such as breast cancer and CML, we can already see this future taking shape.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 24.3

## The Genetic Basis of Cancer

- Dominant gain-of-function mutations in proto-oncogenes and recessive loss-of-function mutations in tumor-suppressor genes are oncogenic.
- Among the proteins encoded by proto-oncogenes are growth-promoting signaling proteins and their receptors, signal-transducing proteins, transcription factors, and antiapoptotic proteins.
- An activating mutation of one of the two alleles of a pro-to-oncogene converts it into an oncogene. This can occur by point mutation, gene amplification, gene translocation, or mis-expression.
- Tumor-suppressor genes encode proteins that directly or indirectly control progression through the cell cycle, such as checkpoint pathway proteins that arrest the cell cycle if a previous step has occurred incorrectly, components of growthinhibiting signaling pathways, and pro-apoptotic proteins.
- The first tumor-suppressor gene to be recognized, $R B$, is mutated in retinoblastoma and many other tumors; some component of the Rb pathway is altered in most tumors.
- Inheritance of a single mutant allele of $R B$ greatly increases the probability that a specific kind of cancer will develop, as is the case for many other tumor-suppressor genes (e.g., APC and BRCA1).
- In individuals born heterozygous for a tumor-suppressor gene mutation, a somatic cell can undergo loss of heterozygosity ( LOH ) by mutation or deletion of the normal allele, chromosome mis-segregation, mitotic recombination, or gene silencing.
- Mutations affecting epigenetic regulators such as histonemodifying enzymes or chromatin remodelers are associated with a variety of tumors.
- MicroRNAs can promote or inhibit tumorigenesis by affecting the expression of multiple oncoproteins.
- Novel sequencing technologies have greatly accelerated the discovery of genes involved in cancer and are having a profound impact on cancer diagnosis and treatment.
- The advent of molecular techniques for characterizing individual tumors is allowing the application of drugs and

antibody treatments that target the properties of a particular tumor. This strategy permits more effective treatment of individual patients and reduces the use of drugs or antibodies that will be ineffective and possibly toxic. These refinements have allowed substantial reduction in breast cancer mortality.

- Novel shRNA and genome editing methods allow for the identification of genes specifically required for the survival of cancer cells, thereby facilitating the discovery of new therapeutic targets.


### 24.4 Misregulation of Cell Growth and Death Pathways in Cancer

In this section, we examine in more detail how the deregulation of growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signaling pathways contributes to tumorigenesis. We first discuss how mutations that result in the unregulated, constitutive activity of certain proteins or in their overproduction promote cell proliferation and transformation. Next we discuss how loss-of-function mutations in differentiation pathways contribute to tumorigenesis. We end this section with a description of how misregulation of genes that control programmed cell death, such as p53, drives tumorigenesis.

## Oncogenic Receptors Can Promote Proliferation in the Absence of External Growth Factors

Hyperactivation of a growth-inducing signaling protein due to an alteration of the protein might seem a likely mechanism of cancer, but in fact this rarely occurs. Only one such naturally occurring oncogene, sis, has been discovered. The sis oncogene, which encodes an altered form of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), can aberrantly stimulate proliferation of cells that normally express the PDGF receptor when expressed at high levels. A more common event is that cancer cells begin to produce an unaltered growth factor that acts on the cell that produces it. This phenomenon is called autocrine stimulation.

In contrast, oncogenes encoding cell-surface receptors that transduce growth-promoting signals have been associated with several types of cancer. Many of these receptors have intrinsic protein tyrosine kinase activity in their cytosolic domains, which is quiescent until activated. Ligand binding to the external domains of these receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) leads to their dimerization and activation of their kinase activity, initiating an intracellular signaling pathway that ultimately promotes proliferation.

In some cases, a point mutation changes a normal RTK into one that dimerizes and is constitutively active even in the absence of ligand. For instance, a single point mutation converts the normal human EGF receptor 2 (HER2) into the

NEU oncoprotein ("NEU" for its first known role, in neuroblastoma), which is an initiator of certain mouse cancers (Figure 24-20, left). Similarly, human tumors called multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 produce a constitutively active dimeric glia-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) receptor that results from a point mutation in the extracellular domain. The GDNF receptor and the HER2 receptor are both protein tyrosine kinases, so the constitutively active forms excessively phosphorylate their downstream target proteins. In other cases, deletion of much of the extracellular ligand-binding domain produces a constitutively active oncogenic receptor. For example, deletion of the extracellular domain of the normal EGF receptor (Figure 24-20, right) converts it to the dimeric ErbB oncoprotein (from erythroblastosis virus, in which a viral version of the altered gene was first identified). Mutations leading to overproduction of a normal RTK can also be oncogenic. For instance, many human breast cancers overproduce a normal HER2 receptor

FIGURE 24-20 Effects of oncogenic mutations in protooncogenes that encode cell-surface receptors. Left: A mutation that alters a single amino acid (valine to glutamine) in the transmembrane region of the HER2 receptor causes dimerization of the receptor, even in the absence of the normal EGF-related ligand, transforming it into the oncoprotein NEU, a constitutively active kinase. Right: A deletion that causes loss of the extracellular ligand-binding domain in the EGF receptor leads, for unknown reasons, to constitutive activation of the kinase activity of the resulting oncoprotein, ErbB.

because of amplification of its encoding gene. As a result, the cells are stimulated to proliferate in the presence of very low concentrations of EGF and related hormones, concentrations too low to stimulate proliferation of normal cells (see Chapter 16).

## Many Oncogenes Encode Constitutively Active Signal-Transducing Proteins

A large number of oncogenes are derived from protooncogenes whose encoded proteins are components or regulators of signal transduction pathways-most prominent among them the Ras pathway. As we saw in Chapter 16, Ras is a key component in the transduction of signals from activated receptors to a cascade of protein kinases. In the first part of this pathway, a signal from an activated RTK is carried via two adapter proteins to RAS, converting it to the active GTP-bound form (see Figure 16-21). In the second part of the pathway, activated RAS transmits the signal via two intermediate protein kinases to MAP kinase. The activated MAP kinase then phosphorylates a number of transcription factors that induce synthesis of important growth and proliferation proteins (see Figure 16-26). Virtually every component of this RTK/Ras/MAP kinase signaling cascade has been identified as an oncogene or tumor-suppressor gene (Figure 24-21).

Among the best-studied oncogenes are the $r a s^{D}$ genes themselves, which were the first nonviral oncogenes to be
![li24735345559](li24735345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-21 RTK/RAS/MAP kinase pathway components are frequently mutated in cancer. Components of the RTK/RAS/MAP kinase pathway in which oncogenic mutations have been identified in human cancers are highlighted in green. Components that have been found mutated to cause inactivation of the gene in cancer cells are highlighted in red.
recognized (see Classic Experiment 24-1). Any one of a number of changes in RAS can lead to its uncontrolled and therefore dominant activity. In particular, if a point mutation substitutes any other amino acid for the glycine at position 12 in the RAS sequence, the normal protein is converted into a constitutively active oncoprotein (see Chapter 16). This simple mutation reduces the protein's GTPase activity, thus maintaining RAS in the active GTP-bound state. Activating RAS mutations short-circuit the first part of the RTK pathway, making upstream activation triggered by ligand binding to the receptor unnecessary. Constitutively active RAS oncoproteins are produced by many types of human tumors, including bladder, colon, mammary, skin, and lung carcinomas, neuroblastomas, and leukemias.

Constitutive RAS activation can also arise from a recessive loss-of-function mutation in a GTPase-activating protein (GAP). The normal function of a GAP is to accelerate hydrolysis of GTP and thus the conversion of active GTPbound Ras to inactive GDP-bound RAS (see Figure 3-34). The loss of GAP leads to sustained RAS activation of downstream signal-transducing proteins. For example, neurofibromatosis, a benign tumor of the sheath cells that surround nerves, is caused by loss of both alleles of NF1, which encodes a RAS GAP-type protein (see Figure 8-20). Individuals with neurofibromatosis have inherited a single mutant NF1 allele; subsequent somatic mutation in the other allele leads to formation of neurofibromas. Thus NF1, like $R B$, is a tumor-suppressor gene, and the tendency to develop neurofibromatosis, like hereditary retinoblastoma, is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.

Oncogenes encoding other altered components of the RTK/RAS/MAP kinase pathway have also been identified (see Figure 24-21). For example, constitutively active forms of RAF have been identified in approximately 50 percent of melanomas. As in the case of constitutively active forms of RAS, these mutant RAF forms are no longer responsive to regulatory signals coming from the cell surface and signal continuous cell growth and proliferation.

In addition to RTK/RAS/MAP kinase signaling pathway constituents, cytoplasmic protein kinases are frequently mutated in cancer. Indeed, the first oncogene to be discovered, v-src from Rous sarcoma retrovirus, encodes a constitutively active protein tyrosine kinase. At least eight mammalian proto-oncogenes encode a family of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases related to the SRC protein. In other instances, kinases are fused to other proteins, endowing the protein kinase with new specificity. The BCR-ABL fusion protein is an example of such an oncokinase. As described above, hyperactive kinases and oncokinases have been successfully targeted in cancer therapy.

## Inappropriate Production of Nuclear Transcription Factors Can Induce Transformation

Mutations that create oncogenes or damage tumorsuppressor genes eventually cause changes in gene expression. These changes can be measured by comparing the amounts

of different mRNAs produced in normal cells and in tumor cells. Since the most direct effect on gene expression is exerted by transcription factors, it is not surprising that many oncogenes encode transcription factors. Two examples are JUN and FOS, which initially were identified in transforming retroviruses and later found to be overexpressed in some human tumors. The JUN and FOS proto-oncogenes encode proteins that sometimes associate to form a heterodimeric transcription factor, called AP1, that binds to a sequence found in promoters and enhancers of many genes (see Figure 9-31a and Chapter 16). These proteins function as oncoproteins by activating the transcription of key genes that encode growth-promoting proteins or by inhibiting the transcription of growth-repressing genes.

Many nuclear proto-oncogene proteins are produced when normal cells are stimulated to grow, indicating their direct role in growth control. For example, PDGF treatment of quiescent mouse 3T3 cells induces an approximately 50 -fold increase in the production of the transcription factors FOS and MYC, the products of the FOS and MYC proto-oncogenes. Initially, there is a transient rise of FOS and later a more prolonged rise of MYC (Figure 24-22). The levels of both proteins decline within a few hours, a regulatory effect that may, in normal cells, help to avoid cancer. The FOS and MYC proteins stimulate transcription of genes encoding proteins that promote progression through the $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ phase of the cell cycle and the $\mathrm{G}_{1}$-to-S transition.

In normal cells, FOS and MYC mRNAs and the proteins they encode are intrinsically unstable and degrade rapidly after the genes are transcribed. Some of the genetic changes that turn FOS from a normal gene into an oncogene involve deletions of the sequences that normally make the FOS mRNA and protein short-lived. Conversion of the MYC proto-oncogene into an oncogene can occur by different mechanisms. In cells of the human tumor known as

Serum contains factors such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) that stimulate the growth of quiescent cells. One of the earliest effects of growth factors is to induce expression of FOS and MYC, whose encoded proteins are transcription factors. [Data from M. E. Greenberg and E. B.

FIGURE 24-23 Chromosomal translocation in Burkitt's
lymphoma. As a result of a translocation between chromosomes 8 and 14, the MYC gene is placed adjacent to the gene for part of the antibody heavy chain $\left(\mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{H}}\right)$, leading to overproduction of the MYC transcription factor in lymphocytes and hence their growth into a lymphoma.

Burkitt's lymphoma, the MYC gene is translocated to a site near the heavy-chain antibody genes, which are normally active in antibody-producing white blood cells (Figure 24-23). The MYC translocation is a rare aberration of the normal DNA rearrangements that occur during maturation of antibody-producing cells. The translocated MYC gene, now regulated by the antibody-gene enhancer, is continually highly expressed, causing the cell to become cancerous. Localized amplification of a segment of DNA containing the MYC gene, which occurs in several human tumors, also causes inappropriately high production of the otherwise normal MYC protein.

The MYC gene encodes a basic helix-loop-helix protein that acts as part of a set of interacting proteins that can dimerize in various combinations, bind to DNA, and coordinately regulate the transcription of target genes. Other members of this protein set include MAD, MAX, and MNT. MAX can heterodimerize with MYC, MAD, and MNT. MYC-MAX dimers regulate genes that control proliferation, such as cyclins. MAD proteins inhibit MYC proteins, which has led to an interest in using MAD proteins, or drugs that stimulate MAD proteins, to rein in excessive MYC activity that contributes to tumor formation. MYC protein complexes affect transcription by recruiting chromatin-modifying complexes containing histone acetyl transferases (which usually stimulate transcription; see Chapter 9) to MYC target genes. MAD and MNT work with the SIN3 co-repressor protein to bring in histone deacetylases that help to block transcription. Together, all these proteins form a regulatory network that employs protein-protein association, variations in DNA binding, and transcriptional regulation to control cell proliferation. Overproduction of MYC protein tips the scales in favor of cell growth and division.

## Aberrations in Signaling Pathways That Control Development Are Associated with Many Cancers

During normal development, secreted signals such as Hedgehog (Hh), Wnt, and TGF- $\beta$ are used to direct cells to particular developmental fates, which may include the property of rapid mitosis. The effects of such signals must be regulated

so that growth is limited to the right time and place. Among the mechanisms available for reining in the effects of these powerful developmental signals are inducible intracellular antagonists, receptor blockers, and competing signals. Mutations that prevent such restraining mechanisms from operating are likely to be oncogenic, causing inappropriate or cancerous growth.

The Hedgehog signaling pathway, which is used repeatedly during development to control cell fates, is a good example of a signaling pathway implicated in cancer induction. In the skin and cerebellum, one of the human Hh proteins, Sonic Hedgehog, stimulates cell division by binding to and inactivating a membrane protein called Patched1 (PTC1) (see Figure 16-34). Loss-of-function mutations in PTC1 permit cell proliferation in the absence of an Hh signal; thus PTC1 is a tumor-suppressor gene. People who inherit a single working copy of PTC1 have a propensity to develop skin and brain cancer; either can occur when the remaining allele is damaged. Other people can get these diseases too if they lose both copies of the gene. Thus there are both familial and sporadic cases of these diseases, just as in retinoblastoma. Mutations in other genes in the Hh signaling pathway are also associated with cancer. Some such mutations create oncogenes that turn on Hh target genes inappropriately; others are recessive mutations that affect negative regulators such as PTC1. As is the case for a number of other tumor-suppressor genes, complete loss of PTC1 function would lead to early fetal death, since the protein is needed for development, so it is only the tumor cells that are homozygous (ptc1/ptc1).

Many of the signaling pathways described in other chapters also play roles in controlling embryonic development and cell proliferation in adult tissues. In recent years, mutations affecting components of most of these signaling pathways have been linked to cancer. Indeed, once one gene in a developmental pathway has been linked to a type of human cancer, knowledge of that pathway gleaned from model organisms such as worms, flies, or mice allows focused investigations of the possible involvement of additional pathway genes in other cases of the cancer. For example, APC, a gene that is mutated on the path to colon cancer, is now known to be part of the Wnt signaling pathway (see Chapter 16). That knowledge, in turn, led to the discovery of $\beta$-catenin mutations in colon cancer.

Mutations in tumor-suppressor developmental genes promote tumor formation in tissues where the affected gene normally helps restrain growth. Thus these mutations do not cause cancers in tissues where the primary role of the developmental regulator is to control cell fate-what type of cell develops-but not cell division. Mutations in developmental proto-oncogenes may induce tumor formation in tissues where an affected gene normally promotes cell proliferation or in another tissue where the gene has become aberrantly active.

Transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF- $\beta$ ), despite its name, inhibits proliferation of many cell types, including most epithelial and immune-system cells. Binding of TGF- $\beta$ to its receptor activates cytosolic Smad transcription factors (see Figure 16-3). After translocating to the nucleus, Smads
can promote expression of the gene encoding p15, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4), which causes cells to arrest in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$. TGF- $\beta$ signaling also promotes expression of genes encoding extracellular matrix proteins and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), which reduces the plasmin-catalyzed degradation of the matrix. Loss-of-function mutations in either TGF- $\beta$ receptors or in Smads thus promote cell proliferation and probably contribute to the invasiveness and metastasis of tumor cells (Figure 24-24). Such mutations have in fact been found in a variety of human cancers. For example, deletion of the Smad4 gene occurs in many

FIGURE 24-24 Effect of loss of TGF- $\beta$ signaling. Binding of TGF- $\beta$, an anti-growth factor, to its receptor causes activation of Smad transcription factors. In the absence of effective TGF- $\beta$ signaling owing to either a receptor mutation or a Smad mutation, cell proliferation and invasion of the surrounding extracellular matrix increase. See X. Hua et al., 1998, Genes \& Dev. 12:3084.

human pancreatic cancers; retinoblastoma and colon cancer cells lack functional TGF- $\beta$ receptors and therefore are unresponsive to TGF- $\beta$ growth inhibition.

## Genes That Regulate Apoptosis Can Function as Proto-oncogenes or Tumor-Suppressor Genes

During normal development, many cells are designated for programmed cell death, also known as apoptosis (see Chapter 21). Many abnormalities, including errors in mitosis, DNA damage, or an abnormal excess of cells not needed for development of a working organ, can trigger apoptosis. For some cells, apoptosis appears to be the default situation, and signals are required to ensure cell survival. Cells can receive instructions to live and instructions to die, and a complex regulatory system integrates these various kinds of information.

If cells do not die when they should and instead keep proliferating, a tumor may form. For example, chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) occurs because cells survive when they should not. The cells accumulate slowly, and most are not actively dividing, but they do not die. CLL cells have chromosomal translocations that activate a gene called $B C L 2$, which we now know to be a critical blocker of apoptosis (see Figure 21-38). The resultant inappropriate overproduction of BCL2 protein prevents normal apoptosis and allows survival of these tumor cells. CLL tumors are therefore attributable to a failure of cell death. Another dozen or so proto-oncogenes that are normally involved in negatively regulating apoptosis have been found to be mutated to become oncogenes. Overproduction of their encoded proteins prevents apoptosis even when it is needed to stop cancer cells from growing.

Conversely, genes whose protein products stimulate apoptosis behave as tumor suppressors. An example is the PTEN gene discussed in Chapter 16. The phosphatase encoded by this gene dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, a secondary messenger that functions in activation of AKT (see Figure 16-29). Cells lacking PTEN phosphatase have elevated levels of phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and active AKT, which promotes cell survival, growth, and proliferation and prevents apoptosis by several pathways. Thus PTEN acts as a pro-apoptotic tumor suppressor by decreasing the anti-apoptotic and proliferation-promoting effects of AKT.

The most common pro-apoptotic tumor-suppressor gene implicated in human cancers is $p 53$. Among the genes activated by p53 are several encoding pro-apoptotic proteins such as BAX (see Figure 21-38). As we will discuss in Section 24.5, when cells suffer extensive DNA damage or numerous other stresses such as hypoxia, the p53-induced expression of proapoptotic proteins leads to their quick demise. While apoptosis may seem like a drastic response to DNA damage, it prevents proliferation of cells that are likely to accumulate multiple mutations. When p53 function is lost, apoptosis cannot be induced, and the accumulation of mutations required for cancer to develop and progress becomes more likely.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 24.4

## Misregulation of Cell Growth and Death Pathways in Cancer

- Mutations that permit receptors for growth factors to dimerize in the absence of their normal ligands lead to constitutive receptor activity (see Figure 24-20). Overproduction of growth-factor receptors can have the same effect and lead to abnormal cell proliferation.
- Most tumor cells produce constitutively active forms of one or more intracellular signal-transducing proteins, causing growth-promoting signaling in the absence of normal growth factors (see Figure 24-21).
- Inappropriate production of nuclear transcription factors such as FOS, JUN, and MYC can induce transformation. In Burkitt's lymphoma cells, MYC is translocated close to an antibody gene, leading to overproduction of MYC (see Figure 24-23).
- Many genes that regulate normal developmental processes encode proteins that function in various signaling pathways. Their normal roles in regulating where and when growth occurs are reflected in the character of the tumors that arise when these genes are mutated.
- Loss of signaling by TGF- $\beta$, a negative growth regulator, promotes cell proliferation and development of malignancy (see Figure 24-24).
- Overexpression of anti-apoptotic genes or loss of proapoptotic genes promotes tumorigenesis. The pro-apoptotic gene $p 53$ is frequently mutated in cancers.


### 24.5 Deregulation of the Cell Cycle and Genome Maintenance Pathways in Cancer

The complex mechanisms that regulate the eukaryotic cell cycle are prime targets for oncogenic mutations. Both positively and negatively acting proteins precisely control the entry of cells into the cell cycle and their progression through it. In addition, cells harbor surveillance mechanismsknown as checkpoint pathways-that ensure that cells do not enter the next phase of the cell cycle before the previous one has been correctly completed. For example, cells that have sustained damage to their DNA are normally arrested before their DNA is replicated, or in $\mathrm{G}_{2}$ before chromosome segregation. This arrest of the cell cycle allows time for the DNA damage to be repaired; alternatively, cells are directed to commit suicide via apoptosis. The cell cycle control and checkpoint systems function to prevent cells from becoming cancerous. As might be expected, mutations in this system often lead to abnormal development or contribute to cancer.

In this section, we discuss the cell cycle checkpoint pathways that are affected in cancer. We first describe how the checkpoint pathway that controls entry into the cell cycle is mutated and misregulated in most human cancers. We then

discuss how p53 prevents tumorigenesis by helping cells to respond to DNA damage. We end with a discussion of how defects in DNA repair enzymes contribute to cancer by compromising the cell's ability to repair DNA damage.

## Mutations That Promote Unregulated Passage from $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ to S Phase Are Oncogenic

Once a cell progresses past a certain point in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, called the restriction point, it becomes irreversibly committed to entering S phase and replicating its DNA (see Figure 19-12). Cyclin Ds, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), and the Rb protein are all elements of the control system that regulates passage through the restriction point.

The pathway that controls entry into the cell cycle is estimated to be misregulated in approximately 80 percent of human cancers. At the heart of this pathway are cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes and the transcription inhibitor RB (Figure 24-25). The expression of cyclin D genes is induced by many extracellular growth factors, or mitogens. These cyclins assemble with a partner, CDK4 or CDK6, to generate catalytically active cyclin-CDK complexes, whose kinase activity promotes progression through $\mathrm{G}_{1}$. Mitogen withdrawal prior to passage through the restriction point leads to accumulation of two CDK inhibitors. As described in Chapter 19, these two proteins, p15 and p16, bind to cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes and inhibit their activity, thereby causing $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ arrest. The transcription inhibitor RB is controlled by cyclin D-CDK4/6 phosphorylation. Nonphosphorylated RB binds to E2F transcription factors, which stimulate transcription of genes encoding proteins required for DNA synthesis. Under normal circumstances, phosphorylation of RB protein is initiated midway through $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ by active cyclin D-CDK4/6 complexes. RB phosphorylation is completed by cyclin E-CDK2 complexes in late $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, allowing
![li25135345559](li25135345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-25 Restriction point control. Nonphosphorylated RB protein binds transcription factors collectively called E2Fs and thereby prevents E2F-mediated transcriptional activation of many genes whose products (e.g., DNA polymerase) are required for DNA synthesis. The kinase activity of cyclin D-CDK4/6 phosphorylates RB, thereby inactivating RB and activating E2Fs; cyclin D-CDK4/6 activity is inhibited by p16. Overproduction of cyclin D, a positive regulator, or loss of the negative regulators p16 and RB commonly occurs in human cancers.
release and activation of E2Fs and progression from $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ to S . The complete phosphorylation of RB and its disassociation from E2Fs irreversibly commits the cell to DNA synthesis.

Most tumors contain an oncogenic mutation that causes the overproduction or loss of one of the components of the pathway that controls entry into S phase, so that the cells are propelled into S phase in the absence of the proper extracellular growth signals. For example, elevated levels of cyclin D1, one of the three cyclin Ds, are found in many human cancers. In certain tumors of antibody-producing B lymphocytes, the cyclin D1 gene is translocated such that its transcription is under the control of an antibody-gene enhancer, causing elevated cyclin D1 production throughout the cell cycle irrespective of extracellular signals. (This phenomenon is analogous to the MYC translocation in Burkitt's lymphoma cells discussed earlier.) That cyclin D1 can function as an oncoprotein was shown by studies with transgenic mice in which the cyclin D1 gene was placed under the control of an enhancer specific for mammary duct cells. Initially, the duct cells underwent hyperproliferation, and eventually breast tumors developed in these transgenic mice. A second mechanism that can lead to overproduction of cyclin D is gene amplification. Amplification of the cyclin D1 gene and concomitant overproduction of the cyclin D1 protein is common in human breast cancers; the extra cyclin D1 helps to drive cells through the cell cycle.

We have already seen that inactivating mutations in both $R B$ alleles lead to childhood retinoblastoma, a relatively rare type of cancer. However, loss of $R B$ gene function is also found in more common cancers that arise later in life (e.g., carcinomas of lung, breast, and bladder). These tissues, unlike retinal tissue, probably produce other proteins (e.g., p107 and p130, both structurally related to RB) whose function is redundant with that of RB, and thus RB is not so critical for preventing cancer in these tissues. In the retina, however, regulation of cell cycle entry appears to rely exclusively on the RB protein, which is why patients heterozygous for the RB gene first develop tumors in this tissue. RB function can be eliminated not only by inactivating mutations, but also by the binding of an inhibitory protein, designated E7, that is encoded by human papillomavirus (HPV), another nasty viral trick to create virus-producing tissue. At present, this binding is known to occur only in cervical and oropharyngeal cancers.

The proteins that function as cyclin-CDK inhibitors play an important role in regulating the cell cycle. In particular, loss-of-function mutations that prevent p16 from inhibiting cyclin D-CDK4/6 kinase activity are common in several human cancers. As Figure 24-25 makes clear, loss of p16 mimics overproduction of cyclin Ds. Thus p16 normally acts as a tumor suppressor. Although the p16 tumor-suppressor gene is deleted in some human cancers, the p16 sequence is normal in others. In some of these latter cancers (e.g., lung cancer), the p16 gene, or genes encoding other functionally related proteins, is inactivated by hypermethylation of its promoter region, which prevents its transcription. What promotes this change in the methylation of $p 16$ is not known, but it prevents production of this important cell cycle control protein.

The locus encoding p16 is highly unusual in that it encodes no less than three tumor-suppressor genes, which

![li25235345559](li25235345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-26 The INK4b-ARF-INK4a locus encodes three tumorsuppressor genes. Exons are designated as E. The two INK4b exons (orange) are located upstream of the ARF/INK4a locus. ARF (blue) is encoded by a unique E1 $\beta$ exon but shares exons E2 and E3 with INK4a (green). INK4b and INK4a encode p15 and p16, respectively. ARF encodes a p53 activator. [Data from C. Sherr, 2006, Nat. Rev. Cancer 6:663-673.]
makes it the most vulnerable locus in the human genome to oncogenic changes. In addition to harboring the p16-encoding gene, INK4a (CDKN2A), it has the INK4b (CDKN2B) locus immediately upstream, which encodes p15, another cyclin D-CDK4/6 inhibitor (Figure 24-26). In addition, the locus encodes a key activator of the tumor suppressor p53. This protein, p14ARF (p19ARF in the mouse), is encoded by an exon upstream of the first INK4a exon and shares its exon 2 and exon 3 with INK4a. As we will see next, this protein controls the stability of p53. Thus mutations in
this locus can simultaneously affect the two major tumorsuppressor pathways in the cell, the RB and p53 pathways.

## Loss of p53 Abolishes the DNA Damage Checkpoint

The protein p53 is a central player in tumorigenesis. It is thought that most, if not all, human tumors have mutations either in p53 itself or in proteins that regulate p53 activity. Cells with functional p53 become arrested in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ when exposed to DNA-damaging irradiation, whereas cells lacking functional p53 do not. Unlike other cell cycle proteins, p53 is present at very low levels in normal cells because it is extremely unstable and rapidly degraded. Mice lacking p53 are largely viable and healthy except for a predisposition to develop multiple types of tumors.

In normal mice, the amount of p53 protein is heightened-a post-transcriptional response-only in stressful situations such as exposure to UV or $\gamma$-irradiation, heat, or hypoxia. Irradiation by $\gamma$-rays creates lesions in the DNA. Serine kinases ATM or ATR are recruited to these sites of damage and are activated. They then phosphorylate p53 on a serine residue in the N -terminus of the protein. This phosphorylation causes the protein to evade ubiquitin-mediated degradation, leading to a marked increase in its concentration (Figure 24-27).
![li25335345559](li25335345559.jpg)

FIGURE 24-27 Arrest in $G_{1}$ in response to DNA damage. The kinase activity of ATM is activated in response to DNA damage due to various stresses (e.g., UV irradiation, heat). Activated ATM then triggers three pathways leading to arrest in $G_{1}: \square \mathrm{Chk} 2$ is phosphorylated and, in turn, phosphorylates Cdc25A, thereby marking it for degradation and blocking its role in CDK2 activation. In a second pathway, phosphorylation of p53 stabilizes it, permitting p53-activated expression of genes encoding proteins that cause arrest in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, promote apoptosis, or participate in DNA repair. The third pathway is another way of controlling the pool of p53. The MDM2 protein in its active form can form a complex
with p53, inhibiting the transcription factor and causing p53 ubiquitinylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. ATM phosphorylates MDM2 to inactivate it, causing increased stabilization of p53. In addition, MDM2 levels are controlled by p14ARF (p19ARF in the mouse), which binds MDM2 and sequesters it in the nucleolus, where it cannot access p53. The p14ARF gene is induced by high levels of mitogenic signaling, which are frequently observed in cells carrying oncogenic mutations in growth factor signaling pathways. The human MDM2 gene is frequently amplified in sarcomas, which presumably causes excessive inactivation of p53. Similarly, p14ARF is also found mutated in some cancers.

The stabilized p53 activates transcription of the gene encoding p21, which binds to and inhibits mammalian cyclin E-CDK2. As a result, cells with damaged DNA are arrested in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$, allowing time for DNA repair by the mechanisms discussed in Chapter 5, or permanently arrested-that is, they become senescent. The activity of p53 is not limited to inducing cell cycle arrest, however. In addition, this multipurpose tumor suppressor stimulates production of pro-apoptotic proteins (as we will see shortly) and DNA-repair enzymes (see Figure 24-27). Senescence and apoptosis may in fact be the most important means through which p53 prevents tumor growth.

The activity of p53 is normally kept low by a protein called MDM2. When MDM2 is bound to p53, it inhibits the transcription-activating ability of p53 and at the same time, because it has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, catalyzes the ubiquitinylation of p53, thus targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Phosphorylation of p53 by ATM or ATR displaces bound MDM2 from p53, thereby stabilizing it. Because the MDM2 gene is itself transcriptionally activated by p53, MDM2 functions in an autoregulatory feedback loop with p53, perhaps normally preventing excess p53 function. The MDM2 gene is amplified in many sarcomas and other human tumors that contain a normal p53 gene. Even though functional p53 is produced by such tumor cells, the elevated MDM2 levels reduce the p53 concentration enough to abolish the p53-induced arrest in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ in response to irradiation. A key regulator of MDM2 is the p14ARF protein, encoded by the multi-tumor-suppressor locus that also encodes the INK4 proteins. The p14ARF protein binds to MDM2 and sequesters it in the nucleolus, away from p53. Normal p14ARF levels are so low in tissues that the protein is barely detectable-otherwise, it would cause p53 accumulation and hence cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. However, in response to oncogenic signaling-that is, in the presence of high levels of pro-proliferation signals-p14ARF transcription is induced by the E2F transcription factor. Thus p14ARF is an important inhibitor of tumorigenesis, since it induces p53 activation when pro-proliferation signaling reaches unphysiologically high levels through hyperactivating mutations in the signaling pathways. For pro-proliferation signaling pathways to cause uncontrolled proliferation, as is seen in cancer, this p53 up-regulation must not occur. It is therefore not surprising that p53 is inactive in most human tumors through loss of p53 function itself, down-regulation of positive regulators of p53 function such as p14ARF, or up-regulation of negative regulators of p53 such as MDM2.

The activity of p53 is also inhibited by a human papillomavirus (HPV) protein called E6. HPV encodes two proteins that contribute to its ability to induce stable transformation and mitosis in a variety of cultured cells. These proteins, E6 and E7, bind to and inhibit the p53 and RB tumor suppressors, respectively. Acting together, E6 and E7 are sufficient to induce transformation in the absence of mutations in cell proliferation regulatory proteins.

The active form of p53 is a tetramer of four identical subunits. A missense point mutation in one of the two p53 alleles in a cell can abrogate almost all p53 activity because virtually all the oligomers will contain at least one defective
subunit, and such oligomers have reduced ability to activate transcription. Oncogenic p53 mutations thus act in a dominant-negative manner, in which a single mutant allele causes a loss of function. The loss of function is incomplete, so in order to grow more rapidly, tumor cells still sometimes lose the remaining functional allele (loss of heterozygosity). As we learned in Chapter 6, dominant-negative mutations can occur in proteins whose active forms are multimeric or whose function depends on interactions with other proteins. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations in other tumorsuppressor genes (e.g., $R B$ ) are recessive because the encoded proteins function as monomers and mutation of a single allele has little functional consequence.

The p53 protein is a key defense mechanism against oncogenic transformation. This is best illustrated by the observation that loss-of-function mutations in the p53 gene occur in more than 50 percent of human cancers. What does p53 protect us against? Unlike Rb, which prevents inappropriate proliferation, p53 guards the cell from genetic changes. When the p53 $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ checkpoint control does not operate properly, damaged DNA can replicate, generating mutations and DNA rearrangements that are passed on to daughter cells and make their transformation into metastatic cells more likely. For example, loss of p53 function leads to a hundredfold or greater increase in the frequency of gene amplification. At the same time, loss of p53 function prevents apoptosis, contributing to evolution of transformed cells. Because of its central role in preventing tumorigenesis, researchers are intensely searching for compounds that can restore p53 function as a new way of treating a broad spectrum of human tumors.

## Loss of DNA-Repair Systems Can Lead to Cancer

As our previous discussion has shown, alterations in DNA that lead to the malfunction of tumor-suppressor proteins and the production of oncoproteins are the underlying cause of most cancers. These oncogenic mutations in key growth and cell cycle regulatory genes include insertions, deletions, and base substitutions as well as chromosomal amplifications and translocations. Damage to DNA-repair systems (see Chapter 5) leads to an increased rate of these genetic alterations. Of the many mutations that accumulate in cells with defects in DNA repair mechanisms, some affect cell cycle regulators, some cell adhesion, and some the ability to migrate through basement membranes, discussed at the beginning of this chapter. Cells that have accumulated these kinds of mutations may become cancerous. Furthermore, some DNA-repair mechanisms themselves are error prone (see Figure 6-37). Those errors also contribute to oncogenesis. The inability of tumor cells to maintain genomic integrity leads to the formation of a heterogeneous population of malignant cells. For this reason, chemotherapy directed toward a single gene, or even a group of genes, is likely to be ineffective in wiping out all malignant cells. This problem adds to the interest in therapies that interfere with the blood supply to tumors, target aneuploid cells, or in other ways act on multiple types of tumor cells.

Normal dividing cells usually employ several mechanisms to prevent the accumulation of detrimental mutations that could lead to cancer. One form of protection against mutation for stem cells is their relatively low rate of division, which reduces the possibility of DNA damage incurred during DNA replication and mitosis. Furthermore, the progeny of stem cells do not have the ability to divide indefinitely. After several rounds of division, they exit the cell cycle, reducing the possibility of mutation-induced misregulation of cell division associated with dangerous tumors. Furthermore, if multiple mutations are required for a tumor to grow, attract a blood supply, invade neighboring tissues, and metastasize, a low rate of replication combined with the normal low rate of mutations $\left(10^{-9}\right)$ provides further shielding from cancer. However, these safeguards can be overcome if a powerful mutagen reaches the cells, or if DNA repair is compromised and the mutation rate rises. When cells with stem cell-like growth properties are mutated by environmental poisons and are unable to efficiently repair the damage, cancer can occur.

Even without exposure to any external carcinogens or mutagens, normal biological processes generate a large amount of DNA damage. That damage is due to depurination reactions, to alkylation reactions, and to the generation of reactive species such as oxygen radicals, all of which alter DNA. It has been estimated that in every cell, more than 20,000 alterations to the DNA occur each day from reactive oxygen
species and depurination. Thus DNA repair is a crucial defense system against genetic change, and hence against cancer.

The normal role of genome maintenance genes is to prevent or repair DNA damage. Loss of the high-fidelity DNArepair systems that are described in Chapter 5 correlates with increased risk for cancer. For example, people who inherit mutations in genes that encode a crucial mismatch-repair or excision-repair protein have an enormously increased probability of developing certain cancers (Table 24-2). Without proper DNA repair, people with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome) have a propensity to accumulate mutations in many other genes, including those that are critical in controlling cell growth and proliferation. XP causes affected people to develop skin cancer at about a thousand times the normal rate. Seven of the eight known XP genes encode components of the excision-repair machinery, and in the absence of this repair mechanism, genes that control the cell cycle or otherwise regulate cell growth and death become mutated. HNPCC genes encode components of the mismatch-repair system, and mutations in these genes are found in 20 percent of sporadic colon cancers. The cancers progress from benign polyps to full-fledged tumors much more rapidly than usual, presumably because the initial cancer cells are undergoing continuous mismatch mutagenesis without repair.

One gene frequently mutated in colon cancers because of the absence of mismatch repair encodes the type II receptor for TGF- $\beta$ (see Figure 24-24). The gene encoding this receptor contains a sequence of 10 adenines in a row. Because of "slippage" of DNA polymerase during replication, this sequence often undergoes mutation to a sequence containing 9 or 11 adenines. If the mutation is not fixed by the mismatchrepair system, the resultant frameshift in the protein-coding sequence abolishes production of the normal receptor protein. As noted earlier, such inactivating mutations make cells resistant to growth inhibition by TGF- $\beta$, thereby contributing to the unregulated growth characteristic of these tumors. This finding attests to the importance of mismatch repair in correcting genetic damage that might otherwise lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation.

All DNA-repair mechanisms use a family of DNA polymerases different from the standard $\operatorname{Pol} \alpha, \operatorname{Pol} \delta$, and $\operatorname{Pol} \varepsilon$ replicative DNA polymerases to correct DNA damage. Nine of these polymerases, including one called DNA polymerase $\beta$, are capable of using templates that contain DNA adducts and other chemical modifications, even missing bases. These enzymes are called lesion-bypass DNA polymerases. Each member of this polymerase family has distinct capabilities to cope with particular types of DNA lesions. Presumably such polymerases are tolerated because often any repair is better than none. They are the polymerases of last resort, the ones used when more conventional and accurate polymerases are unable to perform, and they carry out a mutagenic replication process. DNA Pol $\beta$ does not proofread and is overexpressed in certain tumors, perhaps because it is needed at high levels for cells to be able to divide at all in the face of a growing burden of mutations. Error-prone repair systems are thought to mediate much, if not all, of the carcinogenic effect of chemicals and radiation, since it is only after the repair that a heritable mutation exists. There is growing evidence that mutations in DNA Pol $\beta$ are associated with tumors. When 189 tumors were examined, 58 had mutations in the DNA Pol $\beta$ gene, and most of these mutations were found neither in normal tissue from the same patient nor in the normal spectrum of mutations found in different people. Expressing two of the mutant polymerase forms in mouse cells caused them to grow with a transformed appearance and an ability to form foci.

Double-strand breaks are particularly severe lesions because incorrect rejoining of double strands of DNA can lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements and translocations, such as those that produce a hybrid gene or bring a growth regulatory gene under the control of a different promoter or enhancer. Often the repair of such damage depends on using the homologous chromosome as a guide (see Figure 6-39). The B and T cells of the immune system are particularly susceptible to DNA rearrangements caused by double-strand breaks created during rearrangement of their immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor genes, which explains the frequent involvement of these loci in leukemias and lymphomas. BRCA1 and BRCA2, genes implicated in human breast and ovarian cancers, encode important components of DNA-break repair systems. Cells lacking either of the BRCA
functions are unable to repair DNA where the homologous chromosome is providing the template for repair.

## KEY CONCEPTS OF SECTION 24.5

## Deregulation of the Cell Cycle and Genome Maintenance Pathways in Cancer

- Overexpression of the proto-oncogene encoding cyclin D1 or loss of the tumor-suppressor genes encoding p16 and RB can cause inappropriate, unregulated passage through the restriction point. Such abnormalities are seen in 80 percent of human tumors.
- The INK4-ARF locus represents the most frequently mutated tumor-suppressor locus in humans, controlling both the RB and p53 pathways.
- The p53 protein is a multifunctional tumor suppressor that promotes arrest in $\mathrm{G}_{1}$ and DNA repair or apoptosis in response to damaged DNA.
- Loss-of-function mutations in the p53 gene occur in more than 50 percent of human cancers. Overproduction of MDM2, a protein that normally inhibits the activity of p53, or inactivation of p14ARF, which also increases MDM2 activity, occur in several cancers that express normal p53 protein. Thus, in one way or another, the p53 stress-response pathway is inactivated to allow tumor growth.
- Human papillomavirus (HPV) encodes two oncogenic proteins: E6, which inhibits p53, and E7, which inhibits RB.
- Genome maintenance genes encode enzymes that repair DNA, or otherwise maintain the integrity of the chromosomes when DNA damage does occur. Mutations in genome maintenance genes lead to a high rate of mutagenesis of the genome that can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and accumulation of additional mutations, resulting in progression to metastatic cancer.
- Inherited defects in DNA-repair processes found in certain human diseases are associated with an increased susceptibility for certain cancers.

## Review the Concepts

1. Despite differences in origin, cancer cells have several features in common that differentiate them from normal cells. Describe these.
2. What characteristics distinguish benign from malignant tumors?
3. Which important characteristic of tumor cells did Otto Warburg discover?
4. Because of oxygen and nutrient requirements, cells in a tissue must reside within $100 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ of a blood vessel. Based on this information, explain why many malignant tumors often possess gain-of-function mutations in one of the following genes: $\beta F G F, T G F-\alpha$, and VEGF.
5. Ninety percent of cancer deaths are caused by metastatic rather than primary tumors. Define metastasis. Explain the rationale for the following new cancer treatments: (a) batimastat, an inhibitor of matrix metalloproteases and of the plasminogen activator receptor, (b) antibodies that block the function of integrins, integral membrane proteins that mediate attachment of cells to the basement membrane and extracellular matrices of various tissues.
6. What is the importance of the EMT during metastasis?
7. What hypothesis explains the observations that incidence of human cancers increases exponentially with age? Give an example of data that confirm the hypothesis.
8. Distinguish between proto-oncogenes and tumorsuppressor genes. To become cancer promoting, do proto-oncogenes and tumor-suppressor genes undergo gain-of-function or loss-of-function mutations? Classify the following genes as proto-oncogenes or tumor-suppressor genes: $p 53$, ras, $B C L-2, J U N, M D M 2$, and $p 16$.
9. Describe how mutations in genome maintenance factors promote tumorigenesis. Why would inactivation of a mismatch repair gene cause colon cancer?
10. Hereditary retinoblastoma generally affects children in both eyes, while spontaneous retinoblastoma usually occurs during adulthood only in one eye. Explain the genetic basis for the epidemiological distinction between these two forms of retinoblastoma. Explain the apparent paradox: loss-of-function mutations in tumor-suppressor genes act recessively, yet hereditary retinoblastoma is inherited as an autosomal dominant.
11. Explain the concept of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Why do most cancer cells exhibit LOH of one or more genes? How does failure of the spindle assembly checkpoint lead to loss of heterozygosity?
12. Many malignant tumors are characterized by the activation of one or more growth-factor receptors. What is the catalytic activity associated with transmembrane growthfactor receptors such as the EGF receptor? Describe how a point mutation that converts a valine to glutamine within the transmembrane region of the HER2 receptor leads to activation of the relevant growth-factor receptor.
13. Describe the common signal transduction event that is perturbed by cancer-promoting mutations in the genes encoding RAS and NF-1. Why are mutations in RAS more commonly found in cancers than mutations in NF-1?
14. Describe the mutational event that produces the MYC oncogene in Burkitt's lymphoma. Why does the particular mechanism for generating oncogenic MYC result in a lymphoma rather than another type of cancer? Describe another mechanism for generating oncogenic MYC.
15. Pancreatic cancers often possess loss-of-function mutations in the gene that encodes the Smad4 protein. How does this mutation promote the loss of growth inhibition and highly metastatic phenotype seen in pancreatic tumors?
16. Why are mutations in the INK4 locus so dangerous?
17. Explain how epigenetic changes can contribute to tumorigenesis.
18. Several strains of human papilloma virus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer. These pathogenic strains produce three proteins that contribute to host-cell transformation. What are these three viral proteins? Describe how each interacts with its target host protein.
19. Loss of p53 function occurs in the majority of human tumors. Name two ways in which loss of p53 function contributes to a malignant phenotype. Explain how benzo(a) pyrene can cause loss of p53 function.
